Then \(\lnot(F) = T\).

**Result:** \(\lnot(T \ \& \ F) = T\)

**2. Simplify \((h \ \& \ T)\):**

Since \(T\) is always True, \(h \ \& \ T = h\).

**Result:** \((h \ \& \ T) = h\)

**3. Simplify \(((h \ \& \ T) \ \& \ h)\):**

Substitute the result from the previous step:

\((h \ \& \ h) = h\), because \(h \ \& \ h\) is \(h\), as a variable ANDed with itself is the variable.

**Result:** \(((h \ \& \ T) \ \& \ h) = h\)

**4. Simplify \((h \ | \ T)\):**

Since \(T\) is always True, \(h \ | \ T = T\), because an OR operation with True yields True.

**Result:** \((h \ | \ T) = T\)

**5. Substitute back into the original expression:**

Our expression now looks like:

\[
(j \ \& \ T) \ \& \ T
\]

Since \(j \ \& \ T = j\), because \(T\) is True and an AND operation with True leaves the other operand unchanged.

**Result:** \(j \ \& \ T = j\)

Similarly, \(j \ \& \ T = j\).

**6. Final Simplification:**

We are left with \(j\).

\[
((r \mid (F \& (T \& F))) \& (r \& (r \& (r \mid F))))

Let's break it down step by step, applying logical identities and simplifications.

**1. Simplify inner expressions involving `T` (True) and `F` (False):**

First, consider \((T \& F)\):
\[
T \& F = \text{True AND False} = F
\]

Next, simplify \(F \& (T \& F)\):
\[
F \& F = \text{False AND False} = F

**2. Simplify the left part of the expression:**

Now, the left part becomes:
\[

\]
Since anything OR `False` is the original value:
\[
r \mid F = r
\]

**3. Simplify the right part of the expression:**

First, simplify \((r \mid F)\):
\[
r \mid F = r \mid \text{False} = r
\]

Now, the right part becomes:
\[
r \& (r \& (r \mid F)) = r \& (r \& r) = r \& r \& r
