1. **Logical OR with True (`T`):**

**Step 1: Simplify \(k \& T\)**
- Since \(T\) (True) is the identity element for logical AND (\&), \(k \& T\) simplifies to \(k\).
- So, \((k \& T) \& k\) becomes \(k \& k\).

**Step 2: Simplify \(k \& k\)**
- Logical AND is idempotent, meaning \(k \& k\) simplifies to \(k\).

**Step 3: Simplify \(T \& F\)**
- \(F\) (False) is the annihilator for logical AND, so \(T \& F\) simplifies to \(F\).

**Step 4: Simplify \((T \& F) | T\)**
- Substituting the result from Step 3, we have \(F | T\).
- Since \(T\) is the identity element for logical OR (|), \(F | T\) simplifies to \(T\).
