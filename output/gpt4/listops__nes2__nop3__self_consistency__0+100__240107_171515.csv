A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we find the minimum of the three elements in the first two bracket expressions: MIN 0 4 3 and MIN 8 3 9.

MIN 0 4 3 is 0 because 0 is the smallest number among 0, 4, and 3.

MIN 8 3 9 is 3 i.e. the smallest number among 8, 3, and 9.

Then we substitute these results back into the original expression to get: [SM 0 3 0].
