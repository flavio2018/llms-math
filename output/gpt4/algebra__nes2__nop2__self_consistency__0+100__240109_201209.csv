A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, you can simplify the terms within each pair of parentheses:

((+98*y-5*y)+(-71*y-74*y)) = (93*y) + (-145*y).

Next, you combine like terms:

(93*y) + (-145*y) = -52*y.

Now, if you are asked to compute the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient, you apply the modulo operation to -52:

-52 modulo -100 = -52. 

So, the simplified expression is -52*y, and the corresponding modulo operation gives -52.",-52*y,+48*y

((+3*x*y-61*x*y)+(+49*x*y+66*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we combine similar terms in the parentheses:
(+3*x*y - 61*x*y) and (+49*x*y + 66*x*y)

which simplifies to:
-58*x*y and 115*x*y.

Taking the modulo 100:
-58*x*y becomes -58 (since -58 mod -100 is -58),
and 115*x*y becomes 15 (since 115 mod 100 is 15). 

Finally, we add these two simplifications:
-58*x*y + 15*x*y

which simplifies to:
-43*x*y

Taking the modulo -100, -43*x*y becomes -43 (since -43 mod -100 is -43).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we combine like terms in each parentheses:
+37*y+74*y = 111*y
+94*y+64*y = 158*y

Then, we compute modulo 100 of each numerical coefficient:
111 mod 100 = 11 (positive)
158 mod 100 = 58 (positive)

So, the simplified expression is:
11*y + 58*y = 69*y.

So, we have (-67*a*b*x*y)+(-76*a*b*x*y).

Adding these together, we get -143*a*b*x*y.

Applying the modulo 100 rule, -143 is negative so we compute its modulo -100 which is -43.
