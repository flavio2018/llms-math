A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we'll solve the MIN functions: 
    MIN 1 4 3 is 1
    MIN 3 1 2 is 1
    MIN 3 6 0 is 0
    MIN 0 9 0 is 0
    SM 1 3 9 is 13, but we take modulo 10, so it's 3

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's clarify. ""SM"" means taking the sum of the numbers and finding the remnant when dividing by 10 (modulo). ""MIN"" means finding the smallest number in the list. ""MAX"" means finding the largest number in the list.

We will begin with the innernest brackets. We solve calculations in brackets first, starting from the innermost.

SM [SM 6 7 6] turns into 9 (6 + 7 + 6 = 19, but we take it modulo 10, so it's 9).

SM 7 3 1 turns into 1 (7 + 3 + 1 = 11, but we take it modulo 10, so it's 1).

Now you have [MIN 9 2 1]. MIN picks the smallest number, so it's 1.

Similarly, 

SM 6 9 3 turns into 8 (6 + 9 + 3 = 18, modulo 10 is 8).

MAX 0 4 6 is 6 (as 6 is the maximum number).

MIN 8 6 6 is 6 (as 6 is the minimum number).

Your expression is now turned into a simpler form: [SM [MIN 1 8 6] [MAX 4 [MIN 6 [MAX 1 5 6] [MAX 9 4 1]] [SM[Max 1 4 2] 6 [MAX 2 2 8]]] 0].

For the second part:

MAX 1 5 6 is 6 (6 is the maximum number).

MIN 6 6 9 is 6 (6 is the minimum number).

We can replace the [MIN 6 [MAX 1 5 6] [MAX 9 4 1]] with 6.

Then, 

MAX 1 4 2 is 4 (as 4 is the largest number).

SM 4 6 8 is 8 (8 is the sum modulo 10).

Max 2 2 8 is 8 (8 is the maximum number).

Then
MIN 1 8 6 is 1.

Finally, 

SM 1 6 8 0 is 5.

So the answer to [SM [MIN [SM [SM 6 7 6] 2 [SM 7 3 1]] 8 [MIN [SM 6 9 3] [MAX 0 4 6] 6]] [MAX 4 [MIN 6 [MAX 1 5 6] [MAX 9 4 1]] [SM [MAX 1 4 2] 6 [MAX 2 2 8]]] 0] is 5.",5,0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: We start by simplifying the innermost operations.
[MIN 4 4 2] = 2 (since 2 is the minimum)
[MIN 7 5 7] = 5 (since 5 is the minimum)
[MIN 9 7 1] = 1 (since 1 is the minimum)
[SM 5 4 0] = (5+4+0) mod 10 = 9 (as it's sum modulo 10)
[MAX 6 9 5] = 9 (since 9 is the maximum)
[MAX 0 4 0] = 4 (since 4 is the maximum)
[MAX 9 0 9] = 9 (since 9 is the maximum)

So the expression becomes 
[MIN [MAX [SM 0 2 5] 7 [SM 1 5 [SM 9 9 3]]] [SM [SM 9 9 2] 3 [MIN 4 4 9]] 2].

Step 2: Simplify the next set of operations.
[SM 0 2 5] = (0+2+5) mod 10 = 7 (as it's sum modulo 10)
[SM 9 9 3] = (9+9+3) mod 10 = 1 (as it's sum modulo 10)
[SM 9 9 2] = (9+9+2) mod 10 = 0 (as it's sum modulo 10)

So the expression becomes 
[MIN [MAX 7 7 [SM 1 5 1]] [SM 0 3 [MIN 4 4 9]] 2].

Step 3: Simplify the next set of operations:
[SM 1 5 1] = (1+5+1) mod 10 = 7 (as it's sum modulo 10)
[MIN 4 4 9] = 4 (since 4 is the minimum)

So the expression becomes 
[MIN [MAX 7 7 7] [SM 0 3 4] 2].

Step 4: Simplify the next set of operations:
[MAX 7 7 7] = 7 (since 7 is the maximum)
[SM 0 3 4] = (0+3+4) mod 10 = 7 (as it's sum modulo 10)

So the expression finally becomes

- SM [4 8 1] = 3 (as 4+8+1=13, 13 modulo 10 = 3).

Replace these values in the expression:

- MIN [MAX 6 3 0] = MIN 6 = 6,
- MIN [MAX 6 6 3] = MIN 6 = 6,

- MIN 4 [SM 2 4 4] = MIN 4 0 = 0 (as 2+4+4=10, 10 modulo 10 = 0).

Replace these values in the expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to solve all operators in the innermost brackets. The maximum (MAX) of 9,4,0 is 9. The sum (SM) of 0,4,2 modulo 10 is 6, and the sum of 7,4,8 is 9, but we take modulo 10 so the result is also 9. The sum of 8,0,3 is 11, but we take modulo 10, so the result is 1. 

So the expression becomes: 

[MIN 5 [MIN 3 [SM 9 6 7] [MAX 1 3 9]] [SM [SM 2 [SM 1 7 8] [SM 1 6 4]] [MAX 8 [MAX 3 8 4] [MAX 9 5 0]] 0]].

Now we need to solve the next set of operators. The sum (SM) of 9,6,7 is 22, but we take modulo 10 so the result is 2. The maximum (MAX) of 1,3,9 is 9. The sum (SM) of 1,7,8 is 16, but we take modulo 10, so the result is 6, and similarly, the sum of 1,6,4 is 11, so the result is 1. The maximum (MAX) of 3,8,4 is 8, and the maximum of 9,5,0 is 9. 

So the expression becomes: 

[MIN 5 [MIN 3 2 9] [SM [SM 2 6 1] [MAX 8 8 9] 0]]. 

This simplifies to:

The sum (SM) of 2,6,1 is 9, and the sum of 8,0 is 8. This simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the minimum and maximum values among 4,9,2 is 2 and 9 respectively. Therefore, [MIN 4 9 2] = 2 

The minimum and maximum values among 2,4,1 is 1 and 4 respectively. Therefore, [MIN 2 4 1] = 1 

The minimum and maximum values among 3,9,1 is 1 and 9 respectively. Therefore, [MAX 3 9 1] = 9 

The sum 8,9,5 is 22. But 22 modulo 10 equals 2, so [SM 8 9 5] = 2 

The sum 0,2 and the sum 9,7,1 are 2 and 17 respectively. But 17 modulo 10 equals 7, so [SM 0 [MIN 4 9 2]] = 2 and [SM 9 7 1] = 7 

The maximum values among 1,3,9 and 6,0,4 are 9 and 6 respectively. So [MAX 1 3 9] = 9 and [MAX 6 0 4] = 6 

Now,  
[SM 1 [MAX [MIN 2 4 1] 5 [MAX 7 8 1]] [MIN 2 [SM 8 9 5] [MAX 3 9 1]]] 
becomes

Next, we calculate MIN (minimum) part on second level:

MIN 2 4 2 = 2 (smallest among 2, 4 and 2)
MIN 1 4 2 = 1 (smallest among 1, 4 and 2)
MIN 8 3 8 = 3 (smallest among 8, 3 and 8)

Now, we replace these in the original equation and calculate MIN in the first level:

MIN (SM [SM 5 3 4] 9 [MAX 1 [MIN 1 0 5] [MIN 4 9 7]]) 
= MIN (SM 2 9 [MAX 1 0 4])

Now, we calculate MAX (maximum) in the first level:

MAX 1 0 4 = 4 (largest among 1, 0 and 4)

So, we get:

MIN (SM 2 9 4) 6 [SM [MIN 2 5 1] 6 [SM 3 2 5]]

Calculating the SM (Sum modulo 10) part on the first level:

SM 2 9 4 = (2+9+4) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5
SM 3 2 5 = (3+2+5) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0

Now, we calculate the MIN in the first level:

MIN 2 5 1 = 1 (smallest among 2, 5 and 1)

So, we have:

Now, we calculate the SM on first level:

SM 1 6 0 = (1+6+0) mod 10 = 7 mod 10 = 7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: We break down the operations and start solving from the innermost brackets. First, we perform the SUM operations in the brackets:

[SM 1 0 6], [SM 5 1 4], [SM 0 3 8], [SM [MIN 0 0 3] 5 [MAX 2 2 7]]. 

Rolled-up to modulo 10, these become:

7, 0, 1, [SM [MIN 0 0 3] 5 2]

Step 2: Next, we have MIN operations: 

[MIN 2 7 8], [MIN 6 7 3] and [MIN 0 0 3]. 

Surfacing minimal value from each list, we get

2, 3, 0. 

Now we substitute these into the remaining SM operation:

[SM 0 5 2] = 7 (modulo 10).

Step 3: We return to the SM operations to sum up the results from MIN:

1 [SM 7 3 1] = 1 1 (modulo 10).

Step 4: Next, we substitute the results of the above SM and MIN operations into the MAX operations:

[MAX 7 0], [MAX 2 5 0], [MAX 5 2], [MAX 6 [MAX 7 1] [MIN 2 9]], 

Which supra-maximum results in

7, 5, 5, [MAX 6 [MAX 7 1] 9].

Replacing the remaining MAX operations we get:

[MAX 6 7 9] = 9.

Final step: We insert these results into the last SM operation to get:

[SM 1 1 [MAX 7 5 5 9]] = 3 (modulo 10).

[SM 3 0 2] = (3+0+2)%10 = 5,
[SM 7 3 2] = (7+3+2)%10 = 2,
[SM 1 7 4] = (1+7+4)%10 = 2.

Next we solve the MIN and MAX operators:
[MIN 4 2 6] = min(4,2,6) = 2,
[MAX [SM 1 6 1] 8 [MIN 4 2 6]] = max(8,8,2) = 8,
[SM 1 [MIN 8 2 4] [SM 1 7 4]] = 1 + min(8,2,4) + 2 = 5,
[MAX [SM 5 3 5] [SM 8 4 2] 2] = max(3,4,2) = 4.

Then, we substitute these results into the expression:
[MIN 4 [MAX 8 8] 8 [MIN 2 [MIN 4 [SM 3 0 2] [SM 7 3 2]] [SM 1 [MIN 8 2 4] [SM 1 7 4]]]].

3. In [MAX 0 4 3], the maximum integer is 4.
4. In [SM 2 7 5], the sum is 2+7+5=14, modulo 10 will give 4.
5. In [MIN 0 [SM 5 5 2] [MAX 1 8 1]], we need to compute [SM 5 5 2] which is (5+5+2) modulo 10=2 and [MAX 1 8 1] which is 8. Hence, [MIN 0 2 8] is 0.

Moving onto the next part of the expressions,
MIN [7 8 4] = min(7,8,4) = 4
MAX [7 6 6] = max(7,6,6) = 7

   We find maximum value from the list [4,1,8], which is 8.
   We find minimum values in the lists [0, 6, 6] and [2, 1, 2], which are 0 and 1, respectively.
   [MAX 1 [MAX 6 7 0]] becomes [MAX 1 7], because maximum of [6 7 0] is 7. Then the maximum of [1,7] is 7.
   [MIN [MIN 9 2 6] 8] becomes [MIN 2 8] as minimum of [9, 2, 6] is 2, then minimum between 2 and 8 is 2.

SM 0 5 5 = 10, which is 0 (After modulo 10)

Substitute these results into the expression:

The results are 16, 5, 1, 12 respectively.

Again, SM 16 is greater than 10, so we calculate it modulo 10, which results in SM 16 = 6. SM 12 is also greater than 10, so we calculate it modulo 10, which results in SM 12 = 2.

- SM [1 2 6] = (1+2+6) modulo 10 = 9
- SM [3 5 9] = (3+5+9) modulo 10 = 7
- MIN [8 0 0] = min(8,0,0) = 0
- MAX [9 1 9] = max(9,1,9) = 9
- MIN [3 1 6] = min(3,1,6) = 1
- MIN [3 7 4] = min(3,7,4) = 3
- MIN [7 8 3] = min(7,8,3) = 3

Plugging these values to the original expression:

- We have MAX [MIN [8 3 9] [MIN [7 3 0] 7] 7 [MAX [MAX [9 4 1] [MIN [3 3 8] 9]]

Then, let's solve new sub-expressions:

- MAX [9 4 1] = max(9,4,1) = 9
- MIN [3 3 8] = min(3,3,8) = 3

Plugging these values to the expression:

- We have MAX [3 [MIN [0 7] 7] [MAX [9 3] 9]]

Then, solve the new sub-expressions:

- MIN [0 7] = min(0,7) = 0
- MAX [9 3] = max(9,3) = 9

Plugging these values to the expression:

- We have MAX [3 0 9 9]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's take the inner-most operations:

[SM [MAX 0 4 5]] = [SM 5] = 5 because the maximum of [0, 4, 5] is 5 and the sum modulo 10 of 5 is 5.

[MAX 3 9 5] = 9 because the maximum of [3, 9, 5] is 9.

[SM 0 0 7] = 7 because the sum modulo 10 of [0, 0, 7] is 7.

[MAX 9 8 7] = 9 (as MAX is the maximum one of the list).

[MIN 3 9 0] = 0 (as MIN is the minimum one of the list).

[MAX 8 0 1] = 8

[MAX 9 9 7] = 9

[MIN 6 5 9] = 5

[MAX 8 0 5] = 8

[MAX 5 7 5] = 7

Substituting back in:

[SM [MIN 4 5 [SM 8 7 8]] 9 [SM [SM 0 8 9] [SM 0 9 9] 9]].

Calculate the SM values in the second layer

[SM 0 8 9] = (0 + 8 + 9) % 10 = 17 % 10 = 7

[SM 0 9 9] = (0 + 9 + 9) % 10 = 18 % 10 = 8

[MIN 4 7 2] equals 2.

[SM 8 [MAX 9 3 1] [MAX 9 0 5]] equals [SM 8 9 9] which equals 6 (because 8 + 9 + 9 = 26, and 26 modulo 10 equals 6).

[MAX 0 4 1] = 4.

Inserting these into the expression: 

[SM 1 2 [SM 6 5 3]] [SM 0 4 7] 9.

And continuing:

[SM 6 5 3] = (6+5+3) mod 10 = 4;
[SM 0 4 7] = (0+4+7) mod 10 = 1.

So, 

[SM 1 2 4] [SM 1 9].

Finally:

[SM 1 2 4] = (1+2+4) mod 10 = 7;
[SM 1 9] = (1+9) mod 10 = 0.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's calculate the values inside the innermost brackets:

[SM [MAX 8 4 1] [MAX 6 2 4] 7]: We will start by the MAX value, [MAX 8 4 1] gives the maximum of 8, 4 and 1 which is 8. Similarly [MAX 6 2 4] is 6. So we substitute these values to get [SM 8 6 7], whose SUM modulo 10 is 8+6+7 = 21 (but modulo 10 makes it 1).

Next is [MAX 2 7 6], which is 7, and [SM 3 7 2], whose SUM is 3+7+2 = 12 (but modulo 10 makes it 2), and so the expression [MAX 7, 4, 2] gives the maximum value 7.

Now, the entire expression under the outermost SM operator is thus rewritten as [SM 3 [MAX 1 8 7]], which evaluates to [SM 3 8] (since the MAX of 1, 8, 7 is 8), which is a SUM of 3 + 8 = 11 (but modulo 10 makes it 1).

We then look at the second half of the initial expression:

[MAX 6 [SM 4 8 2] [SM 0 6 0]] - The SUMs are [SM 4 8 2] = 4+8+2 = 14 (but modulo 10 makes it 4), and [SM 0 6 0] = 0+6+0 = 6. So the expression becomes [MAX 6 4 6] and the maximum value is 6.

[MIN 0 3 3] = 0, since 0 is the lowest value.

[MAX 9 9 7] = 9, since 9 is the highest value.

Thus, [MIN 5 0 9] = 0, since 0 is the lowest value.

So, finally [MIN 9 6 0] = 0, since 0 is the lowest value.

So the final answer to the entire original expression is [SM 1 0], which simplifies to 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, the answer to the original expression is 1.",1,1

- [MAX 7 4 0] 
- [MIN [MIN 1 4 3] [MIN 9 2 3] 1]

- [MAX 8 0 4] = 8
- [MAX 9 2 1] = 9
- [MAX 0 5 1] = 5

- [MAX 7 4 0] 
- [MIN [MIN 1 4 3] [MIN 9 2 3] 1]

- [MAX [MAX 4 3 4] [MAX 4 6 4] 6] is equal to [MAX 4 6 6] = 6

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the MINs and MAXes in the expression. 

The [MAX 5 6 1] is 6. 
The [MAX 9 4 7] is 9. 
The [MIN 5 5 5] is 5. 
The [MAX 6 9 2] is 9. 
The [SM 9 8 3] is 0 because 9+8+3=20, but modulo 10, that's 0. 
So, [MAX 0 0 5] is 5. 
The [MIN 3 0 1] is 0. 
The [MAX 8 7 5] is 8. 
The [MIN 6 1 6] is 1. 
The [SM 9 9 8] is 6 because 9+9+8=26, but modulo 10, that's 6.

Now the expression becomes:

[MIN 9 [MAX 9 5] [SM [SM 0 0 8] [SM 1 6 7] 5]]

This simplifies to:

[MIN 9 9 [SM 8 [SM 1 3 5]]]

because [SM 0 0 8] is 8 and [SM 1 6 7] is 4 (because 1+6+7=14, but modulo 10, that's 4). 

Next it simplifies to:

[MIN 9 9 [SM 8 9]]

SM 8 9 is 7 because 8 + 9 = 17, but modulo 10, that's 7.

[SM [MAX [SM 8 0 4] 0 [SM 2 0 1]] [SM 6 [SM 0 9 0] [MAX 9 5 1]]] 2

Let's continue solving:

SM 8 0 4 = (8 + 0 + 4) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2
MAX 2 0 1 = 2 (since 2 is the maximum among 2, 0, and 1)
SM 0 9 0 = (0 + 9 + 0) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9
MAX 9 5 1 = 9 (since 9 is the maximum among 9, 5, and 1)

Our updated expression is:

[SM 3 4 4] equals 11 modulo 10 is 1,
[MAX 4 7 1] equals 7,
[MIN [SM 3 4 4] [MAX 4 7 1] 3] becomes [MIN 1 7 3], which equals 1,
So, [MAX 0 [MIN [MIN [SM 9 4 0] [MAX 6 4 3] 3] [MIN [SM 3 4 4] [MAX 4 7 1] 3] 4] is [MAX 0 [MIN 3 1 4]] which equals [MAX 0 1] equals 1.

Then:
[MAX 1 0 4] equals 4,
[MIN 7 4 9] equals 4, 
[SM [MAX 1 0 4] [MIN 7 4 9] 6] becomes [SM 4 4 6], which equals 14 modulo 10 is 4,
[MAX 0 4 2] equals 4,
[MAX 6 4 5] equals 6,
[MAX [MAX 0 4 2] [MAX 6 4 5] 2] becomes [MAX 4 6 2], which equals 6,
[SM [SM [MAX 1 0 4] [MIN 7 4 9] 6] [MAX [MAX 0 4 2] [MAX 6 4 5] 2] 8] becomes [SM 4 6 8], which equals 18 modulo 10 gives 8.
Finally, [MAX 1 8] equals 8.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the values inside the SM (sum modulo 10):

SM 6 9 4 = (6 + 9 + 4) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
SM 1 0 8 = (1 + 0 + 8) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9
SM 4 8 3 = (4 + 8 + 3) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5
SM 2 0 3 = (2 + 0 + 3) mod 10 = 5 mod 10 = 5
SM 4 9 2 = (4 + 9 + 2) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5

Then we substitute them back into the expression and solve the MIN and MAX operators:

MAX [MAX 3 [MIN 5 9 9] [MAX 5 [MAX 1 1 0] 4]] [MAX [MIN 1 [MIN 4 2 8] 5] 5 [MIN 4 5 [MAX 6 2 7]]] 0

Which simplifies to:

MAX [MAX 3 5 [MAX 5 1 4]] [MAX 1 5 [MIN 4 5 7]] 0 

Then it further simplifies to:

MAX 5 4 0 

And the final result is the maximum value of 5, 4 and 0, which is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we evaluate the highest-precedence (innermost) operators:
- [MAX 0 3 7] = 7, because 7 is the highest number in the list.
- [MIN 7 7 0] = 0, because 0 is the lowest number in the list.
- [MIN 0 2 7] = 0, because 0 is the lowest number in the list.
- [MAX 2 8 0] = 8, because 8 is the highest number in the list.
- [SM 1 7 3] = (1 + 7 + 3) modulo 10 = 11 modulo 10 = 1, because the sum of the numbers is 11, and 11 modulo 10 equals 1.
- [MIN 0 5 9] = 0, because 0 is the lowest number in the list.
- [MIN 5 4 4] = 4, because 4 is the lowest number in the list.
- [MAX 6 6 6] = 6, because 6 is the highest number in the list.

Replacing these into the original expression gives us:
[MIN [SM 9 [MIN 9 7 0] [MIN 0 6 8]] [MAX [SM 1 0 6] 1 [MAX 4 7 6]]] 6.

There are now more operators to evaluate:
- [MIN 9 7 0] = 0, because 0 is the lowest number in the list.
- [MIN 0 6 8] = 0, because 0 is the lowest number in the list.
- [SM 1 0 6] = (1 + 0 + 6) modulo 10 = 7 modulo 10 = 7, because the sum of the numbers is 7, and 7 modulo 10 equals 7.
- [MAX 4 7 6] = 7, because 7 is the highest number in the list.

Replacing this into our expression leaves us with:
[MIN [SM 9 0 0] [MAX 7 1 7]] 6.

Evaluating this gives:
- [SM 9 0 0] = (9 + 0 + 0) modulo 10 = 9, because 9 modulo 10 equals 9.
- [MAX 7 1 7] = 7, because 7 is the highest number in the list.

Replacing this into our express leaves us with:
[MIN 9 7] 6.

The 'MIN' operator selects the minimum number:
- [MIN 9 7] = 7, because 7 is smaller than 9.

Finally, we compare this with 6:
- [MIN 7 6] = 6, because 6 is smaller than 7. 

So, the evaluation of the given expression is 6.",6,6

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to resolve the innermost brackets, which are [SM 1 7 1], [MIN 3 3 3],  [MIN 2 0 6], [MIN 0 9 9] , [MAX 1 0 7] , [MAX 5 5 9] , [SM 7 8 3] , [SM 0 9 2]

For [SM 1 7 1], we calculate 1 + 7 + 1 = 9

For [MIN 3 3 3], the smallest number is 3

For [MIN 2 0 6], the smallest number is 0

For [MIN 0 9 9], the smallest number is 0

For [MAX 1 0 7], the largest number is 7

For [MAX 5 5 9], the largest number is 9

For [SM 7 8 3], we calculate 7 + 8 + 3 = 18 modulo 10 = 8

For [SM 0 9 2], we calculate 0 + 9 + 2 = 11 modulo 10 = 1

Then, we replace those values in the original expression and we get: 
[MAX 9 [MIN 9 9 3] 6 [SM 0 0 1]] [MAX [SM 7 9 3] 5 [MAX 8 8 1]]

Second, we need to resolve the brackets [MIN 9 9 3] and [SM 7 9 3], thus,
For [MIN 9 9 3], the smallest number is 3

For [SM 7 9 3], we calculate 7 + 9 + 3 = 19 modulo 10 = 9

Replacing the above values in the previous expression, we get:
[MAX 9 3 6 1] [MAX 9 5 8 1]

Finally, let's find out the maximum values in each of the brackets and 
For [MAX 9 3 6 1], the largest number is 9

For [MAX 9 5 8 1], the largest number is 9 

Therefore, the final outcome is 9.",9,9
