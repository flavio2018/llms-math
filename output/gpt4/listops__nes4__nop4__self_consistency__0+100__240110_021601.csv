- [MIN 2 2 7 3] is 2
- [MIN [SM 4 2 7 6] 4 [SM 2 3 1 0] 8] is 4, because [SM 4 2 7 6] is 9 (since 4 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 19 and 19 modulo 10 is 9) and [SM 2 3 1 0] is 6
- [MIN 2 8 5 1] is 1
- [SM 1 [MAX 6 5 8 7] [SM 7 0 1 6] 4] is 1, because [MAX 6 5 8 7] is 8 and [SM 7 0 1 6] is 4, so the total is (1 + 8 + 4) modulo 10 which gives us 3, but this is greater than 1

In the next operation, [SM 0 6 1 9], the sum of 0, 6, 1, and 9 is 16. Since we are only interested in the single-digit answer, we take the modulus by 10, which gives us 6.

Then, [MIN 3 [SM 8 9 4 0] 1 [MIN 9 7 9 4]]. For [SM 8 9 4 0], the sum is 21, modulus 10, which gives us 1. For [MIN 9 7 9 4], the minimum is 4. So, the final expression turns into [MIN 3 1 1 4], in which the minimum number is 1.

Now, operate on the innermost fully enclosed brackets using the [SM ...] operator. Starting with [SM 5 2 0 7], we get 14 but as we are doing modulo 10, it becomes 4. Now, substitute the value back to the expression, so it becomes: 

[MIN 1 [SM 4 5 [MIN 4 9 1 9] 0] 6 [MIN [SM 3 5 0 8] 5 5 4]].

Doing it for [SM 3 5 0 8], we get 16 but as we are doing modulo 10, it becomes 6. Substituting that value, the expression now becomes: 

[MIN 1 [SM 4 5 [MIN 4 9 1 9] 0] 6 [MIN 6 5 5 4]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the expressions one by one. Begin with the most inside square brackets and then move on to outer ones.
Let's start with [MIN 1 5 8 9]. The minimum of these four numbers is 1, so this entire expression simplifies down to 1.
Do the same for [MIN 1 3 6 3]. This simplifies down to 1.
Same for [MIN 5 0 0 9]. It simplifies to 0.
And [MIN 5 5 8 7] simplifies to 5.
[MIN 5 9 9 1] simplifies to 1.
Our expression now is:
[MAX 1 4 [SM 6 [MIN 1 3 7 [SM 2 8 9 8]] [MAX 8 1 9 0] 7] [SM 2 [MAX [MIN 1 7 0 9] 8 5 0] 0 [SM 1 [SM 4 3 2 5] 8 9]]].

Then proceed forward on the SM's and MIN's:
[MIN 1 3 7 [SM 2 8 9 8]] simplifies to 1 (after calculating SM). 
[MAX 8 1 9 0] simplifies to 9.
[MIN 1 7 0 9] simplifies to 0.
And then [SM 4 3 2 5] simplifies to 4 (14 MOD 10 = 4).
Our expression now is:
[MAX 1 4 1 9 7] [SM 2 [MAX 0 8 5 0] 0 [SM 1 4 8 9]].

Next, let's tackle the next MAX.
[MAX 0 8 5 0] simplifies to 8.
The expression now is:
[MAX 1 4 1 9 7] [SM 2 8 0 [SM 1 4 8 9]].

Calculate the next SM:
[SM 1 4 8 9] simplifies to 2 (22 MOD 10)
After this, our expression will look like this:
[MAX 1 4 1 9 7] [SM 2 8 0 2].

Calculate the next SM which is [SM 2 8 0 2] simplifies to 2 (12 MOD 10)
The expression now is:
[MAX 1 4 1 9 7] 2.

Finally, we calculate the MAX.
[MAX 1 4 1 9 7] simplifies to 9.

- [MIN 4 4 8] = 4
- [MAX 4 9] = 9

SM [21 2] = SM [23]
SM [1 2 6 9 1] = SM [19]

[MAX 5 7] = 7
[MAX 9 9 0 8] = 9
[MAX 5 3 3 0] = 5

[SM 7 0 8 4] = 9 (19 modulo 10 is 9)
[SM 3 9 1 6] = 9 (19 modulo 10 is 9)

The expression now becomes:

Next, find the smallest number in [8,9,6,8,2,0,5] -> 0.

The sum of the numbers in [6,2,1,9] is 18, but we need to take it modulo 10 which gives us 8, and the sum of numbers in [1,3,9,3] modulo 10 gives 6.

[SM 4 9 0 4] = (4+9+0+4)mod10 = 17mod10 = 7, because the remainder after dividing the sum 17 by 10 equals 7.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's find the results of all MAX operations. We have the following:

- [MAX 4 2 4 8] - Here, the maximum number is 8.
- [MAX 4 0 2 9] - Here, the maximum number is 9.
- [MAX 9 6 2 8] - Here, the maximum number is 9.
- [MAX 0 9 4 5] - Here, the maximum number is 9.

Then, we rewrite our original expression by replacing the MAX operations with their results:

Next, we will calculate the MIN operations:

- [MIN 8 8 9 8] - Here, the minimum number is 8.
- [MIN 9 8 4 [MIN 6 1 6 3]] - In [MIN 6 1 6 3], the minimum number is 1. Replacing [MIN 6 1 6 3] with 1, then [MIN 9 8 4 1], the minimum number is 1.
- [MIN 6 5 [SM 5 7 8 8] [SM 4 7 7 5]] - We'll solve the nested sums first and then come back to this. 

Now, the expression is:

[SM [MIN 8 3 8 1] 3 [MAX 2 6 [MIN 6 5 ? ?] ?] 5].

- [SM 4 7 7 5] - Here, the sum modulo 10 is (4+7+7+5)%10 = 23%10 = 3.
- [SM 9 0 9 9] - Here, the sum modulo 10 is (9+0+9+9)%10 = 27%10 = 7.

Now, back to the previous MIN operation:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the expression inside SM and MIN.

SM [9 1 4 3] = (9+1+4+3) % 10 = 17 % 10 = 7.
Since the second part of SM operator has only one value, the result will be that value: SM [7 1 7] = 7.

MIN [7 1 4 9] = 1, and MIN [7 5 2 2] = 2. Therefore, SM [8 7 5 8] = (8+7+5+8) % 10 = 28 % 10 = 8. 

Next, we replace the values we found in the initial expression: MAX [MIN 1 7 1 1 [SM 8 8 1]] 0 [MIN 3 [SM [MAX 6 7 0 0] 5 [SM 4 3 1 8] 8] 5 [MIN 8 [SM 5 8 8 8] 3 [MAX 1 4 1 1]]] 7.

- MAX 3 8 7 8 = 8
- MAX 9 9 4 9 = 9
- MAX 3 3 2 4 = 4  

After substituting these into the expression we get:

Again, let's compute the MAX and MIN operators:

- SM 0 6 9 5 = (0+6+9+5 modulo 10) = 20 mod 10 = 0
- MIN 6 0 2 0 = 0
- MIN 6 8 5 9 = 5
- SM 0 4 7 2 = (0+4+7+2 modulo 10) = 13 mod 10 = 3

So, the operation is now:

- [MIN 2 2 7 4] = 2 and [SM 5 3 8 6] = (5+3+8+6) mod 10 = 2. Then [MIN 3 0 2 2] = 0.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the inside brackets and then move to outer brackets.

Starting with:

2. [MAX 4 1 1 3] = 4
3. [SM 8 2 9 1] = 20 % 10 = 0
4. [MAX 4 6 8 7] = 8
5. [SM 0 5 2 0] = 7 % 10 = 7
6. [MAX 4 9 1 5] = 9
7. [SM 5 0 7 8] = 20 % 10 = 0 

Now, substitute these values into the original equation:

9. [SM 0 2 2 8] = 2
10. [MIN 2 7 7 9] = 2
11. [MIN 3 0 9 9] = 0

Substitute these values into the equation:

Continue:

12. [MIN 0 4 2 2] = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First step, we find the maximum or minimum numbers in the lists within the brackets:
    The max of [MAX 1 0 0 5] is 5, the min of [MIN 8 4 4 0] is 0, the min of [MIN 3 [SM 3 4 9 0] [SM 9 4 2 5] 4] needs more simplification, [SM 3 4 9 0] is (3 + 4 + 9 +0) modulo 10 = 16 modulo 10 = 6 and [SM 9 4 2 5] is (9 + 4 + 2 +5) modulo 10 = 20 modulo 10 = 0. So, the min of [MIN 3 6 0 4] is 0.
    
    The max of [MAX 1 8 5 5] is 8, the max of [MAX 8 6 4 5] is 8, the min of [MIN 6 3 7 4] is 3, and the min of [MIN [MAX 1 8 1 5] 8 9 [MAX 8 6 4 5]] needs more simplification. The max of [MAX 1 8 1 5] is 8, so the min of [MIN 8 8 9 8] is 8.

2. [MAX 7 8 0 5] equals 8.
3. [SM 1 0 2 8] equals 1 (because the sum is 11, we take the modulo 10).
4. [MAX 9 8 8 0] equals 9.
5. [SM 5 8 4 6] equals 3 (because the sum is 23, we take the modulo 10).
6. [SM 2 7 6 0] equals 5 (because the sum is 15, we take the modulo 10).
7. [MIN 8 8 5 8] equals 5.
8. [SM [MIN 8 8 5 8] 4 7 [MIN 6 4 1 5]] equals 1 (because [SM 5 4 7 1] equals 17, we take the modulo 10).

So, the main expression becomes:

[MIN 4 [SM 3 [MAX 9 8 9 3] 6 [MAX 9 6 6 1]] 7 [MAX [MAX 8 3 3 5] 2 1 5]].

Next, we simplify the expressions in the above expression:

[MAX 2 8 6 3] = 8

[SM 6 3 8 7] = (6 + 3 + 8 + 7) modulo 10 = 24 modulo 10 = 4

[MAX 4 0 5 0] = 5

[MAX 1 2 8 4] = 8

The updated expression becomes:

Completing the inner SM operation:

[SM 3 9 9 3] = (3 + 9 + 9 + 3) modulo 10 = 24 modulo 10 = 4

   [MIN 0 3 6 3] resolves to 0
    
   [MIN 8 5 5 3] resolves to 3

2. The part [MIN 5 [MAX 0 8 3 1]] is now

   [MIN 5 [MAX 0 8 3 1]] becomes [MIN 5 [MAX 0 8 3 1]]

   resolving [MAX 0 8 3 1] gives 8 

   making the part [MIN 5 8] which results in 5. 

3. Resolve [MIN 5 1 5 5] which is 1 and [MAX 3 8 2 5] which is 8. So

   [MIN 6 4 [MIN 5 1 5 5] [MAX 3 8 2 5]] now is [MIN 6 4 1 8]

6. Continue with the rest of the expression. Innermost expressions again comes first.

   [MIN 3 2 6 7] is 2
   
   [SM 1 4 8 3] is 6 because of modulo 10

7. Now, [MAX [MIN 3 2 6 7] 0 [SM 1 4 8 3] 3] is [MAX 2 0 6 3] which is 6.

8. Resolve [MAX 5 7 6 3] which is 7 and [SM 2 8 5 9] is 4 because of modulo 10.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let us solve the inner most expressions. In the expression [MAX 3 8 2 9] maximum integer is 9. Now the expression looks like: 
[SM 6 [MIN 1 [MIN 1 9] 2 [MIN 2 4 3 9]] [SM [SM 5 9 7 8] 4 2 [MIN 2 7 0 6]] 3] [MAX [SM [SM 7 5 7 6] 0 [MIN 1 2 0 7] 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Next, in the expression [MIN 1 9] the minimum integer is 1. The expression now looks like: 
[SM 6 [MIN 1 1 2 [MIN 2 4 3 9]] [SM [SM 5 9 7 8] 4 2 [MIN 2 7 0 6]] 3] [MAX [SM [SM 7 5 7 6] 0 [MIN 1 2 0 7] 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

In the expression [MIN 1 1 2 [MIN 2 4 3 9]], the minimum integer is 1. Now the expression becomes:
[SM 6 1 [SM [SM 5 9 7 8] 4 2 [MIN 2 7 0 6]] 3] [MAX [SM [SM 7 5 7 6] 0 [MIN 1 2 0 7] 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Continue to solve [SM 5 9 7 8], which is (5+9+7+8) modulo 10 = 29 modulo 10 = 9.
The expression now looks like:
[SM 6 1 [SM 9 4 2 [MIN 2 7 0 6]] 3] [MAX [SM [SM 7 5 7 6] 0 [MIN 1 2 0 7] 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

In the expression [MIN 2 7 0 6], the minimum integer is 0. Now the expression becomes:
[SM 6 1 [SM 9 4 2 0] 3] [MAX [SM [SM 7 5 7 6] 0 [MIN 1 2 0 7] 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Solving [SM 9 4 2 0] which is (9+4+2+0) modulo 10 = 15 modulo 10 = 5.
The partially revised expression is now:
[SM 6 1 5 3] [MAX [SM [SM 7 5 7 6] 0 [MIN 1 2 0 7] 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Next, solve [SM 7 5 7 6] which is (7+5+7+6) modulo 10 = 25 modulo 10 = 5.
The expression now looks like:
[SM 6 1 5 3] [MAX [SM 5 0 [MIN 1 2 0 7] 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Then, we solve [MIN 1 2 0 7] which is 0. The expression now becomes:
[SM 6 1 5 3] [MAX [SM 5 0 0 1] 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Solving [SM 5 0 0 1] which is (5+0+0+1) modulo 10 = 6 modulo 10 = 6. The expression becomes:
[SM 6 1 5 3] [MAX 6 4 [MIN 6 [MIN 6 9 5 3] 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Let's solve [MIN 6 9 5 3] which is 3. The expression becomes:
[SM 6 1 5 3] [MAX 6 4 [MIN 6 3 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] 8] 2].

Then, [MIN 6 3 3 [MAX 6 9 0 9]] is 3. Now the expression turns into:
[SM 6 1 5 3] [MAX 6 4 3 8] 2].

Solving [SM 6 1 5 3] is (6+1+5+3) modulo 10 = 15 modulo 10 = 5. Also, [MAX 6 4 3 8] is 8. The expression becomes:
[SM 5 8 2].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, it's essential to understand the operations:
- MAX gives the maximum number in a list
- MIN gives the minimum number in a list
- SM gives the sum of numbers in the list that has been taken modulo 10 (the remainder when the sum is divided by 10)

Now let's break down the given expression:
1. Start with innermost parentheses and replace each with the result of applying its operation:
- [MAX 2 4 6 0] is 6
- [SM 2 1 6 7] is 6 (as sum of 2+1+6+7 is 16 modulo 10 or the remainder when 16 is divided by 10)
- [MIN 4 7 0 6] is 0
- [MAX 0 5 8 6] is 8
- [SM 5 8 5 0] is 8 (as sum of 5+8+5+0 is 18 modulo 10)
- [MIN 4 9 4 6] is 4
- [MIN 8 9 5 0] is 0
- [SM 6 7 4 6] is 3 (as sum of 6+7+4+6 is 23 modulo 10) 

Now replace each parentheses with these results in the expression. So the expression becomes:
- MAX [SM [MIN 6 8 6 5] 4 [MAX 0 8 6 4] 6] 2 9 [MAX 9 [SM 5 0 3 8] 9 [MIN 2 8 4 2]]

Also, note that MAX and MIN take any amount of arguments, but SM only takes four. So when we have four numbers bracketed together, it's clear that that's the SM operation at work. 

Continuing solving the expression:
2. Calculate the next layer of operations:
- [MIN 6 8 6 5] is 5
- [MAX 0 8 6 4] is 8
- [SM 5 0 3 8] is 6 (as sum of 5+0+3+8 is 16 modulo 10)
- [MIN 2 8 4 2] is 2 

After these steps, we obtain 
- MAX [SM 5 4 8 6] 2 9 [MAX 9 6 9 2]

3. Go to the next layer:
- [SM 5 4 8 6] is 3 (as sum of 5+4+8+6 is 23 modulo 10)
- [MAX 9 6 9 2] is 9

Calling these operations results in the final operation:
- MAX 3 2 9 9

The final result of this operation is 9, so that's the result of the whole expression!",9,9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the inside brackets first. 

In [MAX 6 4 0 8], MAX gives the maximum value, which is 8.

In [MIN 1 4 1 5], MIN gives the minimum value, which is 1.

In [SM 2 6 6 8], SM gives the sum of all numbers modulo 10, which is (2+6+6+8) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2.

In [MIN 5 3 8 1], MIN gives the minimum value, which is 1.

So our expression so far is : 
[MAX 6 [MAX 0 8 [MAX 9 8 1 9] [MIN 1 2 1]] 4 [SM [MIN [SM 0 3 6 4] 8 8 [MIN 3 0 8 5]] 1 [SM 4 [MAX 2 0 7 3] [MIN 2 6 5 3] 2] 9]].

Again, for the inside brackets:

In [MAX 9 8 1 9], MAX gives the maximum value, which is 9.

In [MIN 1 2 1], MIN gives the minimum value, which is 1.

So, the expression becomes:
[MAX 6 [MAX 0 8 9 1] 4 [SM [MIN [SM 0 3 6 4] 8 8 [MIN 3 0 8 5]] 1 [SM 4 [MAX 2 0 7 3] [MIN 2 6 5 3] 2] 9]].

In [MAX 0 8 9 1], MAX gives the maximum value, which is 9.

So, the expression updates to:
[MAX 6 9 4 [SM [MIN [SM 0 3 6 4] 8 8 [MIN 3 0 8 5]] 1 [SM 4 [MAX 2 0 7 3] [MIN 2 6 5 3] 2] 9]].

Inside the bracket [MIN [SM 0 3 6 4] 8 8 [MIN 3 0 8 5]]:

[SM 0 3 6 4] gives the sum of all numbers modulo 10, which is (0+3+6+4) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3.

[MIN 3 0 8 5] gives the minimum value, which is 0.

So the expression becomes: 
[MAX 6 9 4 [SM [MIN 3 8 8 0] 1 [SM 4 [MAX 2 0 7 3] [MIN 2 6 5 3] 2] 9]].

Again, for the inside brackets:

In [MIN 3 8 8 0], MIN gives the minimum value, which is 0.

So, the expression becomes:
[MAX 6 9 4 [SM 0 1 [SM 4 [MAX 2 0 7 3] [MIN 2 6 5 3] 2] 9]].

In [MAX 2 0 7 3], MAX gives the maximum value, which is 7.

In [MIN 2 6 5 3], MIN gives the minimum value, which is 2.

So, the expression updates to:
[MAX 6 9 4 [SM 0 1 [SM 4 7 2 2] 9]].

In [SM 4 7 2 2], SM gives the sum of all numbers modulo 10, which is (4+7+2+2) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5.

So, the expression becomes:
[MAX 6 9 4 [SM 0 1 5 9]].

In [SM 0 1 5 9], SM gives the sum of all numbers modulo 10, which is (0+1+5+9) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5.

So, the ultimate expression becomes:
[MAX 6 9 4 5].

Finally, for the main operators:

In [MAX 6 9 4 5], MAX gives the maximum value, which is 9.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify inner brackets:

- In the SM operation, we have another SM function [SM 4 6 4 8] summing up to 22, and the modulo operation gives 2. Also, the MIN function [MIN 3 8 0 8] results in 0. So, the expression simplifies to [SM 4 2 0 4], giving 10, and modulo operation gives 0.

- In another SM operation, there is again a SM function [SM 8 7 3 7] summing up to 25, giving 5. We also have a MIN function [MIN 4 6 7 4] summing up to 21 (2 after modulo operation), and another MIN function [MIN 6 1 0 9] giving 0. The outer SM 0 2 0 summing up to 2.

Now, expression looks like this:

[MIN [MAX 9 0] 4 [SM 5 9 2] 8].

Continuing simplification:

- The MAX 9 0 gives 9.
- The SM 5 9 2 sums up to 16, and modulo operation gives 6.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to solve expressions in inner braces. 

The MAX function returns the maximum value from the list of numbers. That means we have:

MAX 9 2 2 6 = 9 
MAX 7 2 7 8 = 8 

The MIN function returns the minimum value from the list of numbers. That means we have:

MIN 2 9 2 8 = 2 

Now we replace these values in the main expression. We get:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 0 8 9 8] [SM [SM 2 8 7 6] 4 2 3] 6 8] 1 [MIN [MAX 6 [MIN 7 9 2 0] 6 [MIN 5 2 1 7]] 2 [MAX 1 [SM 9 2 4 4] 2 [MAX 4 4 3 5]] 6] 1]

Next, we deal with the SM function which returns the sum of values modulo 10. 

SM 2 8 7 6 = 3 (because 2+8+7+6=23 and 23 modulo 10 equals 3)

SM 9 2 4 4 = 1 (because 9+2+4+4=19 and 19 modulo 10 equals 1)

The updated expression will look like:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 0 8 9 8] [SM 3 4 2 3] 6 8] 1 [MIN [MAX 6 [MIN 7 9 2 0] 6 [MIN 5 2 1 7]] 2 [MAX 1 1 2 [MAX 4 4 3 5]] 6] 1]

Again, we solve the SM which gives us:

SM 3 4 2 3 = 2 (because 3+4+2+3 = 12 and 12 modulo 10 equals 2)

So, we have:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 0 8 9 8] 2 6 8] 1 [MIN [MAX 6 [MIN 7 9 2 0] 6 [MIN 5 2 1 7]] 2 [MAX 1 1 2 [MAX 4 4 3 5]] 6] 1]

Next, we go for the MIN and MAX functions in inner braces which are:

MIN 7 9 2 0 = 0 
MIN 5 2 1 7 = 1 
MAX 4 4 3 5 = 5

After replacing these values we get:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 0 8 9 8] 2 6 8] 1 [MIN [MAX 6 0 6 1] 2 [MAX 1 1 2 5] 6] 1]

Continuing with the most inner MAX and MIN calculations, we get:

MAX 0 8 9 8 = 9 
MAX 6 0 6 1 = 6 
MAX 1 1 2 5 = 5

So:

[MAX [MIN 9 2 6 8] 1 [MIN 6 2 5 6] 1]

We again calculate the MIN, which gives us:

MIN 9 2 6 8 = 2 
MIN 6 2 5 6 = 2

The updated expression is as follows:

[MAX 2 1 2 1]

Finally, we compute the final MAX operation:

MAX 2 1 2 1 = 2 

So, the result of the original function is 2.",2,2
