A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F&T equals to F, because 'AND' operation with False always results in False.
So, the given expression becomes: ((i|(i|F))&(!(F|(((T&T)&T)&(!((!(!T))&(u|(((j|j)&j)|!(F&F)))))))))

2. The 'OR' operation with False doesn't change the other value, so i|F results in i. Our expression is now: ((i|i)&(!(F|(((T&T)&T)&(!((!(!T))&(u|(((j|j)&j)|!(F&F)))))))))

3. The 'OR' operation between identical values results in said value, so i|i is i. Which simplifies our expression further to: (i&(!(F|(((T&T)&T)&(!((!(!T))&(u|(((j|j)&j)|!(F&F)))))))))

4. T&T equals to T, because 'AND' operation with True always results in the other value. The simplified expression now stands like this: (i&(!(F|((T&T)&!(u|(((j|j)&j)|(!F)))))))

5. The 'NOT' operation on True (!T) results in False, and 'NOT' operation on False (!F) equals to True, so !(!T) is T and !F is T, using which, we get: (i&(!(F|((T&T)&!((u|((j|j)&j)|T))))))

6. The 'AND' operation between identical values results in said value, So (T&T) can be written as simply T, and (j|j)&j can be written as j. Now, the expression stands as: (i&(!(F|(T&!(u|j|T))))))

7. The 'OR' operation with True (T) always results in True. Putting this into use, we get a further simplified expression: (i&(!(F|(T&!(T)))))

8. 'AND'ing with the not of something (!T) is always False so T & !T is F, which brings our expression down to: (i&(!(F|F)))

9. 'OR'ing anything with false doesn't change the value, leading us to: (i&(!F))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify some parts due to the laws of logic:

Using the Idempotent laws (P | P = P and P & P = P), 

- (x&((x|(x&x))|x)) simplifies to (x&(x|x)) which equals x.

- (((c&c)|c)|c)|c simplifies to c.

- (F&T) simplifies to F using logic properties since False AND anything is False.

Using the Double Negation law (!(!P) = P), 

- !(!(F)) simplifies to F.

Secondly, using the Identity and Domination law (P | F = P, P & T = P and P & F = F, P | T = T), we can simplify the following:

- F&(!F) simplifies to F since anything AND False gives False.

- ((!F)|T) simplifies to T since anything OR True gives True.

So, the logical expression simplifies to (x|(!F)) which simplifies to (x|T). Using the Domination law, it simplifies to T. 

Therefore, the given logical formula simplifies to the boolean value True.",T,x

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Replace T and F with their boolean equivalents, True and False.
So, the formula becomes:
`!((True|((False|True)|((!False)|((((c&(c&True))|(f&(False|False)))|True)&(!(False&True))))))&(False&(False&True)))`.

2) First, simplify the easy parts:
- `True|anything` is always `True`.
- `False|anyhing` is always `anything`.
- `!False` is `True`.
- `anyhing&False` is always `False`.
- `anyhing&True` is always `anything`.

Apply these, and you get:
`!((True|((True|((True)|((((c&(c))|(f&False))|True)&(!(False))))))&(False&False))`.

3) Next, apply `f&False` is `False` and `c&c` is `c` again:

`!((True|((True|((True)|((((c)|False)|True)&(!(False))))))&(False))`.

4) Continue with simplifying:
- `c|False` is `c`,
- `!False` is `True`.

This gives you:

`!((True|((True|((True)|((c|True)&True))))&False))`.

5) Now using `any_value|True` as `True`, the formula becomes:

`!((True|((True|(True)&True))&False))`.

6) Keep using the rules to further simplify:

`!((True|True)&False)`.

7) And then keep applying the simplifying rules `True|True` is `True` and `True&False` is `False`:

`!False`.

8) Finally, `!False` is equivalent to `True`.

So, the whole complex logic formula simplifies to `True`.",True,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T|T results in True. Therefore, the original formula can be shortened to: 
((T|(T&T))&(T&(T&((!((!(!(!(F&F))))&(!(T&(!(j&F))))))|(!(t|T)))))

2. Since any condition AND True, results in the same condition, we can simplify T&T to T. Also !F is T and F & F is F. Therefore, the formula becomes simpler: 
(T&(T&((!((!(!(!F))))&(!(T&(!(j&F))))))|(!(t|T))))

3. Double negation of F is F. Also, any condition AND False results in False, whereas any condition OR True results in True. The formula can now be reduced to: 
(T&(T&((!(F))&(!F))|T))

4. Not F results in T (since F is False). And T&T results in T. Therefore, the formula can become:
(T&(T&(T&F)|T))

5. Since T & F is F and T OR T is T, we can now simplify the formula to: 
(T&(T&F|T))

6. Then, T & F will be F. So, the formula can be:
(T & F | T)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The expression `!F` denotes ""not False"", so it will always be True (T). 

2. The expression `T|X` is always True for any X because `T|X` means ""True OR X"", so if X is True the result is True and if it's False the result still remains True. The same logic applies for `T|(!F)`. 

3. The statement `X&(T|(!F))` is same as `X&T` as `T|(!F)` is always True and `X&T` is just `X` because ""Anything AND True"" is equal to ""Anything"".

4. `F|(F|(!C&F))` is same as `F|F|(!C&F)`. `F|F` is False and `!C&F` is False unless C is False. So `F|(F|(!C&F))` simplifies to `!C`. But when you consider `F|((F|(!C&F))|T)` the entire statement is always True due to the Or operation with T. 

5. The expression `F&T` is always False because it's ""False AND anything"" which results in False. Therefore, `F&(F|T)` is also False.

6. Similarly `x|F` is just `x` as ""Anything OR False"" equals itself. 

So, looking at all the pieces we've simplified:

`((T|(!F&x))&x)|F)|(T&F)|F` simplifies to 

`(T|x&x)|F|F` simplifies further to 

`(T|x)|F`

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) The negation of True (i.e., !T) is False.
2) The logical 'AND' operation (denoted &) with False makes the whole operation False (i.e., F & X = F for any X).
3) The logical 'OR' operation (denoted |) with False leaves the other operand intact (i.e., F | X = X for any X). 
4) The negation of False (i.e., !F) is True.
5) The logical 'AND' operation with True does not affect the other operand (i.e., X & T = X for any X).

Using 1), we can replace !T by F, so:

Next, using 2), we can simplify:

   b. (u|(j|T)) is always True, because j OR True = True. So, y & True = y. 
   c. (y|F) & y & y & y(= y as per our a) simplifies to y as y AND y = y
   d. Now, this breaks down to (y | y), which is y.
3. F|(!F) - As False OR Not(False) is same as False OR True, which simplifies to True.
4. y & y is y

3. For `(((f|f)&(!F))|f)`:
    - `(f|f)` is `f` per idempotency laws.
    - `(!F)` is `T` per NOT laws.
    - `(f & T)` is `f` per identity laws.
    - `(f|f)` is `f` per idempotency laws.
4. For `(((f|f)&(!F))|f)|F`:
    - Since `((f|f)&(!F))|f` has already been simplified to `f`, this would be `f|F` which is `T` per identity laws.
5. For `((((f|f)&(!F))|f)|F)&(T&...))`:

Secondly, we can simplify the nested statements involving the False value F. We observe 'F&F'. The 'and' operator only yields true when both operands are true. Thus 'F&F' gives 'F'. 'T|F' would yield 'T'. 'F|F' gives 'F'. 'F|T' also yields 'T'. 'S&F' yields 'F'. Thus 's&F' gives 'F'. 

Finally, we observe 'T&F' and 'g|T' in the last nested sub-expression. From these, 'g|T' gives 'T' and 'T&F' yields 'F'.

5. So, (((r&(z|T)|T)) results in T as irrespective of the value of r (True/False) the operation inside parentheses is True.
6. (((x&x)&((x&T)&((x|x)&(F|T))))|T) results in T this is due to (F|T) being True, and anything OR'd with True gives True.

    7) b&F = F => !(b&F) = T
    8) b&b = b
    9) a OR T = T
    10) a AND T = a

Substituting these values in the expression:

((((b&((r&((r&T)|F))|(T&(!F))))&(T|(!F)))|(b&T))|(b&b))

This becomes:

((((b&((r&(r|F))|(T&T))))&T)|(b&T))|b

Simplify r|F to r, and substitute T&T with T:

((b&((r&r)|T))&T)|(b&T)|b

A AND A can be simplified to A. So, r&r becomes r and T AND T becomes T.

((b&(r|T))&T)|(b&T)|b

A OR T is always T:

(b&T&T)|(b&T)|b

Apply AND operation:

(b&T)|(b&T)|b

Simplify the expression:

- ""(F&((T|F)|T))"" is always False since F AND anything is False.
- Hence, ""(F|(F&((T|F)|T)))"" simplifies to ""F"".
- So, ""!(F|(F&((T|F)|T)))"" simplifies to ""!(F)"" which is True.

- ""(v&F)"" is always False since anything AND False is False.
- Hence, ""(j&(v&F))"" simplifies to ""F"".
- So, ""(l|(F|(j&(v&F))))"" simplifies to ""(l|F)"", which is True since anything OR'ed with False is True.


Now replacing these values in the main expression, it becomes:
""((((l&(((w&((T&(T&F))|T))&w)|True))&l)&T)&True)"".

Now, we will simplify the sub-expression ""((T&(T&F))|T)"":
- ""(T&F)"" simplifies to ""F"".
- So, ""(T&(T&F))"" simplifies to ""T&F"" which is False.
- Hence, ""((T&(T&F))|T)"" simplifies to ""F|T"" which is True.

Now replacing this value in the main expression, it becomes:
""((((l&(((w&True)&w)|True))&l)&T)&True)"".

Further simplification would result in:
- ""((w&True)&w)"" simplifies to ""(w&w)"" which is ""w"".
- So, ""(((w&True)&w)|True)"" simplifies to ""(w|True)"" which is True.

Now replacing these values in the main expression, it becomes:
""((((l&True)&l)&T)&True)"".

Then simplifying this would result in:
- ""(l&True)&l"" simplifies to ""l"".

- 'F' is False, and 'F' with '&' in any expression will always give False.
- 'T' is True, and 'T' with '|' in any expression will always give True.

So, let's simplify the formula:

1. From right to left: replace (F&T) with F (because 'F' with '&' in any expression will always give False).
v&(l&((a|F)&F)) = v&(l&F) = v&F = F (again, because 'F' with '&' in any expression will always give False).

2.((j&((j|F)|j))|F) = (j|F) = T (because 'T' with '|' in any expression will always give True).

In the second bracket, since T|T is always True, k becomes irrelevant ,Therefore the firstly inner expression becomes T|(k|T) where k is irrelevant and the expression leads to T. Then T&F becomes False where it's negation will be True. Hence, the second bracket simplifies to F&True which will become False.

2. The (m|T) will always also be true, because logical or again returns true if any one of the operands is true, so we can simplify to (!((((((((t&T))|(!(!F)))&t)&((t|F)&t))&T)&T)&T)|(!((x&x)&F)))).

3. !(!F) is double negation of False, which is false. So we can replace this expression to F. Now, we have (!((((((t&T)|F)&t)&((t|F)&t))&T)&T)|(!((x&x)&F)))).

According to the rules of logic, the conjunction of any value with False gives False, the conjunction of any value with True gives the value itself, the disjunction of any value with False gives the value itself, and the disjunction of any value with True gives True. The negation operators before True and False can be immediately evaluated to False and True respectively. 

So now let's simplify it:

1. First, simplify the negations over constants:
    (!T) = F      
    (!F) = T      

2. Then, simplify the conjunctions/disjunctions where one side is a constant:
    (F&X) = F       - (since False and anything is False)
    (T&X) = X       - (since True and anything is the value itself)
    (F|X) = X       - (since False or anything is the value itself)
    (T|X) = T       - (since True or anything is True)

Apply these to the formula:

    (!(((x|((((k|(F&(!T)))|F)|k)|(!(n&(p&(!(F|T)))))))&T)|((F&(m&F))|T)))

Becomes:

    (!(((x|((((k|F)|F)|k)|(!n)))&T)|T))
    
Again apply the logic rules: (Expression simplifies more)

    (!((x|k|F|!n)&T)|T)
    (!((x|k|!n)&T)|T)
    (!((x|k|!n))|T)
    (!(x|k|!n))
    
Final simplified version of the expression is:
      
    !(x|k|!n)

Here, we assume that 'and', 'or' and 'not' operators are distributive and associative.
The resulting expression will have the same logic values for every possible truth value assignment to the literals as the given formula.",!(x|k|!n),F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) '!T' would always be False, because T itself is True and its negation is always False.

2) 'v|T' would always be True, because 'T' (True) itself makes an OR operation always True.

3) '!(!(v|T))' simplifies to 'T', because double negation cancels out.

4) 'w|w' simplifies to 'w', because any value OR-ed with itself is always that value.

5) '((w|w)&T)' simplifies to 'w', because any value AND-ed with True stays that value.

6) Swapping around, '((T&(F&(r|T)))|F)' simplifies to 'F', because any value AND-ed with False is False and False OR anything is just that value.

7) '((F&F)&F)' simplifies to 'F', because anything AND-ed with False is always False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, simplify innermost brackets where T - true, F - false, | - OR, & - AND, ! - NOT:
    - For any expression ""expression | T"" the result is always T. So we can replace these occurrences:

        ((T | (!(h | T))) = T
        ((u | T) | T) = T

2. Then, simplify the others:
    - ""Expression & T"" = expression. In our case (q&T)&T = q, because the result of q & T is q.
    - ""F | expression"" = expression, but we do not have such in our formula.
    - ""!T"" = F, so we have:

        !(T) = F
        (!(!(F | T)) = F

3. Substitute the simplified parts back into the expression:

    (!(!F & F) & !(F & F))

3. Then, w|(!F) = w|T = T

So, (!((!((s&s)|T))|F)) = F. 

4. Also, (F|((!(F|F))|F))) = F|(T|F) = F|T = T

So, T|(k&F)= T|F = T.

5. Similarly, (F|(u&F)) = F|F = F.

- The expression T|(l|T) simplifies to T since (T|any_value) is always True.
- The expression !((T&T)&(T|T)) is also equals to False, as we are negating True.
- The expression w&(!T) simplifies to False, as we are trying to 'and' something with False.
- The expression ((((((s&s)&s)&s)|(False))&(s&s)) simplifies to False, as there is no way for the expression to be True when there is 'and' with False.
- The expression (T|(True|False)) simplifies to True since T or with anything is always True.
- The expression F&F simplifies to False.
- The expression (True)&(T|(l&F)) simplifies to True because 'and' with True does not change the original value.

2) Again, ""and"" operation with ""false"" gives “false”. Hence, F&(!((T)&F)) = F. Further simplifications lead to:
((s|F)&((((!F)|T)|((F&F)&F))|T)).

3) The (!F) is T, because ""not"" operation negates the logic condition. Similarly, F&F = F. We get the format:
((s|F)&((T|T)|F|T)).

4) Since ""or"" operation with ""true"" gives ""true"", the second part of the formula (T|T|F|T ) simplifies to T. Thus, final simplified form is:

6. Therefore, the expression becomes: T | (((x&T)|T)&x)&F = T | ((x&x)&T)&F = T | (x&T)&F = T | F = T, Because T or anything is always T.

Next, F & T and F | T simplify to False and True, respectively, which further simplify the expression to:

Then, (l | F) simplifies to l, and anything OR-ed with T is T, and anything AND-ed with T remains the same. Also, the negation of a negation is the original value. This simplifies the expression to:
(l & (!F) & s & T).

So, the given formula becomes:

Next, we simplify (s&T) and (s|s). They will be replaced by s and s respectively.
So, the given formula becomes:

((s&(s|s)|(s&s|F))|s)&s)|(T&(F&(T&(g|T))))|(s|F|T).

Following the same logic, now the formula becomes:

((s&s|s|F)|s)&s)|(T&(F&(T&(g|T))))|(s|F|T).

Further (s&s), (s|F) and (T&(g|T)) simplifies to s, s and g respectively:

((s|s|F)|s)&s)|(T&F&(T&g))|(s|F|T).

After further simplification, this turns to:

(s|s)&s)|(T&F&g)|(s|T).

But (s|s), (T&F) and (s|T) become s, F and T respectively. So the formula is simplified to:

s&s|F|T

This can be further simplified to:

1. Any variable OR with itself is equal to the variable itself. Therefore, y|y is simplified to y.

2. Any variable AND with itself is equal to the variable itself. Therefore, y&y is simplified to y.

3. Any variable OR with False is equal to the variable itself. Therefore, l|F is simplified to l.

4. Any variable OR with True is equal to True. Therefore, T|F and b|b are simplified to T and b, respectively.

5. Besides, any variable AND with False is equal to False. Therefore, F&(t&F) and ((b|b)|F)&b are simplified to F and b, respectively.

After the first simplifications, our logic formula becomes:

(y & (y | (l & ((b | (h | T)) | F) & F)))

1. Since anything OR with F (False) is same as the original variable so (h | T) | F becomes T.

2. Anything AND with False is False. Hence, ((b | h | T) | F) & F simplifies to F.

Finally, we get:

y & (y | (l & F))

1. Anything AND with False is False. Hence, l & F becomes F.

The logic formula simplifies to y & (y | F)
