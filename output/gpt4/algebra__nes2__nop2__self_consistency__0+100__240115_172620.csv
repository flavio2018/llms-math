Now, let's combine these two terms:

34*x*y - 28*x*y equals 6*x*y.

To find the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient of each intermediate term, use the formula a mod n, where a is the numerical coefficient and n is the number by which we are dividing (in this case, 100). The modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (this number is called the modulus).

For 34 and -28, the modulo 100 is just the numbers themselves, because they are less than 100. So, 34 mod 100 = 34 and -28 mod 100 = -28.

For 6, the modulo 100 is also 6 itself, because it is less than 100. So, 6 mod 100 = 6.

((+37*y+74*y)+(+94*y+64*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the problem asks you to add together y collectively, grouped as:

+37*y + 74*y = 111*y

and 

+94*y + 64*y = 158*y

Then, 

111*y + 158*y = 269*y

Finally, we take the numerical coefficient (269) modulo 100.

269 mod 100 = 69

So the final result is 69*y.",69*y,+69*y

((-7*a*b*x*y-60*a*b*x*y)+(-46*a*b*x*y-30*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify this expression within each pair of parentheses:

-7*a*b*x*y - 60*a*b*x*y equals -67*a*b*x*y
-46*a*b*x*y - 30*a*b*x*y equals -76*a*b*x*y

So our expression becomes:
(-67*a*b*x*y) + (-76*a*b*x*y)

Since we are adding two similar terms, we can combine them:
=-143*a*b*x*y

Now, we are asked to compute the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative. 

The numerical coefficient of the term is -143, which is negative. Therefore, we need to find the modulo -100 of -143, which is -43. Thus, the finalized expression is -43*a*b*x*y.",-43*a*b*x*y.,-43*a*b*x*y
99,algebra,self_consistency,((+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y)+(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y)),"Q: Simplify the following algebraic expression, computing the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient of each intermediate value if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative:
((+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y)+(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the expressions within the parentheses:

- (+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y) becomes -90*a*b*x*y. As in the question, we need to compute the modulo -100 of the numerical coefficient. So, we have (-90 modulo -100 = -90)*a*b*x*y = -90*a*b*x*y.

- (+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y) becomes +30*a*b*x*y.

Second, we add these two results together: -90*a*b*x*y + 30*a*b*x*y = -60*a*b*x*y.

Therefore, ((+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y)+(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y)) simplifies to -60*a*b*x*y.",-60*a*b*x*y.,-60*a*b*x*y
