97,algebra,self_consistency,((+37*y+74*y)+(+94*y+64*y)),"Q: Simplify the following algebraic expression, computing the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient of each intermediate value if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative:
((+37*y+74*y)+(+94*y+64*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, add the like terms:

- 37*y and 74*y together: 37*y + 74*y = 111*y
- and 94*y and 64*y together: 94*y + 64*y = 158*y

This makes our expression equal to 111*y + 158*y.

Now, add 111*y and 158*y together to get the final result:

111*y + 158*y = 269*y

Now, the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient (which is 269) is equal to 69. Therefore, our expression simplifies to:

69*y.",69*y.,+69*y
98,algebra,self_consistency,((-7*a*b*x*y-60*a*b*x*y)+(-46*a*b*x*y-30*a*b*x*y)),"Q: Simplify the following algebraic expression, computing the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient of each intermediate value if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative:
((-7*a*b*x*y-60*a*b*x*y)+(-46*a*b*x*y-30*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's group the same terms:

((-7*a*b*x*y - 60*a*b*x*y) + (-46*a*b*x*y - 30*a*b*x*y)) = -(7*a*b*x*y) - 60*a*b*x*y - 46*a*b*x*y - 30*a*b*x*y

So now we have four terms, all with the factor a*b*x*y. We can simplify this by adding the numerical coefficients:

-7 - 60 - 46 - 30 = -143

So, the expression simplifies to -143*a*b*x*y.

Now, we need to compute the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient -143. The modulo operation returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another (called the divisor).

So,

-143 mod -100 = -43.

Thus, the simplified form of given algebraic expression is -43*a*b*x*y.",-43*a*b*x*y,-43*a*b*x*y

((+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y)+(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we combine like terms inside the parentheses:
5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y = -90*a*b*x*y
78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y = 30*a*b*x*y

Then, we add these results:
-90*a*b*x*y+30*a*b*x*y = -60*a*b*x*y

Now, computing the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient:
-60 modulo -100 = -60 So, the final answer is -60*a*b*x*y.",-60*a*b*x*y.,-60*a*b*x*y
