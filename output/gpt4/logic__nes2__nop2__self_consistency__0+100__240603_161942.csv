((i&T)&(T|F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we understand that ""T|F"" is the logical OR between True and False. In an OR operation, if any of the inputs is True then the output is True. So, ""T|F"" simplifies as True (or T).

Substituting this back in the equation,

((i&T)&(T)).

Next, let's focus on the term ""(T)"". In an AND operation, the output is True only if all inputs are True. Thus, if one of the inputs is True (or T), it doesn't affect the result. It still depends on the other input. Hence, ""(T)"" can be removed without changing the result.

So, the simplified formula is:
