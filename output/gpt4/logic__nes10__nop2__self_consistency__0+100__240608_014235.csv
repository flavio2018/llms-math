2) i|F simplifies to i since OR operation with False does not change the value.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (x&x) = x, (c&c) = c. Also, (F&T) = F, because false AND true is always false. 

2. It simplifies the formula to: (x&((x|x)|x))&x)|!(!(F&!(c|c|c|c|((!F)|T))))

3. (x|x) = x, (c|c) = c. Also, (!F) = T, makes T|T = T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, any statement AND'ed with False is always False, and any statement OR'ed with False remains unaffected. Hence, any operation ""(u&F)"" and ""(sth|F)"" can be simplified to ""F"" and ""sth"" respectively.

2. Also, any statement OR'ed with True is always True. So, ""(sth|T)"" can be rewritten as ""T"".

3. To simplify this, let's evaluate the innermost parts first and follow the order of operations.

Now let’s begin simplifying:

((z&((F|(((T&(((s|s)|s)&F))|F)&T))|F))|(T&(T&((!(w|(s|(T|((u&F)|F)))))|F))))

The clause “u&F” simplifies to F, as stated earlier. So, the clause becomes:

((z&((F|(((T&(((s|s)|s)&F))|F)&T))|F))|(T&(T&((!(w|(s|(T|F))))|F)))

The clause ""s|s"" simplifies to ""s"". The whole clause becomes:

((z&((F|(((T&(s&F))|F)&T))|F))|(T&(T&((!(w|s|T))|F))))

The clause ""s&F"" simplifies to F, and ”sth|F” simplifies to sth. So, the clause becomes:

((z&((F|((T&F)&T))|F))|(T&(T&((!(w|s|T))|F))))

The clause ""T&F"" simplifies to F. So, the clause becomes:

((z&((F|F)&T)|(T&(T&(!(w|s|T)|F)))))

The clause ""(F|F)&T"" simplifies to ""F & T"" and then simplifies to ""F"". So, the clause becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) In the sub-expression (!((!T)|T)&F), (!T) is False and T is True, therefore (!T)|T is always True because it's an OR operation (i.e., if either of the conditions are true, the whole expression becomes true). So you are left with True & F which gives False (since AND operation requires both conditions to be True in order to produce True)
2) So the rightmost parenthesis is simply False, and you are left with (((((((((l&l)|(l&T))|l)|F)&(l|(l|(F&F))))|T)|F)&T)|False), which simplifies to  (((((((((l&l)|(l&T))|l)|F)&(l|(l|(F&F))))|T)|F)&T)
3) BUT, since there is an OR operation with True, that makes the whole statement True. As per OR operation, if even one condition is True, the whole expression becomes True. So, regardless of the rest of the complex expression, the presence of the T (True) makes the entire complex expression True.

So the answer is T, that is True.",T,F

(F&F) is F,

2. Now, substitute those values back to the original expression:

3. Simplify further using the rules from above:

(T&(m&T)) simplifies to (m&T),
(T&((m&T)&F)) simplifies to F,
q&T simplifies to T only if q is T, else it simplifies to F.

4. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:

- n or F simplify to n.

- (p & p & T) or T simplify to T.

- !T simplify to F

- F and F simplify to F

- Then, F & T which will simplify to F. 

2. Substituting these into the original expression, we get:

The expression becomes:
T&((d&(F|((p&(p|F))&(F&(T&a)&F))))&(d&F)).

Step 4:
(p|F) = p, and (T&a) = a
Because anything OR'd with False retains the original value, and anything AND'd with True retains the original value.

The expression becomes:
T&((d&(F|(p&p)&(F&a&F)))&(d&F)).

Step 5:
(p&p) = p, and (a&F) = F
Because anything AND'd with itself retains the original value, and anything AND'd with False is False.

The expression becomes:
T&((d&F)&(d&F)).

Step 6:
(d&F) = F
Because anything AND'd with False is False.

The final simplified expression is:

- Anything AND False (A&F) is always False.
- Anything OR True (A|T) is always True.
- NOT True (!T) is False, and NOT False (!F) is True.

We will use these rules to simplify the logic formula:

1. (((i&((h&F)&(((((T|F)|((T|F)&(T&T)))&T)&F)|((T|(F&F))|F))))&F)&((T|(F|F))&F))

According to the above rules: 
- h&F will be always F,
- (T|F) is always T,
- (T|F)&(T&T) is T&T which is T,
- T&F is always F,
- T|(F&F) is always T,
- F|F is always F,
- So (T|F) are T.

Let's simplify:

Re-write the formula:
3. (((i&((F)&(((((T)|T)&T)&F)|(T))))&F)&((T|F)&F))

Because F&T is always F and F|T is always T, simplify:
4. (((i&(F&F|T))&F)&F)

F&F is still F and F|T is always T:
5. (((i&T)&F)&F)

i&T is either T if i is T or F if i is F. Whatever the result, it will be F when AND with F:

Applying these laws, we get:

- The first part (T & F) becomes F.
- (F & (T & (T | F) | T)) is equal to F, as there's an 'F &' which results in F.
- (y | (!F)) is simply (y | T), which results in T.
- (F & (T| (!(h | (T | F) | F)) & F)) again, since there's an 'F &' in the expression, it results in F.

'!F' equals T, because not False is True. '!T' equals F, because not True is False. So we can simplify that:

'(F|F)' is F and '(T&F)' is F because for logical AND both must be true and for logical OR at least one must be true. So we simplify:

Next, F|(F&((T|F)|T)) simplifies to F because F&((T|F)|T) is F, as anything and with False is false.

!(F|(F&((T|F)|T))) then simplifies to T, because the not operation flips the value of F.

So, the overall term (((w&((T&(T&F))|T))&w)|(!(F|(F&((T|F)|T))))) is equal to ((F&w)|T) which simplifies to ((F)|T) which simplifies to T.

Simplifying the last part (((w&((T&(T&F))|T))&w)|(!(F|(F&((T|F)|T))))))&l) simplifies to (T)&l, which is just l.

Also, 'x' & T always equals 'x' because ""x and True"" equals 'x'. So, (a | F) & (F & T) = a & F = F 
Then, we know that F | x equals x, so j | F | j = j.
And 'x' & 'x' equals 'x', so j | F | j equals j.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting from the innermost operations:

1. `T|F` is equal to True, or `T` (since this is an OR logical operation and True OR anything is always True).
2. `(T|F)&F` is equal to False, or `F` because True AND False is always False.
3. That makes `h|((T|F)&F)` equal to `h|F` which simplifies further to `h` (h OR False is simply h).
4. Again `h & h` also gives `h`.
 
5. Similarly, `F|F` is equal to False, or `F` (OR operation between two false is false).
6. `T & F` is equal to False, or `F` (AND operation between True and False is false).
7. Hence `(T&(F|F))|(y|(s|T))|(F|F)` simplifies to `F|T` which in turn is simply `T`.
8. The expression `(T & F)` results into `F`.
9. So, `T & ((h|((((T&(F|F))|(y|(s|T)))|(F|F))&F))&h)` is actually `h`, with the internal parts all simplifying down to True and then negated with False, leaving `h`.

2. Same as point 1, e|(e|F) will be simplified to e.

3. Any value OR with True will always return True. So, the simplified form of (F|((e|(e|F))|T)) becomes True because (F|(e|T)) is True.

4. (!True) will return False, so the simplified form of (!((F|((e|(e|F))|T)) is False.

5. Discussing (((s&F)&T)&T), any value AND with False will return False. This simplifies (((s&F)&T)&T) to False.

6. Now, any value AND with False will return False. Thus, the simplified form of (F&(((s&F)&T)&T)) is False.

7. Going forward, any value OR with False will return the value itself. So, ((((g|g)|g)&T)|F)&(F&(((s&F)&T)&T)) simplifies to ((((g|g)|g)&T).
   
8. Any value OR with itself returns the same value. Therefore, ((((g|g)|g)&T) simplifies to (g&T).

2. The expression ""!(!F)"" means ""not not false"" which becomes ""false"". Similarly, the formula ""x & F"" is equivalent to  ""F"", as anything anded with 'false' gives 'false'.

3. Now eliminate F&!T which becomes F, and p&!T becomes p (because !T is false and n and p ANDing with false would give false, and false ANDing with any term gives false) and F&(m&F)) is F.
4. So, your formula becomes : (!(((x|((((k|F)|F)|k)|(!n&p)))&T)|T)).
5. Again, k|F, F|F gives k and F respectively, So, the formula now is  : (!(((x|((k|F)|k)|(!n&p))&T)|T)).
6. k|F gives k, So the formula becomes :  (!(((x|(k|k)|(!n&p))&T)|T)).
7. k|k results in k. Hence, the formula becomes:  (!(x|k|(!n&p)&T)|T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, F | ((!(F|F)) | F), will simplify to F because a logical OR between false values will always give a false output and if there's a NOT operator outside, it becomes NOT(FALSE) i.e TRUE and TRUE OR FALSE is TRUE which is then AND with F becoming F. And K AND F is false. So let's simplify it:

T | ((k & F) & F)) will become T because anything AND with false is false. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to T.

Similarly, !((s & s) | T) simplifies to F because s & s = s (whether s is true or false, s AND s is always s), s OR T is always T and NOT operator changes it to F. Let's simplify it:

w | F simplifies to w. So, !(w | F) becomes !w, where w can either be true or false. 

Since, we know that the output of any Expresssion with OR with T will always come out to be T. Therefore, T | !w simplifies to T.

After, this F|(u&F) will become F because  F OR (anything AND F) will be F. Let's simplify it:

T & F becomes F. Hence, ANYTHING AND F will be F.

Similarly, T AND F in ((((T|((k&(F|((!(F|F))|F)))&F))|(!(w|(!((!((s&s)|T))|F)))))&T)&(F|(u&F)))  simplifies to the final output i.e. F (False).

- `T and T` also simplifies to `T` because the `and` operation is true only if both variables are true.
- `T and F` simplifies to `F` because the `and` operation is true only if both variables are true.
- `F and F` simplifies to `F` because the `and` operation is true only if both variables are true.
- `not F` simplifies to `T` because the `not` operation changes the variable to its contrary.
- `not T` simplifies to `F` because the `not` operation changes the variable to its contrary.

The expression inside the second set of parentheses (T|((T&((F|(z|(!(T&F))))&((!(F&(T|(T&F))))&T))))|T) also simplifies to True. Here are the steps:

(F|(z|(!(T&F))) simplifies to True, as T & F is false, ! false is true, or operator with true yields True.
Next, (F&(T|(T&F))) always equates to False, because 'and' operator with False yields False. Hence, !(F&(T|(T&F))) is the negation of False which is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","At first, there are several simplifications we can do right off the bat:
- `p | F = p`, this is because something OR False is always the value of that something.
- `p | p = p`, this is because something OR itself is just that something.
- `T | T = T`, this is because True OR anything is always True.
- `T & T = T`, this is because True AND anything is always that thing.
- `!F = T`, this is because NOT False is True.

So let's replace those parts in the original expression:

`(p & p) | F`

Now , `p & p = p`. This is because something AND itself is just that something. So, we have `p | F` and this results in `p` because `p OR False` is `p`. So, `p` is our simplified logic formula.",p,p

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. For the logical OR operation (|), a variable OR with itself will yield itself, thus y|y = y, b|b = b, T|F = T. 
2. For the logical AND operation (&), a variable AND with itself will yield itself, thus y&y = y
3. For the logical AND operation, if any component is False, the final result will be False, thus l|F= l, b&F= F, T&F = F, (F.&(t&F)) = F.
4. If anything is OR with False, it yields itself, thus, b|F= b, (b | F)&b, we have b&b= b, ((h|((T|F)&T))|F))|F) is equals to (h|T)|F = T , since it contains a True value, T|F =T
5. Considering that False is the neutral element of the OR operation, this means that anything OR with False will result in the original value. 
6. On the other hand, False is an absorbing element of the AND operation means that anything combined with False via an AND operation will result in False.

After considering all these steps, we can simplify given formula as ((y&y)) which is equal to y.",y,y

1. Anything OR False is simply that something, resulting in (T|F) becomes T. Similarly, (d|F) becomes d and (F|F) becomes F.
2. The expression a|(a&a) simplifies to a because a&a is a and a OR a is a.
3. Since anything AND False is False, the expression (!((a|False) & F)))) becomes !False or T.
4. (x&F) equals F because anything AND False is False.
5. Thus, the expression x&(F|F) simplifies to x&F which further simplifies to F.
6. Any value OR True is True, therefore p|((F|T))) is T and (((T|False))|T) is T.

As a result, the expression simplifies to !((v&v) | T), which becomes !(v | T).

3. Therefore, `a|(F&((T&(T&T))|T))` becomes `a|F`, which simplifies to `a`.

4. `(a|(F&((T&(T&T))|T)))|a` now becomes `a|a`, which simplifies to `a`.

6. Likewise, `!(T|T)` becomes `!T`, which is `F`.

7. Additionally, any operation with `F` as in `(F&T)` or `(F|F)` yields `F`.

Anything 'AND' with T remains as it is. So the simplified form is:

(((e|F)|T)|T)&(!(!(F&((F|(k|T))&(T|((j|(T|T))|(F|((s&s)|(T&T)))))))))

Step 2: Simplifying ((e|F)|T)|T

Step 3: T&(...)
Anything 'AND' with T remains as it is. So, the simplified form is:

!(!(F&((F|(k|T))&(T|((j|(T|T))|(F|((s&s)|(T&T))))))))

Step 4: Simplifying inside the NOT (!) operation
