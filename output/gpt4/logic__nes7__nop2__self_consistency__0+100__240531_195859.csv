Similarly, we have an expression for (Y&F), regardless of the value of Y, the result of this operation is False because anything ANDed with False results in False. As such, we can simplify (Y&F) to F. 

Starting with the innermost expressions, let's first simplify the expression (F|(F&(F&F))). From the above, we know that (F&F) simplifies to F. Thus, we get (F|F) which simplifies to F.

Next, let's look at the expression (F&(F&F)). Using what we know, this simplifies to F.

Similarly, (v&(z&F)) simplifies to (v&F), which further simplifies to F.

The next expression to look at is (!((F&F)&F)), which simplifies to (!(F&F)), which further simplifies to (!F). 

Now let's look at the expression (T|(F&(F&F))). This simplifies to (T|F), which further simplifies to T.

On the right side, 
- (!F) is T since ! implies logical negation and the negation of false is true
- Then the expression (F | T | F) simplifies to T since True OR anything is True. 
- Following this, p&T simplifies to p since anything AND True is that thing itself and finally, (p | T) simplifies to T since True OR anything is True.

1. (((T & (n | ((f & f) | (!F)) & (v | T))) | T) & ((T & ((F & T) | T)) & T)). Here, f & f is equal to f. And, (!F) is equivalent to True (T). So the expression can be simplified as:

   Thus, (F & (((n & (n | (n & T))) & T) | ((T | ((T | F) | F)) & T))) simplifies to F. 

2. T | x = T (true or anything equals true.)
   So, ((T | F) | F) simplifies to T.
   Therefore, (T | ((T | F) | F)) simplifies to T. 

3. T & x = x (true and x equals x.) 
   So, (T & T) simplifies to T and thus some parts of the expression become:

   ((F(((n & (n | (n & T))) & T) | (T & T))) simplifies to ((F & (n & (n | T))) | T).

2. The F&(!(T&T)) is False because F is False regardless of what's in the rest of the condition.
3. (!T)|T is equivalent to F|T, which yields True because at least one of the operands is True.

The expression (A&T) will be true if and only if A is True, and (A|(!F)) will always be True since we are taking the logical OR with True. (F|anything) is always equal to the boolean value of that anything, and since we have T in this case, it effectively becomes True. We can, therefore, simplify the expression like so:

((t&(t&T))&(t|((t&(T))&(T))))

We also know that (t&T) is the same as t, since taking boolean AND with True doesn't change the original value. Therefore, 

(t&t)&(t|(t&T)&T)

(t&t) simplifies to t as per AND operation's property and (t&T) becomes t. So:

t&(t|t&T)

The inner OR operation of t|t, i.e., (t OR t), is always t (taking the logical OR of anything with itself doesn't change the original value). So:

- (!T) = F, logical not of true is false.
- (F&T) = F, since 'and' with false is always false.
- (f|T) = T, because 'or' with true is always true.

We can now change the False in the parathenses:
((u&(u&((u|((F)&(F)))&T)))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T))).

From above, we can now simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses, '(F)&(F)' to 'F':
((u&(u&((u|(F))&T)))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T))).

Since the expression in the previous brackets is now 'F', we can replace the whole 'u|(F)' with 'u':
((u&(u&((u)&T)))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T))).

Now the expression 'u&(u&((u)&T))' can be simplified to 'u&(u&T)' since 'u&u' is 'u':
((u&(u&T))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T))).

Furhter simplification it is 'u&T', 'u&u'still 'u':
((u&T)|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T))).

Next simplify '(l&(T&T))&T' to '(l&T)&T' to 'l&T':
((u&T)|(!((l&T)|T))).

Since '(l&T)|T' simplifies to 'T':
((u&T)|(!(T))).

The NOT operation on 'True' results in 'False', so '!T' simplifies to 'F':

(F|T)&F is F because one value is false, and logical and operations require both values to be true. Therefore, (F|(T|T))|((F|T)&F) is T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's determine the results of `F&T`, `T|T` and `!T` that won't be affected by the rest of the formula values. 
- `F&T` = `F` (false and true is false)
- `T|T` = `T` (true or true is still true)
- `!T` = `F` (the opposite of true is false)

Now applying this to the original formula we get:
((((b|F)&T)&b)&!(!((((w|F)|F)&T)|T)))

Simplify further, the operation `b|F` will always be equivalent to `b` (b or false is b), and `w|F` simplifies to `w` (w or false is w). So our expression becomes:

(((b&T)&b)&!(!(((w|F)&T)|T)))

Also, any literal `b` AND `T` is `b` only. So `((b&T)&b)` simplifies to `b` (b and true is b, and then b and b is still b); `((w&F)&T)` simplifies to `w` (w and true is w, w and true is still w). The expression becomes:

(b&!(!((w|T)|T)))

Since `w|T` and `T|T` is always `T`, the expression becomes:

(b&!(!T))

Which simplistically can be rewritten as:

b&!F

Because the `!F` exprssion is always `T` (since the opposite of false is true), the final simplified expression is:

b&T

But since b and true is simply b, the expression is simply:

(T|F) simplifies to T, because anything OR False is itself, and True OR anything is True.
(T&F) simplifies to F, because anything AND True is itself, and False AND anything is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Between True and False, OR logically gives you True, and AND logically gives you False. So T & F simplifies to False (F), and F | T simplifies to True (T).

2. A False OR with anything always results in the other thing. i.e., X | F is X, so F | T is T.

3. Also, for any value X, its negation is basically not-X. So, !F is True (T) and !T is False (F).

Using these, let's simplify the given expression.

(!(!(((F|((!F)|T))|F)&(T&((g|(F&T))&F))))).

Let's start from the innermost part of the logic formula:

Innermost is ((F | ((!F)|T)) | F), which simplifies as follows:

!F is T.
((F | (T | T)) | F) simplifies to ((F | T) | F) which is (T | F), or T.

Next is ((g | (F & T)) & F).
(F & T) is F.
So, ((g | F) & F) simplifies to (F & F), or F.

Now, we get (T & F) - this is for the larger structure (!(!(...)&...))). This simplifies to F.

Finally, we have !(F), which is not-F, or T.

((T&(((i|i)|F)|T)&F)&F)|(F&(p|(F|((j|(T&F))|T)))))

We simplify the inner parentheses:

i|i = i (basic rule of OR operation)

Then, we replace (T&F) with F and i|F with i in the given expression:

((T&((i|T)&F)&F)|(F&(p|(F|(j|T)))))

Again, simplifying (i|T) to T, the expression becomes:

((T&(T&F)&F)|(F&(p|(F|T))))

We replace T with F, the expression becomes:

(F&F)|F&p

Solving F&F gives us F, so we have:

F|F&p

And solving F|p using basic OR operation rule gives us p, so we have:

F|p

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the parts of the formula that are directly surrounding the T and F values or are otherwise simple to compute.

1. `T&F` returns `F`, because T AND F, logically, is False (as both parts of an AND clause need to be true to return True).
2. `F|F` returns `F`, because F OR F, logically, is False (as neither part of an OR clause is true).
3. `!F` returns `T`, because NOT F, logically, is True (as the opposite of False is True).

So the formula becomes

`!(s|(F|(s|T)))&(F|F))`.

Next, simplify other expressions regarding F and T:

1. `F|(s|T)` returns `T`, because `s|T` is always true as `T` is part of an OR clause.
2. `F|F` returns `F`, because neither part of the OR clause is True.

So the formula becomes: `!(s|T)&F`.

Simplify even further:

1. `s|T` is always true, as `T` is part of an OR clause.

So the formula becomes: `!T&F`.

Lastly, break it down to the final version:

1. `!T` returns `F` because NOT T, logically, is False.
2. `F&F` returns `F`, because both parts of the AND clause are False.

So the final version of the formula simplifies to `F`.",F,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any logic operation ORed with False (x | F) will remain x because logical OR with False doesn't change anything. Therefore, we get 

((!(((x|((x|F)|x))&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))) = 
((!(((x|((x|x))&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))).
  
2. If two same logical variable are logically ORed (x | x), the result will again be the same logical variable, so we get 

((!(((x|((x|x))&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))) = 
((!(((x|((x)&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F)))).
  
3. The x still remains the same because x | x is x, thus 

((!(((x|((x)&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F)))) = 
((!(((x|x)&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))).
  
4. Any logic operation ORed with False yields the same logical operand. So, we get 

((!(((x|x)&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))) = 
((!(((x)&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))).
  
5. Any logic operation ANDed with False (x & F) is False. So, 

((!(((x)&F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))) = 
((!((F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F)))).
  
6. The left part of AND operation inside brackets is still False (F & anything) = False. We get 

((!((F)&(!((!(F&T))|F))))&(!(T&F))) = 
((!(F)&(!((!(F&T))|F)))&(!(T&F))).
  
7. The logical NOT of False (!F) is True. The True ANDed with anything gives the value of that ""anything"". 

((!(F)&(!((!(F&T))|F)))&(!(T&F))) = 
((T&(!((!(F&T))|F)))&(!(T&F))).
  
8. The logical NOT of logical AND of False with any logical value gives True. (!F&T) = !(T&T) = !T which is F. Also, let's simplify right part of equation: T&F is F, thus !(T&F) = !F = T.

((T&(!((!(F&T))|F)))&(!(T&F))) = 
((T&(!F) | F))&T).
  
9. Again, the logical NOT of False gives True (!F = T), so we get

2. X OR X is simply X, and ANYTHING AND False is always False, AND ANYTHING OR True is always True, therefore:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can use the following laws of Boolean Algebra:

1) Idempotent laws:
   - p & p = p
   - p | p = p

2) Domination laws:
   - p & F = F
   - p | T = T

3) Negation laws:
   - p & !p = F
   - p | !p = T

4) Identity laws:
   - p & T = p
   - p | F = p

5) De Morgan's laws:
   - !(p & q) = !p | !q
   - !(p | q) = !p & !q

Given these laws, let's look at the formula step-by-step:

1) ((f|(f|((((f&f)&f)&(f|(f|F)))|f)))|(f&(f&(f|(F&F))))).
   
Applying the Idempotent laws, the formula turns into:

2) ((f|(f|(((f&f)&(f|(f|F))))))|(f&(f&(f|(F&F)))))

Using Domination laws, since F&F = F, we simplify to:

3) ((f|(f|(((f&f)&(f|(f|F)))))|(f&(f&(f|F))))

Further applying Idempotent, Identity, and Domination laws:

4) ((f|(f|((f&(f|(F)))))|(f&(f|F))))

Simplifying this further with Identity and Idempotent laws gives:

5) ((f|(f|f|(f|(f|F))))|(f&(f|F)))

This simplifies to:

6) ((f|f|f|f|f|F)|(f&(f|F)))

Again using the Idempotent and Identity laws, we get:

7) ((f|F)|(f&F))

This simplifies to, with Dominance and Identity laws:

8) (f| (f&F))

And finally, using Identity law, the expression simplifies to f. So the simplified logic formula is:

3. Therefore, (F&(T|F)) simplifies to F because an and operation with False results in False.
4. Thus, (f|F) simplifies to f because or operation with False doesn’t change the value of original literal.
5. Consequently, (f&T) simplifies to (f&T) because we cannot further simplify an AND operation with a literal and a True value.

which is just T.

But, the whole statement is
(F & !T).

Here, any statement with ""and False"" or ""not True"" is always False. So, !T is F and then whole statement (F&F) is F. 

So, the original logic statement simplifies to F or False.",F,F
99,logic,self_consistency,(((((w|((w|F)&T))|w)|(w&(w&((w|w)|w))))&T)|(F|(T&T))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((((w|((w|F)&T))|w)|(w&(w&((w|w)|w))))&T)|(F|(T&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (w|F) is equal to w because anything OR False is the same thing itself.
2. Similarly, anything AND True will be the same thing itself. So, ((w|F)&T) becomes w.
3. (w|w) is w because anything OR the same thing will be that thing itself.
4. Analogously, (w&w) is w because anything AND the same thing will be that thing itself. Hence, (w&(w&((w|w)|w))) simplifies to w.
5. (F|(T&T)) is True because False OR True is True.
6. Finally, the whole formula ((((w|((w|F)&T))|w)|(w&(w&((w|w)|w))))&T)|(F|(T&T)) simplifies to ((w|w)&T) | T which further simplifies to (w&T) | T and then to w | T. 
   
So, the simplified form of the logic formula will be w | T which will always be True no matter the value of w because anything OR with True is always True.",T,T
