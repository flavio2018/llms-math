- MAX 2 3 3 3: The highest digit in this list is 3. So, MAX 2 3 3 3 = 3.
- SM 9 6 3 0: The sum of these digits is 18, but applying modulo 10 gives us the remainder of 8. So, SM 9 6 3 0 = 8.

- SM 3 8 5 1: Adding these digits gives us 17. Applying modulus 10 gives us a remainder of 7. So, SM 3 8 5 1 = 7.

Next, we will calculate all SM operators. Remember, SM is sum modulo 10, so we simply add all numbers and take the last digit:

SM(9, 3, 9, 9) = (9+3+9+9) mod 10 = 30 mod 10 = 0
SM(3, 7, 0, 9) = (3+7+0+9) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
SM(9, 8, 1, 4) = (9+8+1+4) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2

Let's substitute these results back into the expression:

[MAX 9 0 [SM 9 2] 7]

And calculate the remaining SM operation:

SM(9, 2) = (9 + 2) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1

Substitute the result back in:

Next, let's simplify the [SM 8 1 5 6] operation. The SM operation is sum modulo 10, so we need to add the numbers and then take the remainder when divided by 10:

= [8 + 1 + 5 + 6] mod 10

- [SM 6 5 3 0] is summing up all the elements (which are 6, 5, 3 and 0) and then performing modulo 10. The result is (6+5+3+0) % 10 = 14 % 10 = 4.
- [MAX 6 1 4 7] is simply getting the highest value among 6, 1, 4 and 7, thus the result is 7.
- [MIN 3 8 9 8] is getting the smallest value among 3, 8, 9 and 8, thus the result is 3.
- [SM 8 4 8 2] is summing up all the elements (which are 8, 4, 8 and 2) and then performing modulo 10. The result is (8+4+8+2) % 10 = 22 % 10 = 2.

Now, replace the results into the original equation:

- [MAX 1 3 2 0] is getting the highest value among 1, 3, 2 and 0, so the result is 3.

- [SM 3 7 1 5] = 3 + 7 + 1 + 5 %10 = 16 %10 = 6.

Computing the next SM operation we get [SM 1 0 9 2] as 2.

- SM 5 7 8 2 = (5+7+8+2) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2

Then the expression turns into:
[MIN 1 [MAX 3 4 4 [MIN 2 6 2 9]] [MIN 2 3 5 [MAX 5 8 0 0]] 1].

Next step is to compute the MIN and MAX operators:
- MAX 3 4 4 = 4
- MIN 2 6 2 9 = 2
- MIN 2 3 5 = 2 
- MAX 5 8 0 0 = 8

Substituting those values gives:
[MIN 1 4 2 [MIN 2 8] 1].

Calculating the remaining MIN operator:
- MIN 2 8 = 2 .

This makes the expression look like this:

= [SM [SM [9] [8] 1 8] 7 4 [8]]

Now, we continue to execute the SM operations:

= [SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 8]

= [SM [(9+8+1+8) modulo 10] 7 4 8]

= [SM [6] 7 4 8]

Perform the [MAX 0 4 0 4] operation, result is 4, and the [SM 6 9 3 8] operation equals 6 (6+9+3+8 = 26, and 26 modulo 10 is 6).

The next operation is the MAX inside the SM, which is [MAX 8 4 4 7]. This results 8. The expression becomes:
