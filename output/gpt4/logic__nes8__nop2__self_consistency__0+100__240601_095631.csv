A: Let's think step-by-step.","The simplification can be performed using the following steps:

1. The expressions (F | (k | T)) and (F | (F & (l | T))), simplifies to T because with logical/or (""|""), as long as one of the operands is true, the whole expression is true. Now, the original expression can be simplified to ((x&(x&T)) | T).

2. Here, (x&T) equals to x because anything logical/and (""&"") with true will yield the original value. Similarly, (m | F) equals to m for the same reason. The expression simplifies to (x&x) | T. And, ((m&m) | m) simplifies to m because x or x equals to x. So, the expression simplifies to (x&x) | T.

3. Here, (x&x) equals to x because x and x equals to x. Applying this to our current expression gives us x | T.

4. Lastly, (x | T) equals to T because with logical/or (""|""), as long as one of the operands is true, the whole expression is true.

(F|F) = F because both sides are False, so the result is False.

((n&F) = F because anything AND False is False.

(T|F) = T because anything OR True is True.

(n|F) = n because anything OR False is itself.

5) '(z|T)' (z or True) is always True, as every condition 'or' True is always True.

(j&T) - This simplifies to j, because anything AND True stays the same.

(j&j) - This simplifies to just j, because anything AND itself stays the same.

(f&T) - This simplifies to f, because anything AND True stays the same.

(f&F) - This simplifies to False, because anything AND False becomes False.

F|F is False
T|T is True

Next, False or True is True:

So it further simplifies to 

(((f&True)|f)&((f&True)|False))&(True)&f)|(False&(!False)).

Then, anything ANDed with True remains same:

((f|f)&(f|False))&True&f)|(False&(!False)).

Simplifying further, we have:

(f&(f|False))&True&f)|(False&True).

Since anything ORed with False remains same and anything ANDed with False is False:

(f&f)&True&f)|False.

AND operation is associative in any order, hence,

((f&f)&f) | False.
 
Since f&f is f, the result is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, any value AND with False is False, and any value OR with False does not change the value itself. And anything AND with True does not change the current value. Additionally anything OR with True always results in True.

Since anything AND with F is F, let's simplify (z&F) as F and (F&F) as F and (F&T) as F:

!(F&(!(F|F|T)))

Again, F OR F remains F and anything OR with T results in T:

!(F&(!T)) 

Also, by the rule that !T is F:

!(F&F)

Here, F AND F is F so,

!F

And, finally, not of False is True. So the expression simplifies to True.

On the second half of the formula,

((F|(F&(!F)))|F)

The expression z|F is equivalent to z.
The expression T|F is equivalent to T.
The expression F|T is equivalent to T.
The expression T&F is equivalent to F.
The expression k&F is equivalent to F.

So the formula simplifies to ((((z&(z&z))&z)|T)|T)|F)&T)|(F&T).

Step 2: The expression z&(z&z) reduces to z.

Stage 1:
((n&((((n|((n|F)&n))&n)|F)|(F|((j&(F&(!F)))|T))))&((F&T)&T))

F&(!F) is False
So it can be simplified to:
((n&((((n|((n|F)&n))&n)|F)|(F|((j&F)|T))))&((F&T)&T))

n|F is n itself.
and
n|T is True.

So it can be simplified to:
((n&((n&n)|F))&T) //where (n&n) is n

(n&n&T)

Stage 2:
(F&T) is False, because False and anything else is False.

Stage 3:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First let's simplify all the occurring T and F symbols:
- (!T) is F (not true is false)
- T|T is T (true or true is true)

- F|T is T (false or true is true)
- !(F|T) is F (not T is false)
- T|F is T (true or false is true)

Second, simplify the unnecessary brackets and ""F"" symbols:
- !F is T
- T&F is F
- T|F is T

Third, erase the unnecessary ""F"" symbols and ""T|F"" is always True:
- T|F is T
- F&T is F

3. T|(T&(!T)) is T as anything 'and' with False is False and T|False is True.
4. ((T|(F|(s|T)))&F) is F as anything 'and' with True is that value itself, and T|s is T, so T|F simplifies to T and T&F simplifies to False.

2) The 'or' operation with False or 'and' operation with True doesn't change the original value. Hence, x|F = x, and x&T = x.

3) 'And' or 'or' operation with the same value doesn't change the original value. Hence, x|x = x, and x&x = x.

2. Substituting these equivalent expressions, the expression becomes:
   `((o|((((o|o&T)&(o&o|o))&o)|o))&(((a|F)|F)|T))` simplifies to `((o|((((o|o)&o)&o)|o))&((a|T))`.

((T|(F|F))|(F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T)))|(!(F&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First simplify inner sets with constants, so:
(!F&T) is always False.
(T|T), (T&F) are True and False, respectively.

Also note that, since anything OR true is True and anything AND false is False, then,
(p&F)|(T&F), (g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)) simplifies to False in each case.

So, the expression reduces to:
(T|(F|F))|(F&((False) | (True))|False) = T|(F|False) | (False|True|False) = T|False|True, which simplifies to True. 

Hence, the given logic expression simplifies to True (T).",T,T

(!((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can apply some basic logical simplifications:

- Anything OR-ed (|) with True (T) is True:  o|T  -->  T
- Anything AND-ed (&) with False (F) is False:  F&(...)  -->  F
- The negation of True is False, and vice versa:  !T  -->  F and  !F  --> T
- Anything OR-ed with False is itself: F|(...) --> (...)

Using these rules, we get:

!((T)&((F)|((F)&F))) -->
!(T&F) -->
!(F) --> 
T  

So, the simplification of the provided logical formula results in True (T).",T,T
