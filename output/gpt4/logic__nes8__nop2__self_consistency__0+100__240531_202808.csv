((T|F)&F) simplifies to False because (T|F) is True and True & False is False
(n & (n | F)) simplifies to n
(T | (F | F)) simplifies to T since T or anything is T

4) f&T = f (f and True is always f)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, remember logical not (!) changes the truth value of any logical value.

Because of this, any place in the formula where !F shows up, we can replace it with T, and any place where !T shows up, we can replace it with F.

Thirdly, True or anything is True, False and anything is False.

(((j&(j&T))|(!(((f&T)|((T|(T&T))|((T|T)|T)))|(f&F))))|(F&T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider the following basic concepts of logical simplification:

1. X & T = X: There is no change in the value of X irrespective of the operation with True.
2. X & F = F: Any 'and' operation with False results in False.
3. X | T = T: Any 'or' operation with True results in True.
4. X | F = X: There is no change in the value of X irrespective of the operation with False.
5. !T = F & !F = T: 'not' operation just reverses the existing value.

Using these concepts, we can simplify the given expression:

(((j&(j&T))|(!(((f&T)|((T|(T&T))|((T|T)|T)))|(f&F))))|(F&T))

Firstly, 'and' operation with True in a bracket doesn't change its value. So, j & T = j. Hence, the expression becomes:

(((j & j)|(!((f & T)|(T|(T|T))))|F)

'and' operation on similar variables doesn't change their value. So, j & j = j. Moreover, 'or' operation in a bracket with True results in True. So, T|(T|T) = T. Again, 'and' operation with True doesn't change its value. Hence, f & T = f. The expression thus simplifies to:

(j | (!((f|T)|F))) | F

'or' operation with True results in True. So, f|T = T. The expression thus reduces to:

(j | (!T | F)) | F

'not' operation reverses the existing value. So, !T = F. Thus, the expression becomes:

(j | (F | F)) | F

F | F = F (as or operation with False won't change its value). The expression simplifies to:

(j | F) | F

Again, 'or' operation with False doesn't affect its value. So, j | F = j. Hence, the final expression is:

j | F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the following simplifications can be applied to any formula:
- F&T = F because False AND anything is False.
- T|anything = T because True OR anything is True.
- !T = F because NOT True is False.
Using these rules the following simplifications can be done:

1. Simplify (F&T) to F, which gives (((F)|T)|(T|((F|F)&(((q|(q&q))&(T|((!T)&(o&F))))&(F|F))))).

2. Simplify F|T to T, which gives (((T)|(T|((F|F)&(((q|(q&q))&(T|((!T)&(o&F))))&(F|F))))).

3. You can simplify !(T) to F at two places, once in &(T|((!T)&(o&F)) which changes !(T) to F and,
   second in (!(T))&o, which gives !(T)&o to F&o. So, you have (((T)|(T|((F|F)&(((q|(q&q))&((T)&(o&F))))&(F|F))))).

4. Now, simplify F&F (F AND F) to F and F&o (F AND o) to F, this gives (((T)|(T|((F|F)&(((q|(q&q))&(T))&(F|F))))).

5. Simplify F|q (F OR q) to q, q&q (q AND q) to q and F|F (F OR F) to F. This gives (((T)|(T|((F)&(q&(T))&F))))

6. Now simplify T|T to T, F&q to F and F&(T) to F, this gives (T|T)&(F).

Next, | is the OR operator, so F|T and T|F will both simplify to T. So the expression becomes:

f & T is equivalent to just f. So, the expression becomes:

((((f|f)&((f|F))&T)&f)|(F&(!F))

Since f OR f is simply f, and f OR False (F) is also f, the expression can be further simplified to :

(((f&f)&T)&f)|(F&(!F))

Then, f AND f equals f, and True AND f equals f. So the expression becomes : 

((f&T)&f)|(F&(!F))

Ultimately, we know that F and (not F) results in a contradiction (False), so F&(!F) simplifies to F. Therefore, we end up with:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The logical formula (F&T) will be always FALSE as False AND Anything = False.
2. Similarly, if we see the term (F|T), it will be always TRUE per definition of OR operation (False OR TRUE = True).
   
3. Now, we simplify the expression:

   (y|false) = y. This is because Anything OR False = Anything.
   
   (y&true) = y. This is because Anything AND True = Anything.
   
   (!(!F)) = true. This is due to double negation. Negating False gives True, and negating this again gives True.
   
4. Now replace these simplifications in the given expression:

   (y | y) = y. This is because Anything OR Anything is simply Anything. 
   
   (Anything | true) = true. 
   
   
7. Replace these in the expression,

   - The negation of F, i.e., !F, is always T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the constants in the expression.
!F is T (the negation of False is True)
!T is F (the negation of True is False)
F|anything is always equal to the value of anything (since False ORed with anything is the same as the value of anything)
T|anything is always T (since True ORed with anything is always True).

This simplifies our formula to:
((g|((g&g)&(T|(f&T)))&g)&(|T)).

Then simplify (g&g) to g (since any value AND-ed with it is the same value) and (T|(f&T)) to T (since True or anything gives True). 

This further simplifies our formula to:
(g|g)&g&|T).

Finally, g|g also simplifies to g, giving you:
g&g&T. 

This further simplifies to g&T.

((i&(True&((i&(i|(i|i)))|T)))&T)

This can be simplified to:

((i&(True&(i|T)))&T)

Considering that 'i' or 'True' is always True, then:

((i&(True&True))&T)

This become:

(i&T)

Now, the second part of the formula:

(((o&F)&T)&F)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Narrowing down the formula to basic semantics we get:
- The logical 'and' with True i.e., (&T) will always reflect the other value, so y&T would be just 'y'.
- The logical 'or' with False (|F) will always reflect the other value, so ((y&F)|F) would be just 'y'.

2. Taking into account the logical 'not' of True i.e., (!T) will always result in False.

3. An 'or' operation with True (|T) will always yield True whether the other value is True or False. So, ((T|F)|(T|F)) would be T. 
   Making (T|F) more simplified, we get T.

4. Any value 'or'ed with False simply gives us the value back. Hence, (((m|m)|((T|F)|(T|F)))|F) gives (((m|m)|T)|F) which finally gives (T|F) = T.

5. Inserting the above values back into the formula, we get (((y&T)|F)|(F|((!T)&(((m|m)|T)|!(T|T))))). This simplifies to ((y|F)|(F|((F&T)|F))), which then simplifies to (y|F|F|T), which finally equals to T as 'or' with True always yields True.

3. Simplify the expression ((c|T)&(!F))&T to T. This derives from previous step.
4. Now simplify the expression (((z|(((c|T)&(!F))&T))|T)&F). This whole expression evaluates to F, because &F (and false) will always result in a false value no matter what the rest is.

((s&T)|(((((p|p)&p)|p)&(p|(F|((F|(T|F))&((F|F)&T)))))&F))

The expression (T&F) will always be False as both conditions can't be true simultaneously. So, ((s&T)|F) simplifies further into:

(s|F)

Which simplifies to just s, as anything logically OR'd with False is true if it is True and False if it is False. 

Then we observe that (p | p) simplifies to p.

(s| (((p & p ) | p) & (p | ((F | (T | F))& (F & T)) & F)))

The expression F&T is always False, as both conditions can't be true simultaneously. And anything logically OR'd with False and logically AND'd with False gives False. Hence, the above expression further simplifies into:

d&(T|F) = d&T = d since logical AND with True does not change the value.
(F&(!T))&(!T) is equal to F. 

After all the simplification, it is clear that the part (!(((d&(T|F))&(F&(!T)))&(!T))) will result in T, because this expression is the negation of F.

Step 3: Simplify i&i and c|c, given that all other literal values can be either True or False. 
i&(i&(!F)) simplifies to i&i = i since applying AND to the same variable does not change its value.
c|(c|F)) simplifies to c|c = c since applying OR to the same variable does not change its value.

So, the formula becomes: 

(!((i|((T|(v|((d&T)|(T))))&F))|(q|(((T|(!F))|F)&T)))).

But ""d&T"" depends on the state of 'd'. If 'd' was False, the entire thing would be False due to the 'and' operator; if 'd' was True, it would be True. Thus, it can be replaced as it does not influence our final output. So our expression simplifies to:

(!((i|((T|(v|T)))&F))|(q|(((T|(!F))|F)&T))).

The expression ""T|(v|T)"" is also True, as per 'or' laws. It becomes:

(!((i|T)&F)|(q|(((T|(!F))|F)&T))).

However, anything 'or' with True results in True. Thus, ""(i|T)"" can be replaced by True or 'T'. The expression becomes 

(!(T&F)|(q|(((T|(!F))|F)&T))).

as an 'and' operator with False always results in False. Thus, ""T&F"" results in False or 'F'. Thus, expression becomes:

(!F | (q | (((T | (!F)) | F) & T))).

In the second half of the formula, the ""T | (!F)"" evaluates to True because either 'T' is True or 'F' is False. Thus, the expression simplifies to:

(!F | (q | (T | F) & T)).

""!F"" is an operation 'not false', which is of course True. 

Also, the expression ""T | F"" simplifies to True because either 'T' is True or 'F' is False.

The expression now simplifies to:

(T | (q | T & T)).

Anything 'and' with True will remain the same, thus ""T & T"" can be replaced by T and thus, the expression becomes:

(T | (q | T)).

Anything 'or' with True results to True. Thus, ""(q | T)"" can be replaced by T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we will examine the sub-expression (!T), which negates the given T to F.

Secondly, we evaluate the expression (!T) | T, which means false or true, that will be true (as logical OR operation results true if one of the arguments is true)

Let's look at the sub-expression (F|F), it will result to false (logical OR operation results false only in case all arguments are false).

Following the previous one, the expression (T&(F|F)) will result to false (as logical AND operation is true only if all arguments are true).

Now, looking at sub-expression (F | T), means false or true. So, it results in true (logical OR operation results true if one of the arguments is true).

The expression (T|(F|T)) gives true since the OR operation is true if either T or (F|T) is true.

The sub-expression (T&T) gives true because in AND operation if all the arguments are true, the result is true.

The expression (!(T&T)) gives false. As the result of (T&T) is true, negating the outcome will lead us to false.

Spiraling backwards to the external most expressions, i.e., ((r|T)&(F)) will result to false (since AND operation is true only if all the arguments are true).

Now, the sub-expression (F & F) this also gives false.

Finally, if we crunch everything down, we can simplify the original expression to be F, (as we just have False and And operation with True, which will result False) So,  (((!T)|T) & (F & ((F | ((r|T) | ((T & (F|F)) & (T|(F|T))))) & (!(T&T))))) simplifies to F.",F,F

1. (((g & (((F | ((F&F)&T))&F)|(! (F&((F&F)|T))))) | F) | (F & (p | (v | T))))

2. Simplify (F&F) to F => (((g & (((F | (F&T))&F)|(! (F&(F|T))))) | F) | (F & (p | (v | T))))

5. Again simplify (F|F) to F => (((g & (F| !F)) | F) | (F & (p | (v | T))))

6. Remember the principle: (A| !A) is always True. Therefore (F| !F) is T. So, (((g & T) | F ) | (F & (p | (v | T))))

7. And anything &(and) with True remains the same, so the equation reduces to ((g | F ) | (F & (p | (v | T))))

- The expression F&T is equal to False (F) because one of the operands is False.
- The expression a&a is simply a, and ((a&a) | (a&a)) is equivalent to a, so the overall expression becomes ((k | F) & (a & F)) which simplifies to (k & a & F). 

But, k&a&F reduces to False (F) because F is and-ed with other literals.

4. T|(w&F) equals T. This is because a logical or (T|w&F) is True if either of the operands is True. Here, since T is True, the whole statement becomes True, irrespective of the value of w&F.
5. (T|T)&F is equivalent to T&F, which simplifies to F for the same reasoning used in step 1.
6. (!(((T|wx&F)&F)|n|T)) is equivalent to !F. This is because a logical or (F|n|T) is True if either of the operands is True. Here, since T is True, the whole statement becomes True, irrespective of the values of F and n.
7. The whole expression !F equals T. The logical not operator (!) negates the truth value of the operand. Since F is False, the expression becomes True.

3. Moving on, F|(p|(x|T)))|F = F|T = T, because F OR with anything is just that thing, and anything OR with True (T) is True (T).
4. This gives you T&T = T. 
5. Then, the expression becomes !((!F)&(v&F|T)) = !((!F)&T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","According to the rules of Boolean algebra, any statement and-ed with F (false) results in F, and any statement or-ed with F remains the same statement, i.e., (X&T) is X, (X&F) is F, (X|T) is T and (X|F) is X. The NOT (‘!’) operation changes T (true) into F and F into T. 

So let's follow these rules:

1) (F|F) simplifies to F and (F|F|F) simplifies to F
2) (!F) simplifies to T
3) ((F|F)&T) simplifies to (F&T), which simplifies to F
4) From the previous step, we have ((!F)|F|F), which simplifies to T|F|F, further simplying to T.
5) Consequently, we are left with (F&T), which simplifies down to F.
6) Similarly (!T) simplifies to F and (F|F) simplifies to F.
7) Therefore, we are left with (F&F)&((!(((F&F)&T)&T))&F), which further simplifies to (F&F)&((!F)&F), then simplifies to F&F, and finally simplifies to F. 
8) Lastly, going back to the original logic formula, we have (x&F)&F, which simplifies to F&F, and finally simplifies to F.

2. !F is always T because logical not switches the value.
3. r|F is always r because logical or expression is true if at least one literal is true.
4. (((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F)) is therefore (!F)&T or equivalently, T because we've established that r|F is r and T&F is F. 
5. Since T&T is always T, (((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F))|r) is r|T which is always T (again, logical or expression is true if any literal is true). 
6. Hence, ((g|g)|g|(((((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F))|r)&F))|((g|(g&(!F)))&T)) simplifies to

- Anything OR with False gives the value of that anything, therefore o|F = o and F|F = F; 
- Anything AND with False gives False, therefore ((o|F)&F)&F becomes F&F = F;
- Not False (!F) gives True;

Putting this all into the formula: 
(((((s|F)&T)&T)|((!(T&F)|F))|True).

Let's continue: 
- Anything AND with True gives the value of that anything, therefore (s|F)&T = s&True = s;
- (T&F) = False, therefore !(T&F) = !False = True;
- True OR with anything gives True, therefore (!True)&F = True&F = F;

4. Also, h AND h is just h, which leads to (!(!((h&T)|(d|(!(!(T&(T&T)))))))).
5. Logical conjunction with True (h&T) still gives us h, so formula becomes (!(!(h|(d|(!(!(T&(T&T)))))))).
6. Notice that T&T is True and !T is False, so there is double negation that basically gives us original True value: (!(!(h|(d|(!T))))).
7. Let's work on the innermost negation here. As we mentioned earlier, it negates True to False: (!(!(h|(d|False)))).
8. Now, any logical disjunction with False just remains same so it simplifies to (!(!(h|d))).

Next, (F&((F&(!F))|F))) simplifies to (F&(F|F)) because F&(!F) results in F, which then simplifies to F, because F&(F|F) results in F.

So, we have ((F|T)&((v|F)&F)), which simplifies to (T&(v&F)) because F|T results in T, then (T&F) simplifies to F, because T and F results in F.

`((((y&w)|T))|y)&(y|((((y|F)&T)|F)|y))&(y|F))`.

And `(y&w)|T` equals `T`, because anything logically 'or' with true is always true. Also, `(y|F)` equals `y`, for the same logic as above. So, the expression becomes:

`(T|y)&(y|((((y&T)|F)|y))&y)`.

`(T|y)` equals `T`, because anything logically 'or' with true is always true. Also, feel free to simplify `((((y&T)|F)|y)` to `y`. Thus, the expression becomes:

`T&(y&y)`.

Finally, simplify `y&y` simply to `y` for the same reasons explained above. Therefore, the full simplified logic formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: Simplify c | c to c, as any boolean ""or-ed"" with itself is equal to itself.
So, ((c | c)...) simplifies to (c...)

Step 2: Any boolean ""or-ed"" with ""True"" will always be true. That is, (T | T) simplifies to T.
So, (l | (T | T)) simplifies to (l | T), which simplifies to T.

Step 3: Negation of ""False"" is always ""True"".
So, (!F) simplifies to T.

Step 4: Any boolean ""and-ed"" with ""True"" is equal to itself.
So, (T & T) simplifies to T.

Step 5: Any boolean ""or-ed"" with ""False"" is equal to itself.
So, (F | (T & T)) simplifies to (F | T), which simplifies to T.

Step 6: Any boolean ""or-ed"" with ""True"" will always be true.
So, (T | (!(F | (T & T)))) simplifies to T.

Step 7: Any boolean ""and-ed"" with ""False"" will always be false.
So, (F & (F | (T | T))) simplifies to F.

Step 8: Any boolean ""or-ed"" with ""False"" is equal to itself.
So, (m | ((T | (!(F | (T & T)))) | (F & (F | (T | T))))) simplifies to (m | T | F), which simplifies to T.

1. F&F = F. Given that False && anything = False.
2. F&T = F and T&F = F. Applying same logic as from step 1.
3. x|F = x and v|T = T. A logical OR operation with False doesn't change the operand and with True, it always yields True.
4. ((x&T)&T) = (x&T). An AND operation with True doesn't change the operand.
5. ((((x&T)&T)|(F&T))&T) simplifies to ((x&T)&F) based on steps 3 and 4. And (x&T)&F simplifies to F, since anything AND False is always False.
6. ((x&F)|F) becomes (F|F) which finally simplifies to F.
7. ((((x|F)&T)|x)) becomes ((x|T)|x) based on step 3 and this simplifies to T|x which ultimately equals T, since a logical OR operation with True always yields True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to remember these logical rules:

2. T | F = T, because ""or"" operation requires only one operand to be True for the result to be True.
3. !T = F and !F = T, because ""not"" operation changes the value of the operand.

Now, let's start simplifying:

(((T&T)&F)&F)&T is equivalent to (F&F)&T which simplifies to F.

Then, (!(!F) is equivalent to !(T) and simplifies to F.

So the expression becomes:

!((T&((!(f&F))&F))&F)

Again, (f&F) is F and !(F) is T, simplifying the formula to:

!((T&T&F)&F) which is !((T&F)&F) and finally we get !(F&F).

- The conjunction of a value with true is just the value itself: X & T = X
- The conjunction of a value with false is always false: X & F = F
- The negation of false is true: !F = T

So, let's simplify:

This becomes:

So the formula simplifies into: ((c|(c&T))&(s|(F|(((((T&F)|(T&F))&T)&((T&T)|F))|T))).

Step 2: Simplify (c|c&T). It simplifies to c, because anything OR that thing AND something else is still that thing.

So the formula simplifies into: (c&(s|(F|(((((T&F)|(T&F))&T)&((T&T)|F))|T))).

Step 3: Simplify ((T&F)|(T&F)). Since the AND of anything and False is always False, both (T&F) operations return False. So we have now (False|False), which simplifies to False (F).

Step 4: Simplify ((False)&((T&T)|F))&T). Since the AND of anything and False is always False, it simplifies to F.

Step 5: With F|T, since anything OR True is always True, it simplifies to T.

The result is: v

This is possible because the conjunction (""&"") between 'v'. For example with the statement 'A & B', if any of A or B or both are F then the result must be F. Therefore in a long series of conjunctions like this, even if one 'v' were F all other 'v's would turn F, making the whole statement F. But if all 'v's are T, then whole statement would turn T. Therefore in reality it doesn't matter how many 'v's are being conjuncted together, if 'v' is T then the result is T, if 'v' is F then the result is F. Hence we can simply consider this long series of conjunctions of 'v' as simply v.",v,v

    4.  X & X = X  (logical AND of ways with itself)
    5.  X | (X & Y) = X  (absorption law)

Based on these rules, we can start simplifying our formula as follows:

    T|F = T              (Logical OR with False)
    T&T = T              (Logical AND with True)
    
Substitute these in the main formula:

We get:
((l|(l&T))|(l&((l&l)&(((l&T)&l)&((l&l)&T)))))

((l|(l&T))|(l&(l&((l&l)&(l&T)))))
