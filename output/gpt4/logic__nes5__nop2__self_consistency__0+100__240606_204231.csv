A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, start with simplifying the innermost logical operations. We have:

- T | F = T (anything ORed with False remains the same value),
- T | T = T (any value ORed with itself does not change),
- T&F = F (both values in logical AND must be True to get True, otherwise it results in False),
- F&F = F (both values in logical AND must be True to get True, otherwise it results in False).

Substituting this values, the expression changes to:

(T&(t&F)&((!T)&T)). 

Continuing with simplifying, we get:

- (t&F) = F (value in logical AND must be True to get True),
- (!T) = F (NOT True results in False).

Then the expression looks like:

(((w|w)|T)|(((w|w)&((!F)&(h&F)))&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","- **w|w** is equivalent to **w**. This is because ""or"" is true if at least one value is true. Therefore, w ""or"" itself will not change its value (if w is true, w ""or"" true is true, and if w is false, w ""or"" false is false). 

- **w|T** is equivalent to **T**. This is because ""or"" is true if at least one value is true. Thus, w ""or"" true is always true.

- Similarly, **(!F)** is equivalent to **T**. By applying the logical not operation to a false value returns true.

- **(h&F)** is equivalent to **F**. This because ""and"" is true if both values are true. Thus, h ""and"" false is always false.

- **T&F** also reduces to **F**. Here, the logical operation 'and' only produces a true outcome when both the left and right operands are true. However, since we have 'false' as the second operand in this case, the final result of the operation becomes 'false.'

- So, **T&F&F** simplifies to **F**. Using the commutative property of 'and' operation, we can rewrite the expression as (T&F)&F. We already know that T&F = F. So, the simplified expression becomes F&F = F.

- **T|F** simplifies to **T**. That's because the logical operation 'or' will only result in 'false' if both the operands are 'false,' but since we have 'true' as the first operand, the final result of the operation is 'true.'

""True or x"" is always True (since at least one of them is True), so ""T|T"" simplifies to ""T"".

T|F equals to T, as logical OR with True always returns True.

Logical AND with False equals False and logically AND with True returns the other value. 
So, F&T is F.

We can apply these rules to the formula for the simplification.

- Within the innermost parentheses, we have:

Next, if you logically compare something with itself, it retains its value.

We end up with `(F | T)`. This equals T because for OR operation to evaluate as True, at least one operand needs to be True.

((((q|(q|F))&(q&(q&T)))&T)&(T&(F&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, let's simplify the inner brackets one by one. We have four operations to simplify: ""(q|F)"", ""(q&T)"", ""T"" and ""(F&F)"".

- For any logic formula, ""|F"" has no affect because q or False is simply q. 
So, ""(q|F)"" is simply ""q"". 
- For the same reason, ""&T"" has no affect as well, because q and True is still q. 
Therefore, ""(q&T)"" equals to ""q"". 
- ""T"" always means True, we won't make operations on it because it doesn't need any simplification.
- We know that ""False & False"" is ""False"" because both inputs have to be True for ""and"" operation to return True. Thus, ""(F&F)"" is ""F"".

Now, we can replace those parts in the formula:
((((q|(q|F))&(q&(q&T)))&T)&(T&(F&F))) becomes ((((q|q)&(q&q))&T)&(T&F)).

In this formula, all the operations are now simplified as much as possible. Next, let's simplify the formula by applying the operations.

- ""q|q"" equals to ""q"" because when both inputs are the same, ""or"" operation returns the input. Thus, we can simplify ""(q|q)"" as ""q"".
- ""(q&q)"" is also simply ""q"" because both inputs being the same makes ""and"" operation return the input.

So, our formula ""((((q|q)&(q&q))&T)&(T&F))"" becomes ""((q&q)&T)&(T&F)"".

At this point, we repeat the step above and simplify the remaining ""(q&q)"", ""(T&F)"" and ""(T)"" (we are dealing with the ""T"" for the first time now even though we've mentioned it before):

- we simplify ""q&q"" as ""q"" because both inputs are equal.
- ""T&F"" as ""F"" because ""and"" operation needs both inputs to be True to return True. If any of them is False, it returns False.
- ""T"" as ""T"" because it's already simplified.

After replacing those parts in the formula, ""((q&q)&T)&(T&F)"" becomes ""(q&T)&F"". 

In the last step, the final operation is ""and"" where one of the inputs is ""F"". According to the ""and"" operation rules, this expression would give ""F"" no matter what the other input is. 

In the end, ""((((q|(q|F))&(q&(q&T)))&T)&(T&(F&F)))"" simplifies to ""F"".",F,F

2. T applied to any logical operator will always return T. Hence, (T&T) simplifies to T. 

3. (s|T) simplifies to T, because regarless of the value of s, if T (true) is present, the whole portion is True, as ""|"" is a logical OR operator.

Therefore, the expression becomes ((((x|x)&T)|x)|T).

4. (x|x) simplifies to x, because the value of x OR x is simply x. The same goes for (x&x) which simplifies to x again, the value of x ANDed with x is x.

We know that `Val` AND true (`T`) leaves `Val` unchanged, so `(c&T)` simplifies to `c`. 

We also know that a value `Val` OR `Val`, leaves `Val` unchanged, so `c|c` simplifies to `c`.

This allows us to simplify the formula's inner parts:

Again, anything OR False will give the same thing. Therefore: 

- (a|F) = a 

Substituting this we will get:

((a|a)&a)

Anything OR itself will give the same thing. Therefore: 

- (a|a) = a 

Substituting this we will get:

(a&a)

Anything AND itself will give the same thing. Therefore: 

- (a&a) = a 

So, the simplified version of the logical formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, in the expression (((T|F)&(F&T))&(F&F))), F&T will always be False regardless of the value of T. The whole formula becomes (T|F)&F&F, which can be simplified to False, because i) T|F == True, and ii) True & F == False. When False is ANDed with any other value, the result is always False.

Secondly, r|r is always equal to r, because i) r is either True or False, and ii) a value ORed with itself is always itself.

(!((T&(F|(T&F)))&(!(T&(T&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the inner-most parentheses:

- (T&F) => False, because AND operation results TRUE only if both literals are TRUE.
- (F|(T&F)) => F, because OR operation results TRUE only if at least one literal is TRUE.

So, the formula simplifies as:

!( (T&F) & !(T&T) ).

Then, simplify the second layer:

- (T&F) => False.
- (T&T) => True.

So, the formula becomes:

!( False & !True ).

Next, simplify the not operation:

- !True => False.

So, the formula simplifies to:

!( False & False ).

In the next step, AND operation results TRUE only if both literals are TRUE, so:

False & False => False.

So, the final formula is:

!False.

And finally, NOT operation changes TRUE to FALSE and vice versa, so:

!False => True.

Therefore, the simplified formula is True.",True,T

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, simplify the parts of the formula:
- (F&F) always equals to False, because it is ""False AND False"".
- (T|(F&F)) can be simplified to T, because it is ""True OR False"".
- (d&F) always equals to False, because it is ""something AND False"".
- (!((d&F)&F)) can be simplified to True, because it is ""NOT(False)"". 

By substituting these things in, you get:
(((l&T)|l)|True), which simplifies progressively to:
- (l|l), because l and True is always l.
- l, because ""something OR something"" is always something itself.

And so, the entire formula simplifies to l.",l,l

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value AND-ed with False (F) directly becomes False. So (T&F) becomes F, and (F&F) becomes F. Thus the formula becomes ((T&(T&(o&F)))|(k&((T&F)|F))).
2. Any value AND-ed with True (T) remains the original value. So (T&F) becomes F, T&o becomes o. Thus the formula becomes ((T&(T&F))|(k&(F|F))).
3. Logical OR operation: F OR F is always False. So the formula now becomes: (T&(T&F))|(k&F). 
4. In addition, any value AND-ed with False (F) directly becomes False. (T&F) becomes F, and (k&F) becomes F. So the formula becomes: T&F|F.

((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, note that anything (say X) AND with False (F) is always False. Hence (a&F), (h&F) and ((a&F)&F) are all False.

Second, anything (say X) Or False (F) is always X itself. Hence, (f|F) is f.

Third, anything (say X) AND with True (T) is always X itself. Hence, ((F|(h&F))&T) is ((F|F)&T), which is (F&T), which is F.

Replace all these step by step in the original formula:

((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))))

(((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b)&(!(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's treat T as a True and F as a False value. Also, realize that, when logical OR (|) operation is performed with False, it does not affect the value of the other operand. Similarly, logical AND (&) when performed with True doesn't affect the value of the other operand. Therefore, these are some of the facts that will help us to simplify the expression. 

- !( !T ) converts to T, because not of not True is True. 
- F|(F|F) converts to F, because logical OR of False with False is False.
- b|(F) converts to b, because logical OR of any value with False is the value itself.
- (((b&T)|b)|b) converts to (b|b), because b AND True is b itself. Now, logical OR of b with itself is b.
 
Therefore, the expression simplifies to (b&T).",(b&T),b

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F|F is false (false OR false equals false)
2. !T is false (NOT true equals false)
3. ((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F))) can be written as (F|(((F&F)|T)|(T&F))). 

Breaking it further the simplification can be done as:

4. F&F is false (false AND false equals false)
5. F|F is false (false OR false equals false)
6. (F&F)|T is true (false OR true equals true)
7. T&F is false (true AND false equals false)

So, the statement (F|(((F&F)|T)|(T&F))) becomes (F|(T|F)). 

8. T|F is true (true OR false equals true)

Finally, the statement: 

9. (F|(T|F)) results in T, which is True.
