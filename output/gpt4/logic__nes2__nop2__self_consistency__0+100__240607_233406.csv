A: Let's think step-by-step.","We know that any value AND False (y&F) invariably results in False. Thus, we can simplify (y&F) to F.

The scenario of a reality AND the same reality (z&z), invariably equates to the reality itself since we are considering the same the reality out of the two, which is z.

The formula then becomes z|F. 

For ""OR"" (|) condition,
