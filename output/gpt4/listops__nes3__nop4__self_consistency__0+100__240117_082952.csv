A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve the three MAX operators:

MAX 9 6 9 7 = 9,
MAX 4 7 8 2 = 8,
MAX 4 9 8 2 = 9. 

Then we need to solve the SM operator:

SM 9 0 = 9 (since 9 + 0 is 9 which is less than 10, we don't need the modulo operator in this case).

SM 7 6 9 4 = 6 (since the sum of 7+6+9+4 is 26 and 26 mod 10 = 6).

Next, we solve the MIN operators:

MIN 6 6 3 = 3,
MIN 8 6 9 5 = 5. 

Then we put these results back into the main equation:

[SM [MAX 4 9 8 2] 0 3] 3 
= [SM 9 0 3] 3 
= [SM 9 3] 3 
= [12] 3
= 2 3

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we have to solve the operations that are in the most inner brackets:

[SM 7 6 1 7] results in (7 + 6 + 1 + 7) modulo 10 = 21 modulo 10 = 1.

[MIN 9 3 8 6] results in the minimum number among 9, 3, 8 and 6, which is 3.

[SM 7 2 5 9] results in (7 + 2 + 5 + 9) modulo 10 = 23 modulo 10 = 3.

So, we replace these values in the original expression:

[SM 3 9 [MAX 4 1 1 [MAX 9 0 5 0]] [MAX 2 3 7 3]].

We can proceed to solve the next bracketed operations:

[MAX 4 1 1 [MAX 9 0 5 0]] results in the maximum number between 4, 1, 1 and (MAX 9 0 5 0).

[MAX 9 0 5 0] results in the maximum number between 9, 0, 5, and 0, which is 9. 

Replacing these values we get:

[SM 3 9 [MAX 4 1 1 9] [MAX 2 3 7 3]].

We can now solve the remaining MAX operations:

[MAX 4 1 1 9] equals 9 (since 9is the maximum number). 

[MAX 2 3 7 3] equals 7 (since 7 is the maximum number). 

Now, with the results, we can simplify the expression further:

[SM 3 9 9 7].

We can now solve the SM operation:

[SM 3 9 9 7] equals (3 + 9 + 9 + 7) modulo 10 = 28 modulo 10 = 8.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the SM operation:

Replace these results in the expression:
[MAX [MIN 5 3 4 2] 5 [MIN 8 0 0] 3]

Third, evaluating the remaining MIN operations:
Calculate [MIN 5 3 4 2] = 2

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the operations inside the inner brackets:

MAX 3 5 6 7 = 7 (since 7 is the maximum number)

SM 0 8 0 7 = 15 modulo 10 = 5 (since sum of the numbers is 15 and 15 modulo 10 is 5)

SM 9 3 8 8 = 28 modulo 10 = 8 (since sum of the numbers is 28 and 28 modulo 10 is 8)

SM 0 7 5 8 = 20 modulo 10 = 0 (since sum of the numbers is 20 and 20 modulo 10 is 0)

So, the expression [MIN 9 5 [MAX 3 5 6 7] [SM 0 8 0 7]] [SM [SM 9 3 8 8] 1 5 [SM 0 7 5 8]] 5 1 becomes:

[MIN 9 5 7 5] [SM 8 1 5 0] 5 1.

Now, let's compute the brackets containing MIN and SM:

MIN 9 5 7 5 = 5 (since 5 is the minimum number)

SM 8 1 5 0 = 14 modulo 10 = 4 (since sum of the numbers is 14 and 14 modulo 10 is 4)

So, the expression is now: 5 4 5 1.

The operator outside of these results is MIN, so we look for the minimum in this list:

MIN 5 4 5 1 = 1 (since 1 is the minimum number).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, evaluate the expressions inside the innermost brackets, [SM 8 5 0 4] and [SM 0 0 3 3]. The SM operator calculates the sum modulo 10. Hence, [SM 8 5 0 4] = (8 + 5 + 0 + 4) modulo 10 = 17 modulo 10 = 7, and [SM 0 0 3 3] = (0 + 0 + 3 + 3) modulo 10 = 6 modulo 10 = 6.

So the entire expression now simplifies to: 

[SM [MAX 4 0 7 6] [MIN [MIN 6 2 5 6] 5 8 [MAX 7 5 1 3]] 7 7]

Next, evaluate the expressions in the brackets for the MAX and MIN operators.

[MAX 4 0 7 6] = 7 (the highest value in the list)

[MIN 6 2 5 6] = 2 (the smallest value in the list)

[MAX 7 5 1 3] = 7 (the highest value in the list)

So the entire expression simplifies to:

[SM 7 [MIN 2 5 8 7] 7 7]

Next, simplify [MIN 2 5 8 7], which is equal to 2 (the smallest value).

Now, the entire expression simplifies to: 

[SM 7 2 7 7]

Finally, calculate the sum of these numbers modulo 10 using the SM operator.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the sum modulo operations (SM). Remember, ""sum modulo 10"" involves adding the numbers together and if the sum is more than 10, you keep subtracting 10 until you get a single digit number.

[SM 4 5 8 7] = (4 + 5 + 8 + 7) modulo 10 = 24 modulo 10 = 4

[SM 5 6 4 8] = (5 + 6 + 4 + 8) modulo 10 = 23 modulo 10 = 3

Then we solve the minimum operations (MIN).

[MIN 5 1 4 9] = 1

[MIN 9 4 9 5] = 4

[SM [MIN 5 1 4 9] 3 [MIN 9 4 9 5] 1]

= [SM 1 3 4 1] = (1 + 3 + 4 + 1) modulo 10 = 9

So now the original equation looks like this:

Now let's solve the maximum operations (MAX)

[MAX 0 3 4 3] = 4

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we deal with the operations inside the brackets. 

[MIN 7 9 2 7] = 2 (which is the smallest number),
[MAX 3 0 9 4] = 9 (which is the largest number),
[MAX 1 3 1 2] = 3 (which is the largest number),
[MIN 8 9 0 1] = 0 (which is the smallest number).

So, our expression now looks like this:
[MAX 2 [SM 8 2 0 9] 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

Next, proceed with the SM operation:
[SM 8 2 0 9] = (8 + 2 + 0 + 9) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9.

So, our expression now looks like this:
[MAX 2 9 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

Next, proceed with the MAX operation:
[MAX 5 3 1 0] = 5 (which is the largest number).

So, our expression now looks like this:
[MAX 2 9 1 5].

Finally, proceed with the last MAX operation:
[MAX 2 9 1 5] = 9 (which is the largest number).

Therefore, the answer is 9.",9,9

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[SM [SM 4 [MAX 9 2 5 9] 6 [MAX 3 0 7 5]] 4 [MIN [MAX 7 9 9 9] 7 [MAX 5 6 1 5] 1] 1].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we find the MAX of each [MAX] operation:
- MAX of 9,2,5,9 is 9
- MAX of 3,0,7,5 is 7
- MAX of 7,9,9,9 is 9
- MAX of 5,6,1,5 is 6

So the original expression becomes: [SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1].

Then, we calculate the SM of the first [SM] operation:
- SM of 4,9,6,7 is (4+9+6+7)%10 = 6

So the original expression becomes: [SM 6 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1].

Next, we find the MIN of [MIN] operation:
- MIN of 9,7,6,1 is 1

So the expression becomes: [SM 6 4 1 1].

Finally, we calculate the last SM operation:
- SM of 6,4,1,1 is (6+4+1+1)%10 = 2

So the answer is: 2.",2,2

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[SM [SM [MAX 9 2 4 6] [MAX 8 2 4 0] 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] [MIN 8 9 1 6]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, execute the inner-most MAX and MIN commands:
[SM [SM [MAX 9 2 4 6] [MAX 8 2 4 0] 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] [MIN 8 9 1 6]]] simplifies to
[SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] 1]].

Next, execute the inner-most SM commands:
[SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] 1]] simplifies to
[SM 26 7 4 [SM 2 7 18 1]].

Then apply the modulo 10 operation to the result of the sum (SM) commands. The modulo operation gives the remainder of a division. In this case, modulo 10 gives the remainder of a division by 10:
[SM 26 7 4 [SM 2 7 18 1]] simplifies to
[SM 6 7 4 [SM 2 7 8 1]].

Next, we execute the remaining SM command:
[SM 6 7 4 [SM 2 7 8 1]] simplifies to
[SM 6 7 4 18].

After applying the modulo 10 operation again:
[SM 6 7 4 18] simplifies to
[SM 6 7 4 8].

Finally, adding up the numbers gives 25 and applying the modulo 10 operation gives the final result: 5.",5,5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's solve the MIN and MAX operations:

- [MIN 8 0 6 1] is 0, because 0 is the smallest value.
- [MIN 0 3 2 5] is also 0 for the same reason.
- [MAX 0 4 0 4] is therefore 4, because 4 is the highest value.

Secondly, let's solve the SM operations:

- [SM 3 8 8 0] is (3 + 8 + 8 + 0) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9, because 19 cannot exceed 10, we take the remainder when 19 is divided by 10.
- [SM 6 9 [MIN 7 3 5 4] 8] is (6 + 9 + [MIN 7 3 5 4] + 8) mod 10. The [MIN 7 3 5 4] operation gives us 3. So, the expression becomes (6 + 9 + 3 + 8) mod 10 = 26 mod 10 = 6.

The last step is to find the [MAX 4 6 7] operation, which gives us the maximum value 7. So, the solution is 7.",7,7

- MIN 1 4 8 9 = 1
- SM 3 1 1 4 = (3+1+1+4)%10 = 9%10 = 9
- MIN 0 7 5 0 = 0

Then substitute these values back into the expression:

MAX 3 3 [SM 0 1 1 8] [MAX 7 9 0 9]
MAX 7 9 0 9 = 9

Now continue with the second bracket:

SM 0 1 1 8 = (0+1+1+8)%10 = 10%10 = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the innermost MIN and MAX operations:

[MIN 6 3 4 3] = 3
[MIN 4 1 3 8] = 1
[MIN 9 3 4 4] = 3
[MAX 8 4 4 7] = 8

Substitute these results back to the expression:

[MAX [MIN 3 7 1 9] 8 7 [SM 3 1 8 8]].

Then, we continue with the next innermost operation, which is another MIN:

[MIN 3 7 1 9] = 1

Substitute it back:

[MAX 1 8 7 [SM 3 1 8 8]].

Then, consider the SM operation:

[SM 3 1 8 8] = (3 + 1 + 8 + 8) modulo 10 = 20 modulo 10 = 0

Substitute it back:

[MAX 1 8 7 0].

Finally, calculate the MAX operation:
