A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, remember that T&T is T, T|T is T, F&T is F, and T&F is F, and there are a lot of these expressions in your initial formula. 

Also, note that for any variable v: 

- v|v = v 
- v&v = v

Now, simplify the formula:

1) !(T&F) = !F = T, as T&F is F and not of the False is True.
2) (T&T)|T = T|T = T
3) ((m&T)|((((m&(((T&T)|T)&(!F)))&T)&((m|(T&F))&T)) = ((m&T)|(m&(T&T)&T)) = (m&(T|T))&T = (m&T)&T = m&T, as m|(T&F) is m|F, which is m, and applying the distributive law: m&T or m&T is just m&T.

Now, we plug in the simplifications into the initial formula:

4) ((m|((m&T)|(m&m))|m)&(m|((i|F)&F)) simplifies to (m|(m&T)|m)&(m|(i&F)) = m&(m|(i&F)), as we already said that (m|F) is m, and (i|F) is i. 

Since i&F = F, the formula simplifies to:

5) m&(m|F) = m&m = m.

So, the simplified formula is: m.",m,m

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to consider some basic properties of logical operators:

- ""A | B"" is true if A is true, or B is true, or both are true. 
- ""A & B"" is true if both A and B are true.
- ""!A"" is true if A is false. 
- ""T"" is always true and ""F"" is always false. 

Starting from the innermost expressions:

1. ""(!F)"" is true because 'not false' is true.
2. ""F | (!F)"" is true because 'false or true' is true.
3. ""((F|(!F))&T)"" is true because 'true and true' is true.
4. ""!((F|(!F))&T)"" is false because 'not true' is false.
5. ""j|(!((F|(!F))&T))"" simplifies to ""j|F"" because 'j or false' is simply j.
6. ""((j|(!((F|(!F))&T)))&j)"" simplifies to ""j&j"" because 'j and j' is simply j.
7. In the second part of the expression, ""F|(T&T)"" simplifies to ""F|T"", which is always true. 
8. ""((F&T)|(T|T))"" simplifies to ""F|T"" because 'false and true' gives false and 'true or true' gives true. 'false or true' is true.
9. ""(((F|(T&T))|(((F&T)|(T|T))&F))"" simplifies to ""T|F"" because 'true or false and false' simplifies to 'true or false' which is always true.
10. The term ""(w|T)"" is always true because anything or true is always true.
11. The entire term within the outer brackets of the second part ""((((j&(((F|(T&T))|(((F&T)|(T|T))&F))&(w|T)))&j)|j)|F)"" can hence be simplified to ""j"".

Therefore, the entire original expression simplifies to ""(j|j)"" which is simply ""j"".",j,j

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can notice a few key points:

1. ""!((k|F))"" simplifies to ""!k"". The reason being, ""k|F"" will be either True (if k is True) or False (if k is False). So the negation of that will be ""!k"".
   
2. ""k|(k&F)"" simplifies to ""k"". This is due to the identity that says if we have ""p OR (p AND q)"", it will always simplify to ""p"".

3. ""t|F"" simplifies to ""t"".

4. ""F|(T|F)"" simplifies to ""T""

5. ""j|(T|F)"" simplifies to ""T""

6. ""F&(F&T)"" simplifies to ""F"".

Following these simplifications above, we can eliminate and simplify the original formula step by step:

1. ""!((k|((k&(k|F))&((((t|(F&(j|(T|F))))&t)&(F|((F&((F&T)&T))|T)))|T)))|(F|(T|F)))"" 
     can be simplified to:
     ""!((k|((k&(k))&(((t&(T&t))&(T|T))|T)))|T)""

2. This simplifies to ""!((k|(k&(((t&t)&T)|T)))|T)""

3. And this simplifies to ""!((k|(k&((t&T)|T)))|T)""

4. That can be simplified further to ""!((k|(k&t)|T)""

5. Finally, this simplifies to ""!((k|t|T)""

And knowing that ""k|t|T"" will always be True (because it involves an OR with True), we then have ""!T"", which is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we can simplify any ""A & F"" or ""A | T"" as follows:
    - ""A & F"" is always False regardless of what A is.
    - ""A | T"" is always True regardless of what A is. 
2. Second, we can simplify any ""A | F"" or ""A & T"" as follows:
    - ""A | F"" is always equivalent to A.
    - ""A & T"" is always equivalent to A. 
3. Any expression like ""A & A"" or ""A | A"" is always equivalent to A. 

Using these rules, let's simplify the given formula.

(((i|(i&((((((i|F)|(((i&i)&i)|((z&F)&T)))|(i|F))&i)&(i&(i&i)))&T)))|(T|(F&(F&(T&T)))))

First, simplify inner brackets with rule 1:
- ""z & F"" becomes F, 
- ""F & T"" becomes F, 
- ""F & (F & (T & T))"" becomes F.

So the formula becomes:

(((i|(i&((((((i|F)|(i|i)|F)|(i|F))&i)&(i&i))&T)))|T))

Now we can simplify with rule 2: 
- ""i | F"" becomes i,
- ""i & T"" becomes i.

So the formula becomes:

(((i|(i&((((i|i|i)&i)&i)))))

Now we can simplify with rule 3:
- ""i | i"" becomes i,
- ""i & i"" becomes i.

So the formula becomes:

(i|(i&(i&i)))

Finally we simplify with rule 3 again:

(i|(i&i))

Which simplifies to:

So the final simplified form is just:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F or F equals to F, F and F equals to F, and not F equals to T. So simplify all instances of F OR F, F AND F, and NOT F in the given logic formula. We have:

    (((g|((((((F|F)&(((m&m)|m)|(T)))&T)&F)|F)&(T)))|((g&T)|F)) | F).

2. We can simplify (m&m) to m because something AND itself always equals to that something. Let's simplify that:

    (((g|((((((F&((m|m)|T))&T)&F)|F)&(T)))|((g&T)|F)) | F).

3. m or m equals m, and m or T always equals T. Any value AND T will be the original value, but any value AND F will always equals to F. Let's simplify:

4. ((g)|(F)) equals (g|F), and (F&F) equals to F, and F or F equals to F. Let's simplify:

3. ""NOT False"" (!F) will always be True, so we replace ""(!(!F))"" to ""T"".

4. Double NOT (!!) is equivalent to no NOT. So we skip those.

5. From previous steps, the expression is simplified to:

- T&F simplifies to F and F&T simplifies to F. So (!(T&(F&T))) simplifies to !(T&F) simplifies to !F to T.

- F|F simplifies to F. so ((!(F|F))|F) simplifies to Tso this part ((!(F|F))|F)&(!((!F)|T)) simplifies to T&(!((!F)|T)) simplifies to T&(!(T)) simplifies to T&F simplifies to F.

From this, we know that ""u | u"" = ""u"". So, it simplifies again to:
(u|(!T)|(u|((!T)&(w&((F&F) | w | F | (!T))&(T|T)))).

Next, two more things are straightforward here. ""!T"" evaluates to ""F"" and ""T | T"" evaluates to ""T"" as well, so we simplify this to:
(u|F|(u|((F)&(w&((F&F) | w | F | F)&T)))).

Next, as u | F is ""u"", T & w is w and F | F is F, the equation simplifies into:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First let's look at all the constant values (T and F) and simplify where we can:

!(!T) is same as T, 
F&(!F) is F, 
F|F is simply F, 
a|T is T,
T|F is T,
F&T is F

Putting these values back in the original expression the formula will be simplified as follows:

((y|F)&((!(!(F&T)))|!((F&T)|F)|T)).


2. Now we can simplify it further:

F|T simplifies to T,
F&T simplifies to F,
!(!T) or !!F simplifies to T or F,
y|F simplifies to y.


So, the expression then becomes:

y & (T | !(F | F | F | T)).

3. Now let's simplify this:

Any F OR something simplifies to something, so F|F|F|T simplifies to T. Given !T simplifies to F, it can be replaced in above formula. And Finally, any F OR something simplifies to something

So, the final simplification would be:

y & T = y.

3. Values ORed with F always yield the same values (since something OR False is always the value) and values ORed with T always yield T (since something OR True is always True).

4. Double negations cancel out.

2) Anything OR with T is T and anything & (and) with T remains the same, hence (r|T)&(T&T) simplifies to T&T, which further simplifies to T.
3) Hence the term !(!(((r|T)&(T&T))&F)) is the same as !(!T) which simplifies to F.
4) The term (!F)&F simplifies to (T)&(F), hence it is F.

Consequently, the expression simplifies to ((o&((o|o)|F))|(m&F)&T)&F) | ((u&F)) where m is from the simplification k|(((y|(!F))&F)&T)) to m.

2. Looking at the expressions T&F, These would be False as well, and T|F would be True as True or anything would be True.

2. X|Y is true if either X or Y are true. If both are false, then the result is false.
3. !X is true if X is false and vice versa. 

Simplification:

i. T&F evaluates to F since both values aren't true.
ii. F|F evaluates to F since both values are false.
iii. F|(F&T) simplifies to F | F (As F & T is False) which further simplifies to F since both are false.
iv. !(F|(F&T)) calculates to !F as per iii (which gives T because the negation of F is T).
v. (u&u) simplifies to u because it's the same literal.
vi. (F&F) is F because both values are false.
vii. ((u&u)|(F&F)) simplifies to u | F as per v and vi (which is u). 
viii. ((u|F)|F) simplifies to u | F (which is u).
ix. T|T is T
x. (T|T)&T equals T&T as per ix (which is simplified as T).

Therefore: 
((T&F)&((F|F)&(((F|(!F))&(F|((u&F)&F)))&((T|T)&T))) 
can be rewritten and simplified as:
(F&F)&(F&T)&F 
which is F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify some of the operations involving the True and False values. 

The logical not of True is False, and vice versa. The statement a|F is always equal to ""a"" since anything logical or with False is equal to the first statement. Similarly, for the logical and operator, anything logical and with True is equal to the first statement and anything logical and with False is always False. 

In addition, the statement a|T is always True, since anything logical or with True is always True. 

So that simplifies the formula to:

(((i&(i|(i&(i&i))))&i)&((i&i)|i)&T)

Next, note that a&a or a|a is always equivalent to ""a"", since the and operation on the same statement always equals the statement, and the or operation on the same statement always equals the statement.

4. Any statement logically ORed with True is True, so ""(F | (z | (F | T)))"" simplifies to ""T"".

3. ""(T&(!T))"" will be False (F) as well, because True AND False is False.
4. Now, we see that we have ""(F&X)"" which will be False (F) for any X. Therefore, both ""((x|F)&T)"" and ""((x&x)&x)"" are False (F).
5. Also, ""(X&F)"" is False (F) as well, so with the above we get the subformula ""((((x|F)&T)|((x&x)&x))&F)"" as False (F).

w&w simplifies to w.

Since !T is F, it becomes: (w&((m&((d&i&F)))|T)).

Next, since d&F is F, the formula simplifies to: (w&((m&F)|T)).

m&F simplifies to F.

2. Simplify z|(z|(z|z)) as z, because a value ORed with itself will just be the original value.
3. Evaluate F&(T&F) as F, because when we AND something with False, we get False (False AND anything is False).
4. Evaluate (F|(F|F)) as F, because when we OR False with False, we get False (False OR False is False).
5. Evaluate (T&(F&(T&T))) as F, because False AND anything is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Start by simplifying the parts where we know the values, F stands for False, and T stands for True:
    - F|F: since both are false, the result is False.
    - F&T: since one part is false, the result is False.
    - T&T: since both are true, the result is True.
    - F|(!T): not true is false, so this is equivalent to F|F which is False.
    - (T&T)|F: since T&T is True, this is equivalent to True|F which is True.
 

2. Substitute the simplified parts in the preceding formula:
    - ((l|(((l|((F|((p|(False))&(False))|(False)))&(False))))|F)&l))|(F|((F|((True)|F))|T)).
   

3. Continue with the simplification. Here, consider that:

Furthermore, (F & anything) always equals F because AND operation with False results in False, irrespective of what ""anything"" is. Also, (anything | F) or (anything & T) equals ""anything"" itself.

Applying the above rules, in particular, (!(T|(!(T&F)) on the first line simplifies to !(T|!F) and further simplifies to !(T|T), which equals F. Further simplifying, f|F equals f. Moreover, ((f|f) equals f, and f&F equals F, hence (f|(f&F)) equals (f|F) and eventually equals f. Then, the formula becomes (f|f), which simplifies to f.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the parenthesis that are only depending on logic constants T and F.

T&F = F     because AND operator only outputs True if both operands are True.
T|F = T     because OR operator outputs True if at least one of the operands is True.

thus:
(T|(T&F)) simplifies to (T|F) which equals T
(T|(T|F)) simplifies to (T|T) which equals T
F&(F&T) simplifies to F&F which equals F

the original formula then becomes:
((T&(!((w|(T|T))&(!((T&((m|F)&T)|T)|(t|(!F))))))).

We can further simplify
(T|T) is T
(T&((m|F)&T)|T) simplifies to ((m&T)|T) since m can be either T or F and AND operation with T will output m.
(!(F)) simplifies to T

We then substitute back into the formula:
((T&(!(w&T)&(!((T|T)|(t&T))))))

(T|T) simplifies to T
(!((T|T)|(t&T))) simplifies to (!(T))

We substitute that back in:
((T&(!(w&T)&(!T))))

F|T is T because False or True is True.
!T is F because not True is False.

Now let's substitute these values back to the formula:

(((!F)&F)|(!((T)&((!(F&((F&(F))|(F&((t|t)&F)|F)))|(!(!T))))).

This simplifies to:

((T&F)|(!(T &(!(F|!T))));

6. Using the same logic from above, this still simplifies to F|((T&F)&l) = F|F|l = l, because anything or-ed with False results in itself.

2. Any value AND with F is F, while any value OR with T is T, and any value AND with itself is this value, so the expression can be further simplified to: (((x&T)&x)|F) = ((x&x)|F) = (x|F).

    So the statement simplifies to:
    (((j&True)&!((True&True)|(False&False)))).
  
2. The logical NOT operation negates the result of the operation it is applied to. So, Negation (!) of False is True, & Negation (!) of True is False.

    Now, apply that to the previous statement:
    (((j&True)&!(True|False))).
  
3. Now follow the rule mentioned earlier that Logical True ('T') with anything in AND '&' operation will return the other operand. And, Logical True ('T') with anything in OR '|' will return True ('T').

    Apply this to the previous statement and this simplifies to:

2. Noting this, we simplify by removing all the entities that are OR'ed with T and those AND'ed with T. So, (!(!((T|(F&T))|T)))&(((g&(T|(!T)))|T)) would be equal to !(!T)&g. Any double negation (like !(!T) ) is simply the un-negated value (i.e., T).

4. !(T|F) would be equivalent to !(T), since F OR'ed with any value is that value.

5. Therefore, we can simplify the expression ((T&(T&((T&((!(!((T|(F&T))|T)))&(((g&(T|(!T)))&T)|T)))|(!(T|F)))))|((T&(w|T))|T)) to be simply g (regardless of whether w is T or F).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, it is a well-known fact that:

1) T or X is always T regardless of what X is.
2) T and X is always X regardless of what X is.
3) F or X is always X regardless of what X is.
4) F and X is always F regardless of what X is.
5) not T is always F.
6) not F is always T.

The starting formula is:
((T|((((F&(k|T))&F)|((((x&(((!T)|(T|T))&T))&((x|(!T))|F))&T)&F))&F))&((F&(!T))|T))

Let's apply these principles to simplify.

Starting with the centermost operations:

(!T) = F

(T|T) = T

(k|T) = T

(x|(!T)) = x|F = x

Now our formula looks as follows:
((T|((((F&T)&F)|((((x&((!T|T)&T))&(x|F))&T)&F))&F))&((F&F)|T))

From here, we simplify the 'F&T' operation to get:

(F&T) = F

and

(x&((!T|T)&T)) = x&(T&T) = x&T = x (as X and true always X)

Our formula becomes:

((T|(((F&F)|((x&(x|F))&T)&F))&F))&((F&F)|T))

Then we simplify 'F&F' becoming F, and thus:

(((F&F)|((x&(x|F))&T)&F)) = F

(x&(x|F)) = x&x = x

Thus the formula now is:

((T|F)&((F&F)|T))

We've already established that:

(F&F) = F

(T|F) = T

Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

(T&((F|T))

Which is then further simplified to:

(T&T) = T

And there you have it, the final simplified form of the logic formula is T.",T,T

4. (F|((Ts)&(T|F))) = T. This is because any statement where logical or is true, it will always result as true.
5. (!(!(j&(a&(!T)))) = (j&a&F) = F. Here, (!T) = F and j, a, and F are connected with logical and. Since F is in the mix, the answer to the logical and operation will always be false.

3. Negation of False is True. Therefore, replacing !(F) turns into T and the the whole formula becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, let's simplify the innermost brackets. Any value OR'd (|) with False (F) remains as the value itself. So, #((l|F)&T) becomes (l&T), which is essentially l since any value AND'd (&) with True (T) remains as the value itself. Also, (F&(F|(T|(F&T)))) becomes False (F) because False AND any value is False. So, the formula becomes ((!(F|((l|((l&l)&l)&F)|T))|(!(!((y|y)&F))))).
   
2. Next, inside the brackets we see ((l&l)&l) that becomes l because True AND True = True and False AND False = False. So, the formula turns into ((!(F|(l&F)|T))|(!(!((y|y)&F)))).

3. Now, we see (l&F) but any value AND'd (&) with False (F) is False (F). So, it becomes ((!(F|F|T))|(!(!((y|y)&F)))).

4. Let's look at the bracket inside the NOT operation (!). Because False OR False = False and False OR True = True, we get (!T)|(!(!((y|y)&F))).

5. (!T) is False and ((y|y)&F) is False because any value AND'd (&) with False (F) is False (F), so other bracket becomes (!(!F)) which simplifies to True. So, formula simplifies to F|T.

6. Finally, False OR True is True. This leaves us with our final simplified logical formula being T or True.",T,F

((!(((e&((e|((((e|e)&(l|T))&e)&(e|(e|e))))|((e&e)|e)))|(F&(F&F)))|T))|(!((T|F)&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, (l|T) would constantly generate True since an OR operation with True always results in True. 

Similarly, (T|F)&T would give us True as an AND operation with True does not change the value, and True or False results in True. (!True) would then always equal False.

In addition, since F&F would equal False, F&(F&F) will still give us False. When this False is then OR'd with anything else (in this case, !(e&((e|((e&e)&(e|(e|e)))|e))), the result will only depend on the value of this complex expression and not the False value.

For the Truth tables of the AND and OR operations, when it comes to (e|(e|e)), (e|e)&e, and (e&e)|e, these can be simplified to e since OR-ing e with itself doesn’t give anything new and AND-ing e with itself also keeps the same value.

Now, if we simplify with these observations, we end up getting the following statement

!(((e&e)|F)|T)|F which simplifies further to !(T|F) which results in !T. The final result would be False.",False,F

((j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T))&(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. `(T&(T|T))` will always be `T` because true `and` or `or` true always equals `T`.

2. `!(!(T))` will be `T` as negation of the negation is the statement itself.

3. `F&(T)` will be `F` as false `and` any other statement always equals `F`.

4. `((F&T)|T)` equals `T`, because `or` operator with `T` results into true.

5. Now, `j&(F|T)` will resolve to `j`, as false `or` true always will be `T` and `and` operator with `T` returns the statement itself.

6. `(F&((F|T)|(F&(n&F))))` will be `F` since `and` operator with `F` on left or right side gives `F`.

7. `!(i|F)` will be `!i` because `i` or `F` simplifies to `i`.

8. `(T&!i)` will be `!i` because `and` operator with `T` returns the statement itself.

9. `(((!i)|F)|T)` equals `T`, because `or` operator with `true` gives true.

Overall, the result of the whole logic formula is `j`.",j.,j
