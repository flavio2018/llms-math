A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, observe that T (true) & T (true) equates to T, and (F&F) equates to F, (F&T) equates to F, (T&F) equates to F and (!F) equates to T. So, you can replace these in the original expression.

The expression then becomes: 
((T&((!F)&(((F)|T)&(((m|F)&(m&T))&(F))|T))))|(F&T))&(F&T)

Now notice (F)&(m|F)&(m) is always equal to m, and (F)&T converts to F, and (F)|T converts to T. 
So, you can simplify further to: 
((T&((T)&(((F)|T)&((m)&(F))|T))))|(F))&(F)

Using the fact that (F)|T and (F)&(m) equates to T and F, respectively, you can simplify it to:
((T&((T)&((F)&(F)|T))))|(F))&(F)

T&T equates to T, F&F and F|T equates to F and T respectively, substitute these values in the expression:
((T&((T)&((F)|T))))|(F))&(F)

Again, T&T equates to T, you can simplify further to:
((T&((F)|T)))&(F)

Finally, T&F equates to F, substiting these values into the expression, you get:
(F)&(F) 

F&F equates to F. So, your final simplified result will be:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First of all, we have a simplification rule that says ""not of not A"" is simply A. So, (!(!F)) will just be F.

2. Secondly, F OR A is simply A. Therefore, F OR T will be T.

3. Thirdly, !T (i.e., NOT True) is F (False). So, !F will simply be T.

4. In a similar way, the expression !(!((T|F)&F)) simplifies to !(!(T&F)). Again, we'll make use of the simplification rule A OR F is A, where A is any logical variable. So, T|F becomes T and F&T becomes F. So !(!(T&F)) simplifies to !(!F) which in turn simplifies to F.

5. Now, we have an expression T & F which is always F (because AND operation will be True only if both operands are True; otherwise, it's False).

6. Similarly, A|F where A is a logical variable simplifies to A. Therefore, n | F becomes n.

7. The overall expression now becomes (((F|T)&((g|((g&(l|(n|T)))|F))&F)).

8. Removing the unneeded brackets and substitute the result of F & A (i.e., F) (based on the simplification rule F & A is F) gives us T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all we need to simplify all the expressions that contain True and False values exclusively.

- F&T -> This is False. Because when we do logical 'and', if any of the values is False then the result is False.
- F|T -> This is True. Because when we do logical 'or', if any of the value is True then the result is True.
- r&F -> This is False.
- x&(b&F) -> This is False, because (b&F) is False.

Now plug these simplified expressions back into the original formula:

((((T&False)&T)|(!(T|((False|True)|h&(((False)|F)|False))))))|(False).

Further simplifications:

- T&False -> This is False.
- False|True -> This is True.

So now the formula is: 

((False&T)|(!(T|True|h&False)))|(False)

Further simplifications:

- False&T -> This is False.
- T|True -> This is True.

So now the formula is:

False|(!(True|h&False))|(False)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","In logical terms:

a) We know F & anything = F, because 'F & T' = F and 'F & F' = F.

c) We also know F | anything = anything, because 'F | T' = T and 'F | F' = F.
d) We know that !(F) = T and !(T) = F.

Applying these rules in the expression:

Step 1: (F & (T | F)) = F & T = F.
Step 2: Hence the whole expression starts with !(F) = T.
Step 3: Inside Nested Part, (((F | F) & T) :: here, (F | F) is F, so it becomes F & T which is F.
Step 4: (((T & F) & F) & ((d & F) & T)) becomes (F & F) & (F & T) which goes to F & F = F.
Step 5: Inside Nested Part, ((F & T) | F) = F | F = F.
Step 6: Using the results of Steps 3, 4, and 5, (F & F) | F, which sums to F.

1. (T|F) will always be T regardless of whether F is True or False.
2. !(T|F) will always be F, because the negation of T is F.
3. Hence, (T&!(T|F)) becomes (T&F), which will always be F regardless of whether T is True or False.
4. So, (((T&!(T|F)))|F) becomes (F|F), which is F, and ((F)|T) becomes T.
5. Hence, the entire expression inside the first parentheses (d|(((T&(!(T|F)))|F)|T)) becomes (d|T), which will always be T because OR operation with T always results in T.

Similarly for the expression inside the second parentheses:

1. (T|(T&(T|F))) becomes (T|T), which is T.
2. (!(T|(T&(T|F)))|F) becomes (!T|F), and the negation of T is F, so it becomes (F|F), which is F.
3. The double negatives cancel each other out, so (!(!((T|(T&(T|F)))|F))) becomes F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, recall that the logical ""and"" operation (`&`) with `F` will always result in `F`, because both values must be true in order for the expression to be true.

So, `T | anything = T` and `anything | T = T`.

Second, the negation of `F` is `T`, and the negation of `T` is `F`. 

Last, if there's an ""or"" operation with the same values, it is equivalent to that value itself. So `x|x=x`.

With these rules in mind, let's simplify your formula:

Simplify inner parantheses first:

((F & ((F & (!(F | (n | T))))) & F) | (!((o & ((o | (o | (o & T)))) & T)) & F))

Then simplify logical NOT notations and remove useless and operations with `F`:

6. The expression at this point is ((T|(!(o|T))&(F|(F&(!F)))).
7. (F|(!F)) is T because either F is True or not True and F&(!F) will be False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the expressions with T and F.

- The expression (T|F) is always T. So we can replace (T|F) with T.
- The expression (T|T) is also always T. So we can replace (T|T) with T.
- The expression (c&F) is always F, no matter the value of c. So we can replace (c&F) with F.
- The expression (f&F) is always F, no matter the value of f, hence replace (f&F) with F.
- Now !(!(T)) is T. So we can replace !(!(T)) with T.
- Furthermore, the expression (X& T) where X can be either T or F is always X. So we replace any such expression with X.
- The expression (X& F) where X can be either T or F is always F. So we replace any such expression with F.

Thus, all consequent expressions with multiple literals become:

(((r|((f&((T|F)&T)|F))|r)&(F&(F&((f&(T))&F))))

This is equal to 

(((r|((f&(T&T))|F))|r)&(F&(F&((f&T)&F))))

Which gives:

(((r|((f&T)|F))|r)&(F&(F&(f&F))))

Now from ((f&T)|F) we get (f|F), hence replace it, and (f&F) turns to F and we get:

(((r|(f|F))|r)&(F&(F&F))

With (f|F) we get T and that will result in path (r|T) which is always true so replace it, and with (F&F) we get F, so replace it:

((r|r)&(F&F))

Seeing as (r|r) it is equal to r, and (F&F) is equal to F, this simplifies to:

(((((!(!(F&((a&a)|T))))|(!(!((T&(T&F))|F))))|F)&(!(!T)))|(T|F))

- T & F simplifies to F, and F | F simplifies to F, making the innermost logical AND and OR operations condense to F.
- If we notice, (T&(T & F)) simplifies to (T&F) which in turn gives us F. And (F | F) gives us F. Now, !F gives us T.
- !(!(F&((a&a)|T))) simplifies to (F&((a&a)|T)) which becomes F (since F with anything AND'ed results in F).
- Now, (F or T) simplifies to T. And NOT T is F. Now we have similar F & F again, so the result is F.
- Lastly, (F | T) simplifies to T.

((F&(!((!(T&((u|T)&T)))|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T)))))|(F)

T|T is T, u|T is always true T, and T & T is also T. Thus, u|T & T results in T. 

So, the formula is now : ((F&(!((!(T&T)))|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T)))))|(F)

Note that !T is always F and !F is always T. 

Thus, this simplifies to : ((F&(!(F))|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T)))))|(F)

Simplify !F to T, which results in : ((F&T|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T))))|(F)

Now, F&T results in F. So, the formula is now : ((F|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T))))|(F)

Simplify further by noting that F|F is always F,

so, the equation is : ((F|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T))).

Rearranging, we get : (!((((h&T)&F)|T)|F))

Since T|F is T, the formula further simplifies to : (!(((h&T)&F)|T)))

Now, h&T could be either T or F. But (T & F) is F, and (F & F) is also F.

So, we now have : (!F|T)))

Finally, because !F is always T, the equation simplifies to : T|T

This results in the final output : T (True)",T,F

((a|((a|F)&(!(((o&F)|F)|((F&F)|T)))&(F|F)))&(T&(!F))).

The conjunction of anything with false is false so ""(o&F)|F"" and ""(F&F)|T"" simplifies to ""F"" and ""T"" respectively. Thus the expression simplifies further to:

The disjunction of anything with true is true thus (F|F) simplifies to ""F"" and ""!((F)|T)"" simplifies to ""F"". So the expression simplifies further to:

The conjunction of anything with false is always false, so (a|F)&F simplifies to F. Thus the expression simplifies to:

The disjunction of anything with false is the original value, so (a|F) simplifies to a. The conjunction of anything with true is the original value, so T&(!F) simplifies to ""T"". Thus, the expression simplifies to:

3. !T is F and !F is T

Applying these rules to the given formula:

 ((F&T) = F) and ((F&F) = F), so we can simplify (((F&T)&(F&F)) to (F&F), which is F.

!F is T, !T is F, so (!T) and !((F&F)) both simplifies to F.

Substitute these results in the nested formula we will have:

 ((x|(!(F))|(!(g|(p|T))))

Also, we know that value |'ed with T is T. So, ((p|T)=T)

So we could simplify the previous formula to ((x|(!(F))|(!(g|T)))

However !(g|T), any value |'ed with T gives T, so (g|T) = T

The negation of T is F. therefore, !(g|T) = F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, (F|T)&(T|T) is T since False OR True is True. Moreover, in any logic operation involving And and True, the result mostly depends on the other value, and T & T = T.

Secondly, (g|F) is g, since if g is True, the whole statement will be True, and if g is False, then the whole statement will be F also. 

As for (F|(F|F)), it's simplification will just be F, since OR-ing false values will always result in F. 

So, since anything And-ed with False will just be False, then the phrase ((((g|F)&((F|T)&(T|T)))|g)&(F|(F|F))) simplifies to F.

Further simplifying, the whole segment ((!(F|((((g|F)&((F|T)&(T|T)))|g)&(F|(F|F)))))&F) changes to F since this segment is just the exact segment we simplified above And-ed with F, which will be F.

Meanwhile, in the left part of formula, (f&(f&f)) is just f. So, (f & F) will just be F since anything And-ed with False is False.

Therefore, the whole logic formula simplifies to (F|F), which results in F.",F,f

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we have the subexpression (F&F). Whatever the value of F, the result of F&F will be False as well, because logical ""and"" operation requires both of its arguments to be true to return true. So each occurrence of (F&F) can be replaced with F.

Then, we have !(F&F), which has already turned into !F. The operation !F negates the value of F, thus changing it into T (as F is False). 

Now we have (w&w). This will always result in the value that W has. If W is true, w&w will be true, if W is false, w&w will also be false. So (w&w) can be replaced by w.

We also have another subexpression, ((w|F)&T). Logical ""or"" operation requires at least one of its arguments to be true to return true. Since we know F is false, we can simplify the inner subexpression (w|F) to just w, and let's simplify the outer subexpression ((w|F)&T) to just w, because anything logical AND with True will just yield the original value.

Subexpression (T&T) is also redundant as it will always yield T.

So the original logic formula can be rewritten as ((k&T)&k)&(k&(w|T)|!T), which further simplifies to k&k&k&(w|T)|!T, since T&k will result in the original value, k.

Since !T is false and anything logical OR with false will yield the original value, and w | T will always yield T , lastly, anything with AND T will be the original value. 

We then get it simplified to k&k&k, which can be simplified to k (assuming k can only be true or false).",k,k

Let's process the formula step by step:

((((z&(z|(F&T)))&T)&(z|(!(((h|(F|(g&F)))&((h&(h|h))|F))|T))))|(z&T))

2. (z|F) = z => The formula becomes

5. (h|F) = h => The formula becomes 

   (((z&T)&(z|(!((h&h)|T))))|(z&T))

6. (h&h) = h => The formula becomes

8. !T = F => The formula becomes

9. (z|F) = z => The formula becomes

10. ((z&T)&z) = (z&T) => The formula becomes

2) Now, simplify ""l|T"". It also simplifies to True since 'or' logic returns True if any one of the operands is True.

3) ""e&(e&(e&(l|T)"" simplifies to ""e&(e&(e&T)"" because 'and' with True doesn't change the value, so it simplifies further to ""e&e&e"" since 'and' with True doesn't change the value. Finally, it simplifies to ""e"" because 'and' with same operand doesn't change the value.

4) ""T|((b&b)|(T|F))"" simplifies to ""T|(b|T)"" because 'and' with same operand doesn't change the value and 'or' with True returns True. It simplifies further to ""T"" because 'or' with True returns True.

6) ""F&(F&(!T))"" simplifies to ""F&(F&F)"" because 'not' operator negates the value. It simplifies further to ""F&F"" and then to ""F"" because 'and' with False returns False.

7) ""F|(F&(!T))"" simplifies to ""F|(F)"" because 'and' with False returns False. This simplifies to ""F"" because 'or' with False doesn't change the value.

8) ""(e&(e&(e&True)))|(F|False)"" simplifies to ""e|F"" because the left part simplifies to ""e"" and the right part simplifies to ""F"". It simplifies further to ""e"" because 'or' with False doesn't change the value.
