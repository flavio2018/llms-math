- [MIN 8 0] = 0
- [MIN 0 5] = 0
- [MAX 2 4] = 4
- [MAX 7 1] = 7
- [SM 3 4] = 7 
- [MIN 1 2] = 1

This gives us the new expression of:

[SM 6 [MIN 4 6]] is the expression we have left.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's clarify that the ""sum modulo 10"" means you add the two numbers and if the sum is 10 or more, you take the remainder when you divide the sum by 10.

The SM [SM 7 2] [SM 6 8] subexpression results in SM [9] [4] = 3, because (9 + 4) mod 10 = 3.

The SM [MAX 9 3] [MAX 2 5] subexpression results in SM [9] [5] = 4, because (9 + 5) mod 10 = 4.

Substituting these values, the entire expression reduces to:
[SM [SM [MIN [SM 1 3] [MIN 3 3]] [MIN [MIN 8 8] [MAX 8 3]]] [MIN [3] [4]]]. This further simplifies to [SM [SM [MIN [4] [3]] [MIN [8] [8]]] [3]].

The MIN [4] [3] subexpression is 3 and the MIN [8] [8] subexpression is 8, so the expression simplifies to [SM [SM [3] [8]] [3]]. The SM [3] [8] subexpression is 1, because (3 + 8) mod 10 = 1. 

This simplifies the expression even more to [SM [1] [3]], which is 4, because (1 + 3) mod 10 = 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, look at the subexpressions:
[SM 9 2] = (9+2) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1, 
[SM 7 5] = (7+5) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2, 
[MIN 6 3] = minimum of 6 and 3 = 3, 
[MAX 6 5] = maximum of 6 and 5 = 6,

Then, the next subexpressions:
[SM 1 2] = (1+2) mod 10 = 3 mod 10 = 3,
[SM 3 6] = (3+6) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9,
[MAX 4 4] = maximum of 4 and 4 = 4,
[MIN 8 2] = minimum of 8 and 2 = 2,
[MAX 4 1] = maximum of 4 and 1 = 4,
[MAX 5 6] = maximum of 5 and 6 = 6,

Next, you can further simplify the subexpressions:
[SM 4 2] = (4+2) mod 10 = 6 mod 10 = 6,
[SM 4 6] = (4+6) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0,

Now taking the minimum and maximum of these values,
[MAX 3 9] = maximum of 3 and 9 = 9,
[MIN 6 0] = minimum of 6 and 0 = 0,

Finally, you can calculate the maximum of these two values:
[MAX 9 0] = maximum of 9 and 0 = 9.

So, the final result is 9.",9,0

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[MIN [SM [MAX [MIN 6 6] [MIN 0 8]] [MAX [MAX 7 6] [SM 1 1]]] [SM [MIN [MAX 5 4] [MIN 1 1]] [SM [SM 1 2] [MIN 1 1]]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the innermost expressions. 

[MIN 6 6] is 6, because the minimum of 6 and 6 is 6.
[MIN 0 8] is 0, because the minimum between 0 and 8 is 0.
[MAX 7 6] is 7, because the maximum between 7 and 6 is 7.
[SM 1 1] calculates to (1 + 1) % 10 = 2.
[MAX 5 4] is 5, because the maximum between 5 and 4 is 5.
[MIN 1 1] is 1, because the minimum between 1 and 1 is 1.
[SM 1 2] calculates to (1 + 2) % 10 = 3.
[MIN 1 1] is 1, because the minimum of 1 and 1 is 1.

Now we can substitute these values back into the original equation and simplify further:
[MIN [SM [MAX 6 0] [MAX 7 2]] [SM [MIN 5 1] [SM 3 1]]].

Next step:
[MAX 6 0] is 6, because the maximum between 6 and 0 is 6.
[MAX 7 2] is 7, because the maximum between 7 and 2 is 7.
[MIN 5 1] is 1, because the minimum of 5 and 1 is 1.
[SM 3 1] calculates to (3 + 1) % 10 = 4.

We substitute once again into our equation:
[MIN [SM 6 7] [SM 1 4]].

Continue simplifying:
[SM 6 7] calculates to (6 + 7) % 10 = 3.
[SM 1 4] calculates to (1 + 4) % 10 = 5.

Now we perform the final operation:
[MIN 3 5] is 3, because the minimum between 3 and 5 is 3. 
So the solution of the given expression is 3.",3,3

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, resolve the operations within the innermost brackets:

MIN [MIN 3 0] = 0

SM 1 5 = 6

MIN [MIN 0 6] = 0

MIN 3 4 = 3

MAX 6 7 = 7

MAX [MIN 3 7] = 7

MAX [MIN 0 7] = 7

MAX 1 0 = 1

MIN 4 6 = 4

MAX [MAX 1 4] = 4

MAX 5 7 = 7

SM 8 3 = 11 (but since it's modulo 10, it becomes 1)

MAX [MAX 7 1] = 7

Now you get, 

[MAX 7 [MIN 4 7]]

Resolve this operation:

MIN 4 7 = 4

So, the final expression will be:

MAX 7 4 = 7

Thus, the answer to the given expression is 7.",7,4
