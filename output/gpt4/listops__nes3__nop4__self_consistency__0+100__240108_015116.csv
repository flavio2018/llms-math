[MAX [SM 1 1] 1 0] 5 [MAX 7 [SM 8 4 6 5] 1 [SM 5 8 0 2]] 9.

Next, let's execute [SM 1 1], the sum is 2. Also, do [SM 8 4 6 5], the sum is 23 but as per rules of SM, we take the modulo 10 of it which results in 3. And for [SM 5 8 0 2], the modulo 10 of the sum is 5. Replace these operations in our expression:

[MAX 2 1 0] 5 [MAX 7 3 1 5] 9.

The result of [MAX 2 1 0] operation is 2. And for [MAX 7 3 1 5], the result is 7. Update these values in the expression:

[SM 4 6 [MAX 1 0 9 1] [SM 8 5 4 6]] corresponds to sum modulo 10 of 4, 6, 9 and the total of [SM 8 5 4 6]. For sum modulo operation, the numbers are added and if the sum is above 10, the tens digit is dropped. 

When we calculate [SM 8 5 4 6], the sum is 23, but we need to take it modulo 10, so the result is 3 due to dropping the tens place.

- [SM 3 7 1 5] = (3+7+1+5) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6

SM 3 9 8 7 means the sum of numbers 3+9+8+7 which is 27. But since SM is also modulo 10, the result is 7 (remainder when 27 is divided by 10). 

Similarly, SM 6 1 3 5 would mean the sum of numbers 6+1+3+5 which is 15 and modulo 10 is 5.

[MAX 5 7 2 2] = 7

So, our expression now becomes:

Performing the MAX operations again, we have:

[MAX 7 4 9 2] = 9

[MAX 2 5 8 7] = 8

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The part [MIN 7 9 2 7] can be simplified to 2, which is the smallest number among 7, 9, 2, 7.
2. The part [MAX 3 0 9 4] can be simplified to 9, which is the biggest number among 3, 0, 9, 4.
3. So we now have to solve [MAX 2 [SM 8 2 0 9] 1 [MAX 5 [MAX 1 3 1 2] 1 [MIN 8 9 0 1]]].
4. The part [SM 8 2 0 9] can be simplified to 1, because the sum of 8, 2, 0, 9 is 19 and modulo 10, it gives us 9.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, evaluate the innermost expressions using the MAX operator:
[MAX 9 2 5 9] equals 9.
[MAX 3 0 7 5] equals 7.
[MAX 7 9 9 9] equals 9.
[MAX 5 6 1 5] equals 6.

Our expression becomes

[SM 4 9 6 7] equals (4+9+6+7) modulo 10 = 26 modulo 10 = 6.

Our expression becomes

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we solve the inner-most brackets, those involving the MAX and MIN operators. 

- MAX 9 2 4 6 gives us the maximum number in the list {9, 2, 4, 6}, which is 9.
- MAX 8 2 4 0 is the maximum number in {8, 2, 4, 0}, which is 8.
- MIN 8 9 1 6 gives us the minimum number in {8, 9, 1, 6}, which is 1.

We substitute the results back into the equation. Now the equation becomes: [SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] 1]].

- SM 9 8 1 8 gives the sum of the numbers (9+8+1+8) modulo 10, which is 6.
- SM 0 6 5 7 gives the sum of those numbers (0+6+5+7) modulo 10, which is 8.

Substitute these results back into the equation and we get: [SM 6 7 4 [SM 2 7 8 1]].

Solve the only bracket that remains:
- SM 2 7 8 1 gives the sum of the numbers (2+7+8+1) modulo 10, which is 8.

Substitute this result back into the equation and we get: [SM 6 7 4 8].
