= -43*a*b*x*y",-43*a*b*x*y,-43*a*b*x*y

((+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y)+(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we combine like terms within each set of parentheses:

In the first set of parentheses, (+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y) simplifies to -90*a*b*x*y. The coefficient is negative, so we find its modulo -100: -90 mod -100 = -90.

In the second set of parentheses, (+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y) simplifies to 30*a*b*x*y. The coefficient is positive, so we find its modulo 100: 30 mod 100 = 30.

Now we combine these two values: -90*a*b*x*y + 30*a*b*x*y = -60*a*b*x*y.

The coefficient is negative, so we find its modulo -100: -60 mod -100 = -60. Therefore, the simplified algebraic expression is -60*a*b*x*y, and the modulo -100 of the numerical coefficient is -60.",-60*a*b*x*y,-60*a*b*x*y
