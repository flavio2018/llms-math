SM 4 9 is equal to (4 + 9) modulo 10, which is 3 because 13 modulo 10 is 3.

SM 3 1 = 3+1 = 4 (mod 10), which is just 4. 
MIN 5 9 = 5, since 5 is the minimum between 5 and 9.
MAX 1 8 = 8, since 8 is the maximum between 1 and 8.
MAX 3 3 = 3, since 3 is the maximum (and only) number.

Now, our expression looks as follows:
[MAX [MIN 4 5] [MIN 8 3]]

Resolve the remaining MIN operations:
MIN 4 5 = 4
MIN 8 3 = 3

So now we are left with:
[MAX 4 3]

Finally, find the maximum:
MAX 4 3 = 4

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the values inside the MAX operators:
MAX 6 3 = 6 (as 6 is the maximum between 6 and 3),
MAX 9 5 = 9 (as 9 is the maximum between 9 and 5).

So, the expression simplifies to:
[SM [SM 6 9] [MIN [SM 8 8] [SM 2 7]]].

Now, calculate the values inside the SM operators:
SM 6 9 = 15 mod 10 = 5 (as the sum of 6 and 9 is 15, and 15 modulo 10 is 5),
SM 8 8 = 16 mod 10 = 6 (as the sum of 8 and 8 is 16, and 16 modulo 10 is 6),
SM 2 7 = 9 mod 10 = 9 (as the sum of 2 and 7 is 9, and 9 modulo 10 is 9).

So, the expression simplifies to:
[SM 5 [MIN 6 9]].

Then, calculate the value inside the MIN operator:
MIN 6 9 = 6 (as 6 is the minimum between 6 and 9).

So, the expression simplifies to:
SM 5 6.

Finally, calculate the value inside the SM operator:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we solve the innermost brackets:
[MAX 0 1] gives us 1 as 1 is the maximum number.
So, [MIN [MAX 0 1] [MIN 7 4]] becomes [MIN 1 [MIN 7 4]].

[MIN 7 4] will give us 4 as 4 is the minimum number.
So, [MIN 1 [MIN 7 4]] becomes [MIN 1 4].

[MIN 1 4] gives us 1 as 1 is the minimum number. So, the left part of the expression is solved.

Let's move to the right part of the expression:
[SM 8 4] gives us 2, because 8 + 4 equals 12 and 'sum modulo 10' of 12 is 2.
So, [SM [SM 8 4] [SM 9 3]] becomes [SM 2 [SM 9 3]].

[SM 9 3] gives us 2, because 9 + 3 equals 12 and 'sum modulo 10' of 12 is 2.
So, [SM 2 [SM 9 3]] becomes [SM 2 2].

Lastly, [SM 2 2] gives us 4, because 2 + 2 equals 4 and 'sum modulo 10' of 4 is 4.

Now, coming back to the initial expression, we replace the solved parts to get [SM 1 4].
Finally, [SM 1 4] gives us 5, because 1 + 4 equals 5 and 'sum modulo 10' of 5 is 5.

Now, use the results from above to solve the next level:

MIN [SM 5 0] [MIN 3 5] = MIN 5 3 = 3

SM [SM 0 2] [SM 5 8] = SM 2 3 = 5

[SM 0 9] and [SM 2 4] — the ""SM"" operator stands for sum modulo 10. The sum of 0 and 9 is 9, and the sum of 2 and 4 is 6. However, since we're asked for the sum modulo 10, we just take the last digit of the sum, which means [SM 0 9] = 9 and [SM 2 4] = 6.
