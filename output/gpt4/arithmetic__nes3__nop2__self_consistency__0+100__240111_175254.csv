Now to the third innermost parenthesis:

And last innermost operation:
-48 - 53 = -101. Apply modulo rules because it’s a negative number, -101 modulo -100 = -1.

Let's redo the values of the expression using these calculated values:
(((89+59)*(-87+68))-((53--41)+(63*79))) becomes ((48 * -19)-(94+77)).
