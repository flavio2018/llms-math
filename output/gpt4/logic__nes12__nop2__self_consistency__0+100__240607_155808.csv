A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, remember that from De Morgan's laws in logic, we have
- F|!T = False since anything OR not-True is False
- F|T = True since anything OR True is True
- T&T = T since True and True is True

Now simplify the formula step-by-step:

- (w|F) = w since anything OR False is just the original value
- (F|(!T))|(!(F|T)) = F since we have False OR not-True or not-True
- (w|((w|((F|(!T))|(!(F|T))))|(w&(!T)))) = w since we only get False OR not-True along with other w, which will be dominated by w
- ((w&((F|(T&T))|T))|w) = w since we get True inside, and anything AND True will be the original value, which is w, and OR w is still w
- ((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|(!T))|(!(F|T))))|(w&(!T))))&T)|w))&((w&((F|(T&T))|T))|w))&(F|T)) simplifies to (w&w&w) which equals to w

The second half of your expression, ""o & (b & F)"" will always be False because the logical AND of anything with False is False. So,  ""!(o & (b&F))"" simplifies to ""T"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the expression within the innermost brackets by applying the following logical laws:

- Nothing AND true is nothing. (A & T = A)
- Nothing OR false is nothing.  (A | F = A)
- Not false is true. (!F = T)

We start by replacing all the (u | F) and (a | F) pairs by u and a respectively, because something OR false is always that thing. 
Also, we replace (a & T) by a and (u & T) by u, because something AND true is always that thing. 

In addition, any (F | F) pair is F, because false OR false is always false, and any part of the formula with AND false (like u & F) is automatically false because something AND false is always false. 

According to the law of idempotence of logical and (A&A = A), (a&a) can be simplified to a, also (u&u) to u.

So, simplifying step-by-step:

((a&a)&((((u|(((u|((u&(u&(!F)))|F))|u)|u))&((((a&((((a&T)&T)|F)&T))|T)|T)|T))|(u|F))&(F|F)))

= (a&((u|u)&(a|T)&F))

   ((((T&F)|(((T|F)&F)&(((((((b&T)&(T&T))&(!T))&T)&F)|(((!T)&F)|F))&F))|F)|((T|F)|T))

2. Any variable and True (T&T) or a variable (which can be either true or false) and itself (variable&variable) and variable 'b' and True is variable 'b' itself:
   Which simplifies (T&T) to T and (b&T) to b - ((T&T) -> T, (b&T) -> b)

3. Logical NOT is an operator that switches a true operand to false and vice versa:

   Thus:
   ((((T&F)|(((T|F)&F)&(((((((b&F)&(T)&(!T))&T)&F)|(((!T)&F)|F))&F))|F)|((T|F)|T))

4. Simplify (((T|F)&F) -> F):

5. Also, since True or False is always True (T|F -> T), and True or True is True (T|T -> T):
   we simplify ((T|F) -> T, (T|T) -> T):
   ((((T&F)|((F)&(((((((b&F)&(T)&(F))&T)&F)|((F)&F)|F))&F))|F)|(T))

- We have F or F gives F, and a or a gives a. Also, a AND'ed with itself gives a. a AND'ed with True gives a: (F|(((T)&(!(h&((c|(((a&(a))|a)) & F))))))).
- Anything AND'ed with True is itself: (F|(((!(h&((c|(((a&(a))|a)) & F))))))).

5. m & m simplifies to m.
6. m & F simplifies to False as ""anything AND False"" is always False.

1) '(f|f)' is just 'f', '(((b|b)|b))' is just 'b', '(T|(T|(F&(T|T))))' is just 'T'.

2) '(F&((b|b)|b)&F)' and '(F&F)' are both just 'F' because False AND anything is always False.

3) So, '(u|(F&(((b|b)|b)&F)))' becomes 'u', '(u|(F&F))' becomes 'u'. 

4) So, '((u|(((u|(F&(((b|b)|b)&F)))|(!(T))))))|(u|F))' becomes '(u|(!T))|u' which simplifies to 'u|F' and further simplifies to 'u'.

5) The whole expression '(((F&F)|F)&F)|T' simplifies to 'F|T' which further simplifies to 'T'.

6) So, '((((F&F)|F)&F)|T)&(T&((u|(((u|(F&(((b|b)|b)&F)))|(!(T))))))|(u|F)))' simplifies to 'T&T&u' which simplifies to 'T&u' and further simplifies to 'u'.

7) Hence, the entire expression simplifies to '(f&u).

Therefore, ((f|f)&(((((F&F)|F)&F)|T)&(T&((u|(((u|(F&(((b|b)|b)&F)))|(!(T|(T|(F&(T|T))))))|(u|F)))|T))) simplifies to '(f&u)'.",(f&u),f

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, we can simplify (T&(T|T)) to just T, because it's true that true AND true is true. So we get this:

((k|(k&((((k&T)))&((k|(((F|(F&T))&T)|(((k|k)&k)&F)))|k))|(k&T))&k)))|(!((F&(T&T))&F)).

Next, (F&(T&T)) simplifies to F, because the AND operator takes the value of the least true operand, which is false. So the formula becomes:

((k|(k&((((k&T)))&((k|(((F|(F&T))&T)|(((k|k)&k)&F)))|k))|(k&T))&k)))|(!(F)).

The simplification of (!(F)) gives us T. So the formula is simplified to:

((k|(k&((((k&T)))&((k|(((F|(F&T))&T)|(((k|k)&k)&F)))|k))|(k&T))&k)))|T.

The OR operator (|) takes the value of the most true operand, so when we have OR (|) with true (T), the result is always true (T). Therefore, everything inside the first overall parenthesis does not matter and the result will be true. Thus, the whole expression simplifies to:

3. Recognize F|A = A and A|A = A in the formula:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first thing to notice is T&T = T and F&F = F (principles of identity and nullity for logical ""and"").
We also have T|F = T, T|(j|T) = T and i|(i&(i|i)) = i (principles of domination, identity and idempotent for logical ""or"").
Finally, k&k = k (principle of idempotent for logical ""and"").
Your expression becomes:
((c&T)&c) & (c | (!((k | T | T | T) | T | F | T) & T))

Next, let's simplify this further.
c&T  is equal to c (since 'T' represents 'true' in logical operations, and anything AND true remains same)
T|T is equal to T (the logical 'or' operation with 'true' will always result in 'true'.)
k | T is equal to T (the logical 'or' operation with 'true' will always result in 'true'.)
So, your expression becomes:
c & c & (c | !((T | F | T) & T))

Again, in a logical operation, 'T' OR 'F' = 'T' . 
((T | F | T) & T) = (T & T) = T
So, your expression becomes:
c & c & (c | !(T))

In logical operations, the ""not"" operation will change the current form. 
!(T) = F
So, the expression becomes 
c & c & (c | F) 

Now, we know that T & T = T, using similar logic, c & c = c. Also, the logical 'or' operation with 'false' will result as is (i.e. c|F = c)
So, the expression becomes
c & c 

Finally, using the idempotence property of 'and' function, the simplified expression should be:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: Simplify double negatives, knowing that !(!A) is equivalent to A, we find ((F|(T|(F|((T|(T&(!(!(t&F)))))|F))...)
to be the same as ((F|(T|(F|((T|(T&(t&F)))|F))...)

Step 2: Start breaking down internal statements. 

First, look at (t&F). In an AND logical operation, if any statement is false, the whole operation is false, so this simplifies to F. Thus we get:

((F|(T|(F|((T|(T&F))|F))...)

Then, look at (T&(t&F)). Same as before, this simplifies to F, so we have:

((F|(T|(F|((T|F)|F))...)

Then, look at (T|F). In an OR operation, if any statement is true, the whole operation is true, so this simplifies to T, so we have:

((F|(T|(F|(T|F)))...)

Step 3: Follow the operations. 

(T|F) simplifies to T. (T|F) simplifies to T. (F|T) simplifies to T. 

So far, our expression has become:

(T|(!((F|(T&((F&(F|(w&F))&T)&F)))|T))

Step 4: Simplify the other side of the OR operation.

In (T&((F&(F|(w&F))&T)&F)),  (w&F) simplifies to F. So it becomes (T&((F&(F|F)&T)&F)). Which simplifies to (T&((F&F&T)&F)), and as there are multiple F in an AND operation, it simplifies to F.

So, our expression is now:

(T|(!(F|T))

Step 5: Simplify the last operation. 

Since (F|T) simplifies to T, and !(T) simplifies to F.

The expression is now:

(T|F)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F&T is False as False AND anything is always False. So we can eliminate this. 

2. F|T is True, as anything OR True is always True. Also, T|F is True for the same reason.

3. So, now equation in simpler terms becomes: t&(f|T)&T&t&T|(d&!d)&T.

4. Anything AND True doesn't change the value of that thing, so simplify T&T&T to just T.

5. Then the equation further simplifies to: t&f|T&t&T|(d&!d).

6. Not of anything (here d) is just the opposite of that thing (here d), means !d = not d. So, d AND not d becomes False as True and False is False, and False and True is also False.

7. Now, the equation becomes: t&f|T&t&T|F.

8. Next, we know False OR anything doesn't change the value of that thing. Hence, t&f|T&T.

Similarly, ""any expression and-ed with False gives False as result""
""any expression and-or True gives True as result""
""any expression or-ed with False gives the other operand as result""
Applying these rules:
(((((F)&F)&(!((!((F|(T|T|T|T))))|(!T))&(F)))&(w&F)).

Apply this rule ->

This simplifies to ->

Since ""any expression and-ed with False gives False as result"" ->

4. Let's simplify that part: ((((i&T)&(F)))|T)|T). Regardless of the truth value of i, T & i (True and i) will result in i. However, since we're taking a logical and with False, the result of i, doesn't matter, you will get False. And with logical or against T, this will result in True.

   `!((!(F|T))|F)` -> `!((!T)|F)` ->`!((F)|F)` -> `!F` -> `T`
   `!(F&F)` -> `!F` -> `T`
   Hence, we immediately can simplify our formula to: 
   `(T&(!(F&(b|(w|T)|((j&(p&(p&T))&F))&((F&(T|T)|F)&F)))))`.

2. In logical or (`|`), if one of the operands is `True`, then the whole operation is `True`:
   `w|T` -> `T`; `T|T` -> `T`

   `(T&(!(F&(b|T|((j&(p&T)&F))&F))))`.

4. Next, knowing that `True and X` equals to `X` for any `X`, we simplify:
   `(T&(!(F&(b|T|j&F))))`.

5. Again, taking `False and X` equals to `False` for any `X`:
   `(T&(!(F&(b|T|F))))`.

Also, we note (!T) equals F and (!F) equals T. 

Logical OR between any value and T (x|T) and logical AND between any value and F (x&F) are absorption operations. That is, (x|T) equals T and (x&F) equals F.

4. Any term ORed with False (x|F) equals to the term itself (i.e. x|F = x).

6. Any term ORed with itself (x|x) equals to the term itself (i.e. x|x = x).
7. Any term ANDed with itself (x&x) equals to the term itself (i.e. x&x = x).

((((((((((x|(x&x))|((x|x)&x))|(!T))&(!F))&F)|F)|T)&(T|(l|(T|(T|T)))))|(T|T))&T))

Simplify from the inner most bracket:

x|(x&x) - This can be simplified as x

Simplify (x|x)&x - This can be simplified as x

Simplify (x|(!T)) - Since, (!T) is False, hence it can be simplified as x

Simplify ((x)&(!F)) - Since, (!F) is True, hence it can be simplified as x

Simplify (x&F) - x&F is False

Simplify False OR False as False

So, now you are with False OR True AND with (True OR l OR True OR True OR True OR True). Using identity 2, you can simplify entire bracketed part (True OR l OR True OR True OR True OR True) as True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can eliminate the ""and"" and ""or"" operations where the second operand is a constant True (T) or False (F) value:

Since any value or'ed with False (n | F) remains the value itself (n).
Any value and'ed with True (n & T) remains the value itself (n).

So, we can simplify to:

((n&n)&(h|((F|(o&o&F)&T)|!(F&(F&F&(F|F&T)&T)|F))))

Now let's continue simplifying:

Any value and'ed with itself (n & n) remains the value itself (n).
Any value or'ed with False (F|(o&o&F)) is False because o&o&F will always be False.

This gives us:

(n&(h|((F&T)|!(F&(F&F&(F&T)&T)|F))))

Then, we apply that any value anded with False (F & T) results in False, and that the negation of False (!F) is True.

We obtain:

(n&(h|(T|True)))

Finally, True or any other value will always be True:

(n&(h|True))

So, since any value and'ed with True remains the original value:

(n&h)

So, the simplified formula is (n&h).",(n&h),n

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, any statement &'d with F is false. Therefore, the sub-formula (F&T) in the last brackets will be false (because False & True is False), which makes the whole formula False.

However, we will still go through the remaining part of the formula step-by-step to understand the process:

1. (!F): This is the logical negation of False, which is True.
2. (F&F): This is False, because both terms are False.
3. (v&v): This is simply 'v'. If 'v' is True, then it is True, if 'v' is False, then it would be False.
4. (v|(v|(v&v))): This becomes simply (v|v|v), which is v.
5. (x&T): This is x, because True & 'x' is always 'x' (assuming 'x' is a boolean).
6. ((x&T)&x): This is the same as (x&x) because x and True is x again, so it simplifies to just x.
7. (((x&T)&x)&F): This is False, because x & False = False.
8. (((v|(v|((v&v)|(F&F))))&(((x&T)&x)&F))&(!F)): This becomes (v&F)&True or False & True, which simplifies to False.
9. (((a|(F|(a&(T|(T|T))))&(f|(!(((v|(v|((v&v)|(F&F))))&(((x&T)&x)&F))&(!F)))))): This simplifies to (a|False)&(f|False), which simplifies further to a&f.

Combining everything, the original expression simplifies to ""((!F)&(((a|F)|((a&(T|(T|T)))&(f|(!(((v|(v|((v&v)|(F&F))))&(((x&T)&x)&F))&(!F))))))&(F&T))"", which simply results in False logically.

2. Anything OR with False (F) is itself - i.e., X | F = X. So, we can simplify both (f | F) and (d | F) to f and d respectively.
3. Anything OR with True (T) is True - i.e., X | T = T. So, we can simplify (F | T) to T.

2. T&F and F&T are both F again, so we simplify it to:
(!((((((((t|F)|(F|(T&F)))&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)|(F&(T|(!F)))))).

3. T|F and F|T both simplify to T, so the formula simplifies to:
(!((((((((t|T))|(T&F))&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)|F))) -The symbol ""|"" means ""or"" so any expression OR true will always be true

4. T&F simplifies to F, so the formula simplifies to:
(!(((((((t)|(F))&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)|F)))

5. t|F simplifies to t (because any expression or False is the expression itself), so the formula simplifies to:
(!((((((t)&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)|F)))

6. t&T and T&t simplifies to t (since anything AND true is the expression itself), so the formula becomes:

7. But t&F and F&t simplifies to F (any expression AND false is false), so the formula simplifies to:

- (T|F)|F also equals True because (True OR False) OR False is True.
- T&F equals False because True AND False is False.
- F&T equals False because False AND True is False.
- F&F equals False because False AND False is False.
- T|F equals True because True OR False is True.

- T|anything equals True because True or anything is the same as True.

Also, NOT true (!T) gives false, and NOT false (!F) gives true.

Any value T OR T is always true, and any value T AND T is also always true.

The NOT operator negates the value that follows it, any value ""x | !x"" is always true.

Considering these principles:

((g&g)&((b|(((b|((u|(h|(F|(T|T))))|(!(T|(!((v&T)|(T|T)))))))|T)|((T&(!F))|F)))|(F&(T&T)))) simplifies to:

((g&g)&((b|(((b|((u|(h|(F|(T))))|(!(T|(!(v&T)))))|T)|((T&(!F))|F)))|(F&(T))))

Then:

((g&g)&((b|(((b|((u|(h|(T|(T))))|(!(T|(!v&T))))))|T)|((T&(!F))|F)))|(F&(T))))

Because any value OR T (x | T) is always true;

and NOT T (!T) is false, and x AND false (x & F) is always false.

So, we can simplify it to:

((g&g)&((b|(((b|(T))|T))|T))|(F&T))

Then:

3. |F is the identity function (it does not change the value). Therefore, i|i|F will simplify to i|i, which is simply i. 

4. !F is always True. So, !(F&((((z|z)|T)&F)&((!((F&T)|(T&T)))|T))) will simplify to !(F) which is T.

Therefore, `(((r|r)&r)|F)` is just `((r&r)&r)` , simplifying we have `r`.

2) Any value AND False is False. Thus, `(v&F)` is actually `F`. Similarly, `((n&(T&(T&F)))&T)` simplifies to `(n&F)&T` which is `F&T` so it is `F`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The provided statement seems quite large, but this task is doable step by step as follows:

1. The first step is to simplify some base logical operations, especially those where we have defined logical values T and F.

2. (T&F), (T|F), (T|T), (F|T), (F|F) and (F&F) = (T|T) can be simplified to T, (T | F) to T, and (F | T) is also T, (F) & T can be simplified to F, (F)&F = F

3. (((f&((((((f|f)&T)|F)&T)&f)|(!((p|((((T|T)|F)&(T|(T&T)))&T))&T))))&(F|(T|T)))|F)&((!T)|T) - Calculated in point 2

4. A logical or operation with two identical terms, as (x|x), where x represents an arbitrary literal, will always yield the same value as the initial one, hence, it can be simplified to x. The operation (f|f) can hence be simplified to f.

5. For the AND operation (!T), it is equivalent to F because the NOT operator reverses the value of T to F. 

6. Negation of F is T according to the logic rule.

7. If any part of an AND operation includes F, it equals F. If any part of an OR operation includes T, it equals T.

8. Let's start implementing these simplifications:

((((f&((f&T)&f)|(!((p&T)&T))))&T)|F)&(F|T)

Step 1 to 8 give us: 

= (((f&f)&f)|(p&T)&T)|F&T.

   - We know that T | anything (including unknown variables or constants) or anything | T, is always true (since it means anything OR true, which must be true). So T | ((g & F) | F) simplifies to T. This gives us T & T.

   - Likewise, we have F | ((T & T) & T) which simplifies to F since anything OR false is always equal to anything. Therefore, F | ((T & T) & T) is equal to F.

   - And, any variable AND false or false AND any variable always gives us False so ((g & F) | F) is equal to F.

3. At this point, your formula simplifies to ((T & T) & ((!(((e | False) & T) | F) | (False & F)) & T).

4. However, we know that anything AND false (including unknown variables or constants) is false. Therefore, (False & F), simplifies to F.

5. Also, T & T is always true, i.e. True. So we simplify your formula again to (T & ((!(((e | False) & T) | F) | F) & T)).

6. We simplify ((e | False) & T) to (e & T) because e OR false is always equal to e.

7. The final simplified form would be ((T & ((!(e & T) | F) & T)) which simplifies to (T & (!e & T)).",(T & (!e & T)),T

2. Replacing this full expression with T, we get ""F&T"", which is always false (F).
3. The next item is ""T&F"", which is F again because AND operation with one False operand yields False. The rest of the expression becomes ""T|T"", which is T, because OR operation with at least one True operand yields True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First off, in Boolean logic, anything ORed with True will return True, so we can already simplify ((b|(b&b))|T)|T) to T. 

As for (!(f|(T&((T|T)&)) let’s break it down a bit.

The logical OR operator (|) returns True if either or both of its two operands are true and False otherwise. So, (T|T) simplifies to T. 

The logical AND operator (&) returns True if both operands are True and False otherwise. Therefore, (T&T), (T&any boolean variable) and (F&any boolean variable) would simplify to T, F, and F, respectively.

The logical NOT operator (!) returns True if the operand is False, and it returns False if the operand is True. So, (!T) simplifies to F.

If we substitute these simplified forms back into the original formula, we get:
(!(f|(T&(T&(F|F|F))))|T)

Now, if we simplify (F|F|F), we get F because ORing any boolean variable with F gives the boolean variable itself, in this case, F.
(!(f|(T&(T&F)))|T)

The expression (T&F) simplifies to F, giving us:
(!(f|F)|T)

(f|F) simplifies to True, so now we have:
(!T|T)

And the expression (!T|T) gives us True at last.

So the simplified form of ((!(f|(T&((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&((!T)&F))))|((T&(y|(T|((!T)&(F|F)))))|F))))))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T)) is True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we'll simplify the inner expressions:

- !(T | x) = !T = F because T or anything is always T and not T is false
- F | (!T|F) = F | F = F because !T = F and F or anything = exactly that thing
- a | T = T (anything or True is always True)
- n & F = F (anything and False is always False)
- w | F = w (anything or False is exactly that thing)

Keeping these in mind, substitution into the formula gives us something like:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify the part of the expression which has truth values (T and F) and operators because Truth values (T and F) with operators will be simplified to either T or F.

Noting that:

1) ""F&anything"" or ""anything&F"" = F: since False AND anything is always False.
2) ""T|anything"" or ""anything|T""  = T: since True OR anything is always True.
3) ""!F"" = T and ""!T"" = F : since NOT operation changes a value to its opposite.

Let's apply these simplification rules to the expression:

1) ""F&(T&F)"" = false because of rule 1.
2) So ""F|(F&(T&F))"" = ""F|F"" = false since anything or-ed with F stays as it is and F|F = F
3) So ""!F|(F&(T&F))"" = ""!F"" = T, using rule 3.
4) ""T&T"" = T, since true AND true is true
5) So ""(T&T)&F"" = ""T&F"" = F, using rule 1 and step 4.
6) ""F&T"" = ""T&F"" = F, using rule 1.
7) So ""(((x&T)|(x|x))&x)"" = ""((x)&x)"" = x, as (x or x) =x.
8) Hence, ""((((x&T)|(x|x))&x)|((F&T)&T))"" = ""(x|F)"" = x, using step 7 and rule 2.
9) Thus, ""((T&T)&F)|(((((x&T)|(x|x))&x)|((F&T)&T))|T)"" = ""F|x|T"" = T, using step 8 and rule 2.
10) Therefore, ""(i&(!(F|(F&(T&F)))))|(i|((i&(i|((((T&T)&F)|(((((x&T)|(x|x))&x)|((F&T)&T))|T))&(T&T))))|i))"" = (i&T)|(i|(i|i)) = (i)|(i) = i.",i,i

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Subexpression ""(F|(T|(!T)))"" simplifies to T. This is because the operation ""T|(!T)"" resolves to True and therefore the whole subexpression resolves to ""(F|T)"" which is always True.

2. In turn, since '!' is a negation operator - the subexpression ""(!T)"" will resolve to False. 

3. If we apply these findings to the given expression, we simplify it to:
""((!T|T)&T)&(w&h&F&j&((!(!T))&T)|(T&(T&(!((F&T)&(!T))))))"".

4. Now we see that expression ""(!((F&T)&(!T)))"" resolves to True, because the inner part ""(F&T)&(!T)"" is False and its negation is True. Also ""(!T)"" is False. 

5. ""(F&((j&((!(!T))&T))|(T&(T&(!((F&T)&(!T)))))))"" simplifies to ""(F&((j&T)|(T&T)))"" which is ""(F&j&T)"". Since the logical and operation for False and anything is always False, we can simplify this to ""F"". 

6. Then second part of the main expression can be simplified to: ""(!((w&h&F)))&F"", which is ""(!F)&F"". But the logical and of anything and False is always False.

7. So, the entire expression has been simplified to ""((!T|T)&T)&F"". 

8. Since the logical or between something and its negation is always True, ""(T|!T)"" is True so ""((!T|T)&T)"" is ""T&T"", which is True.

9. Thus, the entire expression simplifies to ""T&F"" - this is False.

5. p|T is always T, regardless of the value of p.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's break down the formula according to the semantics of logic:

1. Any value OR False is equal to the original value. So, (s|F) simplifies to s.
(F|(((l|F)|T)&F)) simplifies to F, because anything ORed with True equals True and anything ANDed with False equals False.

2. Not True or Not anything equals to the negation of True, which is False. Therefore, (!(T|!F)) simplifies to F.

3. (z&(z&z))&T equals to z, because if z is True, that statement will be True, whereas if z is False, that will make it False.

4. Anything ANDed with True remains unchanged. So, ((z&(z&z))&T)|T equals to T because anything ORed with True equals True

5. (p & ((j & (j|j) | T)) | T) equals to T, because anything ORed with True is True.

6. Finally F&False equals to False, and therefore anything ANDed with False equals False.

Therefore, the simplified formula is s | (F | F) & T, which by applying the same rules further simplifies to s | F & T, which simplifies even further to s | F, which finally simplifies to s (since anything ORed with False is the original value).",s,s

2. Next the statement is: ((x&(F|(F&((v|(!(y&F)))&(!((F&(T&F))&F))))))&(((!((!T)|T))&T)&T)).
3. Now we got an inner most logic and statement: (T&F) gives F.
4. After this the formula turns into: ((x&(F|(F&((v|(!(y&F)))&(!((F&F)&F))))))&(((!((!T)|T))&T)&T)).
5. Now we got an inner most logic and statement: (F&F) gives F.

19. Now rewriting the final logic and statement: F&((T&T)&T) gives F (as any logical and operation with False results in False).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we will simplify the inner most parentheses using the idea that T OR anything is always T, F AND anything is always F, and T AND anything is always that thing. So:

    ((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)

    becomes:

    ((w|(w|((w|F)|(w&((!(q&T))|(T&u))))))&T) | T

2. Next, we know that F OR anything is always that thing, and x AND x is always x. Let's apply these rules:

    ((w|(w|((w|F)|(w&((!(q&T))|(T&u))))))&T) | T

    becomes:

    ((w|(w|(w|(w&(!(q&T)||u))))&T) | T

    ==>

    ((w|(w&w&(w&(!(q&T)||u)))) | T

    ==>

    ((w|w&(w&(!(q&T)||u)))) | T

3. Now, we can simplify further using De Morgan’s laws, which state that the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations and the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations. Also, according to distributive laws, A and (B or C) is the same as (A and B) or (A and C), i.e., and operation distributes over or, and similarly, A or (B and C) is the same as (A or B) and (A or C), i.e., or operation distributes over and.

    ((w|w&(w&(!(q&T)||u)))) | T

    becomes:

    T

Starting with
((F&(((e|((e|((e|(e|e))|((((e&e)|e)|(t&(T&F)))|F)))|F))|F)&F))&((T|(T&(!(y&((T&T)&F)))))|F))). 

Let's simplify it:

- (t&(T&F)) becomes F, because and operation with False results in False.
- (e&(e&e)) becomes e by applying idempotency law. This law states that conjunction (and operation) of a variable with itself will result into that variable.
- (e|(e|e)) becomes e by applying idempotency law. This law states that disjunction (or operation) of a variable with itself will result into that variable.
- ((e|e)|(F&((…)|F)|F)) simplifies to e.
- (e&F) becomes F, because and operation with False results in False.
- (F&F) simplifies to F, because and operation with False results in False.
   
So, the given formula simplifies to
(F&F)&(T|(T&(!(y&F))|F))
- !(y&F) simplifies to T because y and False is Always False and the negation of False is True.
- (T|(T&T)|F) simplifies to T.

1. !T = F
2. !F = T

Then, let's simplify any term with logical AND (&);

1. X & F = F 
2. X & T = X 
3. F & X = F 
4. T & X = X

Where X is any literal value.

Next, we simplify any term with logical OR (|).

1. X | F = X 
2. X | T = T 
3. F | X = X 
4. T | X = T

Finally, applying these rules to your formula we get:
