((y|(y|y))&(y|(y&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula is ((y|(y|y))&(y|(y&T))).

Start by examining the clause (y|y|y). 'Or' operation is idempotent, meaning that y|y is equal to 'y'. So this clause simplifies to 'y'.

Now, look at the clause (y|(y&T)). 'And' operation with True value doesn't change the value of the other parameter. So, y&T is equal to 'y'. Therefore, this clause simplifies to (y|y), which again by idempotence of 'Or' operation is 'y'.
  
So the entire formula simplifies to (y & y), which by idempotence of 'And' operation equals to 'y'. 

Therefore, ((y|(y|y))&(y|(y&T))) simplifies to 'y'.",y,y

(((c&c)|T)&(l&(T&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify (c&c) which is simply 'c', because any literal AND with itself is simply itself.

Next, '(Literal or T)' is always T, regardless of the value of the Literal, which means (c|T) is T.

So now, the statement is reduced to '(T&(l&(T&F)))'.

Next, '(Literal AND False)' is always False irrespective of the literal. So '(T&F)' simplifies to F. 

Now the statement is '(T&(l&F))', which is same as '(T&F)', which simplifies to F.

So the given logic formula simplifies to F.",F,F

((q&q)|((q|q)|(q|F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, (q&q) = q. A thing and itself is equivalent to the thing itself.

Next, (q|q) = q. The or operation of a thing with itself results in the thing itself.

So, (q|F) = q. This is so because or operation of q with False yields q itself.

Therefore, ((q&q)|((q|q)|(q|F))) simplifies finally to (q|q|q) which again simplifies to q, following the same logic as above.",q,q

(((!F)&T)&(o|(T&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we have (!F) means not False, which is True (T). So the expression becomes ((T&T)&(o|(T&T))). 

Second, the T&T always evaluates to True (T), simplifying the expression to ((T)&(o|T)). 

Third, anything or True ( ""o|T"" ) always evaluates to True (T), and the final expression simplifies to (T&T), 

which ultimately simplifies to True (T).",T,T
