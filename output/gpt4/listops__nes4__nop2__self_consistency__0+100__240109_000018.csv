- [SM 0 9] is also 0, because (0 + 9) mod 10 equals 9.
- [MAX 0 6] is 6, because the maximum number between 0 and 6 is 6.

So, the expression1 becomes: MAX [MAX 4 3] [MIN [SM 4 4] [MAX 8 1]]

STEP 2: Solve the SM operation: [SM 4 4] = 8 (because 4+4 = 8).
So, the expression1 becomes: MAX [MAX 4 3] [MIN 8 [MAX 8 1]]

STEP 3: Solve the MAX operation: [MAX 8 1] = 8 (because 8 is larger than 1).
So, the expression1 becomes: MAX [MAX 4 3] [MIN 8 8]

STEP 4: Solve the MAX operation: [MAX 4 3] = 4 (because 4 is larger than 3).
So, the expression1 becomes: MAX 4 [MIN 8 8]

STEP 5: Solve the MIN operation: [MIN 8 8] = 8 (because 8 is equal to 8).
So, the expression1 becomes: MAX 4 8

STEP 6: Solve the MAX operation: [MAX 4 8] = 8 (because 8 is larger than 4).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the SM operations:
SM 8 0 = 8, SM 9 8 = 7 (since 9+8 = 17, modulo 10 = 7) and SM 9 2 = 1 (since 9+2 = 11, modulo 10 =1).

So the expression becomes:
[MIN [MAX [SM 8 [MIN 4 4]] [MIN [MIN 0 1] [MIN 7 2]]] [MAX [MIN 7 [MAX 9 4]] [MAX [MIN 4 4] 1]]].

Then, calculate the MIN operations:
MIN 4 4 = 4, MIN 0 1 = 0, MIN 7 2 = 2, so we get:
[MIN [MAX 8 0] [MAX 7 [MAX 4 1]]].

Which simplifies to:
[MIN [MAX 8 0] [MAX 7 4]].

Then, calculate the MAX operations:
MAX 8 0 = 8, MAX 7 4 = 7, so the final expression is:
MIN 8 7.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, evaluate the SM operations:

SM[2 8] = (2+8) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0
SM[4 7] = (4+7) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
SM[6 5] = (6+5) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
SM[1 9] = (1+9) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0
SM[5 3] = (5+3) mod 10 = 8
SM[(MAX 2 0)] = (2) = 2
SM[(MAX 1 1)] = (1) = 1

Substitute these values back into the equation. We currently have:

MAX [MIN [0 1] [1 0]] [SM [MIN [8] [7]] [3]]

Now, proceed with the MIN and MAX operations:

MIN[0 1] = 0
MIN[8 7] = 7
MIN[1 0] = 0
MAX[0 1] = 1

Substitute these values back into the equation. We currently have:

MAX [0] [SM [7] [1 1]]

Our expression becomes [MAX [SM [MIN 1 2] [SM 3 6]] [MIN [SM 4 2] [SM 4 6]]].

Our expression becomes [MAX [SM 1 9] [MIN 6 0]].

MIN [MIN 3 0] = 0.
The smallest number between 3 and 0 is 0.

SM 1 5 = 6.
1+5=6.

MIN 3 4 = 3.
The smallest number between 3 and 4 is 3.

MAX 6 7 = 7.

MAX 5 7 = 7.
The largest number between 5 and 7 is 7.

SM 8 3 = 1.

MAX 1 4 = 4.
The largest number between 1 and 4 is 4.

MIN 7 1 = 1.
The smallest number between 7 and 1 is 1.

MAX [MIN 0 7] [MIN 4 1].

Further solving gives:

MIN 0 7 = 0.
The smallest number between 0 and 7 is 0.

MIN 4 1 = 1.
The smallest number between 4 and 1 is 1.

Our final expression is:
