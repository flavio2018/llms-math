A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the innermost brackets:

[MIN 7 5 7] = 5 (since the minimum of 7, 5, and 7 is 5)

[MIN 9 7 1] = 1 (since the minimum of 9, 7, and 1 is 1)

[SM 9 9 3] = 1 (since the sum of 9, 9, and 3 modulo 10 is 1)

[SM [SM 5 4 0] [MAX 6 9 5] 2] = [SM [SM 9] [MAX 6 9 5] 2] = [SM [SM 9] 9 2] = [SM 9 2] = 1 (the sum of 5, 4, and 0 modulo 10 is 9, the maximum of 6, 9, and 5 is 9, and the sum of 9, 9 and 2 modulo 10 is 1)

[SM 0 5 7] is 0 + 5 + 7 modulo 10 = 2.

Step 3: Again Evaluate the inner most operation.

   Here are those operations:

Step 4: Replace these operations and their final results in the incomplete evaluated expression.

   After inserting the final results, our expression will be:

[MAX 7 0 1] = max(7, 0, 1) = 7

[MAX 2 9 7] = max(2, 9, 7) = 9

[MAX 9 0 0] = max(9, 0, 0) = 9

Now we substitute these values back into the main expression:

[SM [MIN [MAX 9 0 7] [SM 8 8 0] 1] [MIN [MIN 7 0 7] 0 [MAX 9 9]] 9]

We now need to solve these new lists:

Compute the next layer inside the brackets:

SM [SM 0 3 3] = SM [6] = 6.
SM [SM 2 9 2] = SM [13] = 3.
SM [SM 8 8 4] = SM [20] = 0.

Moving next to MIN: 

MIN [MIN 0 2 8] = 0.
MIN [MAX 0 7 3] = 0.
MIN [9 6 9] = 6.

So, our updated expression becomes [SM 9 [MIN [MAX 7 0 1] [MIN 2 0 6] 1] [SM 9 [SM 4 [MAX 1 5 8] 6] [SM 3 0 9]]].

Continuing with MIN:

MIN [MAX 7 0 1] =  MIN [7] = 7.
MIN [2 0 6] = 0.

Update our expression again and we get [SM 9 [MIN 7 0 1] [SM 9 [SM 4 [MAX 1 5 8] 6] [SM 3 0 9]]].

Calculate the last MIN and that gives us 0

Our expression is [SM 9 0 [SM 9 [SM 4 [MAX 1 5 8] 6] [SM 3 0 9]]].

As a final step, let's compute the remaining MAX operations:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to compute all inner-most brackets:
[MIN 6 1 5] => The minimum between 6,1,5 is 1
[SM 1 6 7] => We need to add all the numbers and take the result modulo 10. 1+6+7=14, and 14 modulo 10 is 4.
So [SM [MIN 6 1 5] 4 [SM 1 6 7]] = SM [1 4 4]

[SM 3 6 4] => Again, we need to add all the numbers and take the result modulo 10. 3+6+4=13, and 13 modulo 10 is 3.
[MIN 3 4 4] => The minimum between 3,4,4 is 3.
So [SM [SM 3 6 4] 6 [MIN 3 4 4]] = SM [3 6 3]

To SIMD [1 4 4] and [3 6 3] we again add all the numbers and take the modulo 10. In both cases we get: 1+4+4=9, 9 mod 10 = 9, and 3+6+3=12, 12 mod 10=2.

So, the first part of the equation MIN [4 SM 9 2] = MIN [4 9 2] results in 2, because 2 is the minimum.

For the second part, we do the same process, compute the inner-most brackets first:
[MIN 2 7 7] => The minimum between 2,7,7 is 2
[MAX 8 6 6] => The maximum between 8,6,6 is 8.
So [SM [MIN 2 7 7] 8 [MAX 8 6 6]] = SM [2 8 8] => 2+8+8 = 18 => 18 mod 10 = 8.

[SM 6 2 8] => 6 + 2 + 8 = 16 mod 10 = 6
[MAX 5 4 9] => The maximum between 5,4,9 is 9.

So, the second part of the equation is:

MAX 0 4 3 gives us 4
SM 2 7 5 gives us 4 (because 2+7+5 = 14, and 14 mod 10 = 4)
MIN 0 5 2 gives us 0 (because the minimum value is 0)

MAX 4 5 4 gives us 5
MIN 0 8 3 gives us 0 (because the minimum value is 0)
MIN 2 0 5 gives us 0 (because the minimum value is 0)

[MIN 7 8 4] = min(7, 8, 4) = 4,

So we replace these values in expression:

Continue:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First we calculate all MAX and MIN operators from inside. 
    - MAX operators:
      - [MAX 1 1 1] = 1
      - [MAX 2 1 2] = 2
      - [MAX 3 2 6] = 6
      - [MAX 0 7 4] = 7

2. Then we calculate all SM operators.
    - We have sums 6 + 4 + 8 = 18 = 8 (modulo 10)
    - 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 = 1 (modulo 10)
    - 0 + 3 + 5 = 8
    - 8 + 2 + 1 = 1 (modulo 10)

    - After summing up, we get:

3. Now we have only MAX operators left inside.

- [MAX 3 3 9] results in 9.
- [SM 3 7 6] results in (3+7+6) modulo 10 = 6.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we will break down this expression into smaller parts.

The first part we will calculate is [MAX 9 5 5], which equals 9, since 9 is the maximum number.
Similarly, for [MIN 3 9 9], the minimum number is 3.
Therefore, [SM [MAX 9 5 5] [MIN 3 9 9] 4] will equate to SM [9,3,4]. The sum of 9, 3 and 4 is 16, modulo 10 gives 6.

The next expression we need to calculate is [SM 6 2 6] and [SM 4 0 4]. The sum of 6, 2, and 6 is 14 and modulo 10 gives 4. The sum of 4, 0, and 4 is 8.
So, [MAX 4 [SM 6 2 6] [SM 4 0 4]] will equate to [MAX 4 4 8]. So, the maximum number is 8.

Then we have [MIN [SM [MAX 9 5 5] [MIN 3 9 9] 4] [MAX 4 [SM 6 2 6] [SM 4 0 4]] 6], which will give [MIN 6 8 6]. The minimum number is 6.

Next is [SM 8 2 9] which equals to 19, modulo 10 gives 9.

[MIN 2 7 5] is min(2, 7, 5) = 2,

So, the initial equation transforms to:
[MIN [MAX [MAX 0 6 9] [MAX 9 3 9] 5] 4 [SM 1 [SM 1 7 7] [SM 1 2 1]]]

Now, calculating the left MAX operations:
[MAX 0 6 9] is max(0, 6, 9) = 9,
[MAX 9 3 9] is max(9, 3, 9) = 9.

Thus, the equation becomes:
[MIN [MAX 9 9 5] 4 [SM 1 [SM 1 7 7] [SM 1 2 1]]]

Now, going inside the right SM operations:
[SM 1 7 7] is (1 + 7 + 7) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5,
[SM 1 2 1] is (1 + 2 + 1) mod 10 = 4 mod 10 = 4.

SM 0 8 7 = 5
SM 5 0 7 = 2
SM 8 4 9 = 1

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we would simplify the expressions within the smallest brackets i.e. operations with only three numbers. This results in:

[MIN 8 9 8]  = 8
[MIN 9 4 0] = 0
[MIN 3 6 1] = 1
[MAX 9 6 2] = 9
[MIN 5 9 5] = 5

[MAX 8 1 0]  = 8
[MAX 1 9 8]  = 9
[MIN 4 5 6]  = 4
[SM 6 3 7]   = 6

Substituting these values back in, the expression becomes:

After that, we simplify the SM expression, 

[SM 8 9 6] = 3 (since 8+9+6 = 23 and the sum modulo 10 is 3)

So the expression simplifies to:

[MAX 3 2 [MAX 4 9 6]]

Then, simplifying the MAX expression, we end up with: 

[MAX 4 9 6] = 9

So now, the entire expression turns to:

- [MAX 0 2 8] = 8
- [SM 3 1 8] = (3+1+8) % 10 = 12 % 10 = 2
- [SM 0 5 9] = (0+5+9) % 10 = 14 % 10 = 4
- [MIN 9 6 6] = 6
- [MIN 9 0 7] = 0
- [MIN 5 2 8] = 2
- [MAX 0 8 0] = 8
- [MIN 8 7 2] = 2

Then we replace these values and it becomes:

[MIN 6 [MAX 8 [MIN 8 5 2] [SM 6 4 1]] [SM 5 [MIN 0 2 2]]]

Further simplifying:

- [MIN 8 5 2] = 2
- [SM 6 4 1] = (6+4+1) % 10 = 11 % 10 = 1
- [MIN 0 2 2] = 0

Now it becomes:

[MIN 6 [MAX 8 2 1] [SM 5 0]]

Next:

- [MAX 8 2 1] = 8
- [SM 5 0] = (5+0) % 10 = 5

[MIN 6 8 5] = 5

Finally, computing the remaining operations:

- [MIN 7 9] = 7

Second, focus on the next set of operations inside the MIN operator. Let's start with SM 6 [MAX 9 2 1] [MAX 0 5 1].
Calculate MAX 9 2 1 which results in the maximum among these three values, which is 9.
Also, calculate MAX 0 5 1 which results in the maximum among these three, which is 5.
So, our updated operation becomes SM 6 9 5 = (6+9+5) modulo 10 = 20 modulo 10 = 0.

So, the fully evaluated inside operation of the first MIN operation is:
MIN [SM 5 2 8] 0 3 = MIN 5 0 3. The minimum value among these three numbers is 0.

Now, let's move on to the next part of the operation inside the second MIN operation and calculate:
SM [SM 9 3 5] [SM 0 5 9] 0 = SM 7 4 0 = (7+4+0) modulo 10 = 11 modulo 10 = 1.
Also, calculate the MIN operations: MIN [MIN 1 4 3] [MIN 9 2 3] 1 = MIN 1 2 1 = 1.

MIN 0 4 2, so the result is 0.

This gives us:

SM 8 0 
Using the sum modulo 10 operator, we get 8.

Next:

MIN [SM [MIN 0 6 2] 2 [MIN 2 6 6]] 8 [SM 9 [MAX 2 5 7] [SM 7 1 0]]
Here, SM [MIN 0 6 2] 2 [MIN 2 6 6] can be separated as: 
SM 0 2 2 = 4
Then, SM 9 [MAX 2 5 7] [SM 7 1 0] can also be separated as: 
SM 9 7 8 = 4

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve for the MAX and MIN functions.

The first MAX will give 8 because it is the maximum out of 1, 8 and 1. The second MAX will give 6 because it is the maximum out of 5, 1 and 6. The third MAX will give 6 because it is the maximum out of 6, 4 and 5. The first MIN will give 1 because it is the minimum out of 2, 1 and 5.

The fourth MAX, first SM, second SM, second MIN, third MIN, fourth MIN, fifth MIN are nested so we will calculate them after plugging in the values of the previously calculated functions.

Now the expression becomes:
[MIN [SM [SM 8 6 0] [MAX 6 1 3] 5] [MIN [SM [MIN 1 7 9] 0 [SM 3 5 0]] [MIN 1 [SM 4 1 0] 4] 6] 2].

We'll now solve for the nested MIN. It will yield 1 since it is the minimum out of 1, 7, 9, 0, 3 and 5.
Also, the nested SM will give 8 because it is the sum of 3, 5 and 0 modulo 10.

Substituting these, we get:
[MIN [SM [SM 8 6 0] [MAX 6 1 3] 5] [MIN [SM 1 0 8] [MIN 1 [SM 4 1 0] 4] 6] 2].

NEXT, solve for the nested SM. It will yield 9 since it is the sum of 4, 1, 0 modulo 10.
Also, solve for the nested MIN and MAX. The nested MIN will yield 1 since it is the minimum out of 1, 9 and 4. The nested MAX will give 6 since it is the maximum out of 6, 1 and 3.

Now we get:
[MIN [SM [SM 8 6 0] 6 5] [MIN [SM 1 0 8] 1 6] 2].

Simplify the nested SM. The first will yield 4 since it is the sum of 8, 6 and 0 modulo 10. The second will yield 9 since it is the sum of 1, 0 and 8 modulo 10.
[MIN [SM 4 6 5] [MIN 9 1 6] 2].

The first SM, and the second MIN are the final nested operations. Solving these next, the first SM gives 5 (4 + 6 + 5 modulo 10), and the second MIN gives 1 (the lowest of 9, 1, and 6). Giving us:
[MIN 5 1 2].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, resolve the innermost brackets:

[SM 9 9 4] becomes 2 (since 9+9+4=22 and 22 modulo 10 is 2),
[MAX 8 9 3] becomes 9 (since 9 is the biggest number),
[SM 8 1 9] becomes 8 (since 8+1+9=18 and 18 modulo 10 is 8),
[SM 6 1 5] becomes 2 (since 6+1+5=12 and 12 modulo 10 is 2),
[SM 6 9 7] becomes 2 (since 6+9+7=22 and 22 modulo 10 is 2).

Now, we have the slightly simpler expression:

[SM 3 1 4] becomes 8 (since 3+1+4=8),
[SM 2 [MAX 6 5 5] 5] becomes 6 (since 2+5+5=12 and 12 modulo 10 is 2),
[SM 2 4 2] becomes 8 (since 2+4+2=8).

So we have:
[MAX [MAX 5 [MAX 9 7 8] 6] 0 [SM [SM 8 1 8] 2 8]].

Continuing to solve:

[MAX 9 7 8] becomes 9 (since 9 is the biggest number),
[SM 8 1 8] becomes 7 (since 8+1+8=17 and 17 modulo 10 is 7).

So we have:

Solving next steps:

[MAX 5 9 6] becomes 9 (since 9 is the biggest number),
[SM 7 2 8] becomes 7 (since 7+2+8=17 and 17 modulo 10 is 7).

So we have:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can solve the inner-most brackets and operators. Here, we have:

1.  [MIN 0 6 5] = 0 (as 0 is the smallest integer among 0, 6, and 5)
2.  [SM 5 5 5] = (5 + 5 +5) % 10 = 5 (as the sum of 5, 5, and 5 is 15, and 15 modulo 10 is 5)
3.  [MAX 1 5 9] = 9 (as 9 is the largest integer among 1, 5, and 9)

7.  [SM 9 9 1] = (9 + 9 + 1) % 10 = 9 (as the sum of 9, 9, and 1 is 19, and 19 modulo 10 is 9)

Our updated expression looks like:
   [MAX 0 [SM [MAX 0 8 5] [MAX 9 7 9]] 1 [SM [MIN 1 5 7] 2 [MAX 5 9 6]]]

Secondly, we solve the next operators:

1.  [MAX 0 8 5] = 8 (as 8 is the largest integer among 0, 8, and 5)
2.  [MIN 1 5 7] = 1 (as 1 is the smallest integer among 1, 5, and 7)
3.  [MAX 5 9 6] = 9 (as 9 is the largest integer among 5, 9, and 6)

Our updated expression looks like:
   [MAX 0 [SM 8 [MAX 9 7 9]] 1 [SM 1 2 9]]

Thirdly, we solve the next operators:

1.  [SM 8 [MAX 9 7 9]] = (8 + 9) % 10 = 7 (as the sum of 8, and 9 is 17, and 17 modulo 10 is 7)
2.  [SM 1 2 9] = (1 + 2 + 9) % 10 = 2 (as the sum of 1, 2, and 9 is 12, and 12 modulo 10 is 2)

Our updated expression looks like:

[MAX 1 0 4] = max(1,0,4) = 4
[MIN 7 4 9] = min(7,4,9) = 4
[MAX 0 4 2] = max(0,4,2) = 4
[MAX 6 4 5] = max(6,4,5) = 6

Our equation will now look as follows:
[MAX 0 [MIN [MIN 3 6 3] [MIN 1 7 3] 4] [SM [SM 4 4 6] [MAX 4 6 2] 8]]

Secondly, calculate the values within the next set of brackets:
[MIN 3 6 3] = min(3,6,3) = 3
[MIN 1 7 3] = min(1,7,3) = 1
[SM 4 4 6] = (4+4+6) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4
