SM 1 3 9 = (13 MOD 10) = 3
SM 1 7 4 = (12 MOD 10) = 2
MAX 6 5 8 = 8
SM 8 6 7 = (21 MOD 10) = 1

The expression is then simplified to:

MAX [SM [MIN 1 9 1] [SM 0 0 0] 0] 5 [MAX 8 [MIN 3 2 4] [MIN 8 1 3]]

Next step:

MIN 1 9 1 = 1
SM 0 0 0 = 0
MIN 3 2 4 = 2
MIN 8 1 3 = 1

So, the expression becomes:

MAX [SM 1 0 0] 5 [MAX 8 2 1]

Further simplification:

SM 1 0 0 = 1
MAX 8 2 1 = 8

The expression is now:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve all of the innermost expressions:

- [SM 6 7 6] is equivalent to (6 + 7 + 6) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
- [SM 7 3 1] is equivalent to (7 + 3 + 1) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
- [SM 6 9 3] is equivalent to (6 + 9 + 3) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8
- [MAX 0 4 6] returns the largest number, which is 6
- [MAX 1 5 6] returns the largest number, which is 6
- [MAX 9 4 1] returns the largest number, which is 9
- [MAX 1 4 2] returns the largest number, which is 4
- [MAX 2 2 8] returns the largest number, which is 8

So we get:

[SM [MIN 9 2 1] 8 [MIN 8 6 6]] [MAX 4 [MIN 6 6 9] [SM 4 6 8]] 0.

Next, we can solve the MIN functions:

- [MIN 9 2 1] returns the smallest number, which is 1
- [MIN 8 6 6] returns the smallest number, which is 6
- [MIN 6 6 9] returns the smallest number, which is 6

So we get:

[SM 1 8 6] [MAX 4 6 [SM 4 6 8]] 0.

Next, we solve the remaining SM functions:

- [SM 1 8 6] is equivalent to (1 + 8 + 6) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5
- [SM 4 6 8] is equivalent to (4 + 6 + 8) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

So we get:

The MAX function returns the largest number, which is 8, so we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to identify the innermost brackets and solve them first, using the given operators. 

We start with performing the SM operation on 3,4,6. SM stands for sum modulo 10. So, we add up the numbers and then apply modulo 10 operation on the sum. 

SM 3 4 6 = (3 + 4 + 6) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3

Next, we find the minimum of 9 6 8 using MIN operator.

MIN 9 6 8 = 6

We similarly solve for MAX 6 3 0, MAX 6 6 3, SM 4 8 1, and MIN 7 7 6.

MAX 6 3 0 = 6
MAX 6 6 3 = 6
SM 4 8 1 = (4 + 8 + 1) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3
MIN 7 7 6 = 6

Applying the same method, next we process MIN 6 0 6, and MIN 7 4 [SM 2 4 4].

MIN 6 0 6 = 0
SM 2 4 4 = (2 + 4 + 4) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0
MIN 7 4 0 = 0

Substitute these values back to the equation, we now have:

MIN 7 [MIN 3 1 5] -> MIN 7 1 = 1

[MIN 3 1 5] -> 1

[MAX 7 3 5] -> 7

MIN [1 7] -> 1 

So MIN [MIN 7 [MIN 3 1 5] [MAX 7 3 5]] equals to 1.

[MIN 5 0 2] -> 0

[SM 2 6 3 -> (2+6+3) mod 10 = 1.

So [MAX [MIN 5 0 2] [SM 2 6 3] 5] equals to 5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we start from the inner operands, i.e., SM and MAX operations.

- SM [SM 2 7 4] = SM [3] = 3 (because 2+7+4 gives 13 and taking the modulo 10 gives 3)
- MAX [7 9 7] = 9

So, the first part of the equation turns into:

- MIN [MIN 5 [SM 3 0 9] [MAX 2 [MAX 7 0 3] [MAX 7 2 8]]]

Next, we do the MAX operations:

- MAX [7 0 3] = 7
- MAX [7 2 8] = 8

So, the first part of the equation becomes:

- MIN [MIN 5 [SM 3 0 9] [MAX 2 7 8]]

Continuing with the remaining SM operation:

- SM [3 0 9] = 2 (because 3 + 0 + 9 gives 12 and taking the modulo 10 gives 2)

And finally, the first part becomes:

- MIN [MIN 5 2 [MAX 2 7 8]]

Post this, we simplify the last MAX operation:

- MAX [2 7 8] = 8

So, the first part becomes:

- MIN [MIN 5 2 8]

Solve the final MIN operation and it becomes:

- MIN [2 8] = 2

Now, we need to go into the second half of the equation. Again, we start from the inner operands, i.e., the MIN operations:

- MIN [9 3 0] = 0
- MIN [4 7 5] = 4
- MAX [9 7 8] = 9
- MIN [9 5 8] = 5

So, the second half of equation becomes:

- MIN [SM [0] [4] 8] [6] [MIN 2 9 5]

Next, we do the SM operation:

- SM [0 4 8] = 2 (because 0 + 4 + 8 gives 12 and taking modulo 10 gives 2)

So, second part of the equation becomes:

- MIN [2] [6] [MIN 2 9 5]

Solve the remaining MIN operation and it becomes:

- MIN [2 6 2] = 2

- MIN [2 2]

[MAX 6 8 8] is 8,
[SM 1 9 9] is 9 (1+9+9=19, 19 % 10 = 9),

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, calculate the SM (sum modulo 10) operations:

SM 6 7 5 = (6 + 7 + 5) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8.

SM 0 6 3 = (0 + 6 + 3) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9.

SM 7 1 6 = (7 + 1 + 6) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4.

SM 6 6 7 = (6 + 6 + 7) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9.

SM 9 8 7 = (9 + 8 + 7) mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4.

Now the expression is:

Secondly, calculate the MIN and MAX operations:

MIN 3 8 = 3

MAX 7 6 4 = 7

MIN 6 9 9 = 6

MIN 4 9 2 = 2

Now the expression is:
[SM [MAX 3 7] [SM 6 9 1] 8] [MAX 9 [SM 4 9 2] [SM 2 8 4]] 8].

Continue calculating SM operations:

SM 6 9 1 = (6 + 9 + 1) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6.

SM 4 9 2 = (4 + 9 + 2) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5.

Substitute these into the original expression:
[SM [MIN [MAX 3 3 6] 0 [SM 9 3 4]] [MIN [SM [MAX 8 1 6] [MIN 6 1 2]] 5] 6].

Continue with the next layer calculations:

- [SM 8 1 6] = 5 (because 8+1+6=15, and 15 modulo 10 is 5)

Substitute these into the expression above:

[MAX 4 5 6] = 6
[MAX 7 1 4] = 7

The sum of 5,0,8 is 13, which mod 10 is 3
The sum of 9,5,1 is 15, which mod 10 is 5

2. MIN 1 9 9 = min(1, 9, 9) = 1
3. MIN 8 4 8 = min(8, 4, 8) = 4
4. MAX 1 5 0 = max(1, 5, 0) = 5
5. SM 3 1 0 = sum(3, 1, 0) % 10 = 4
6. SM 0 5 2 = sum(0, 5, 2) % 10 = 7
7. MIN 6 4 2 = min(6, 4, 2) = 2

Substituting these results back into the problem, we get:

MAX 3 [MIN 6 [MIN 9 6 1] [MAX 3 4 5]] [MIN [MAX [MAX 3 6 4] 4 8] 0 [SM 2 3 7]] 

Now, we can calculate the next level of expressions:

1. MIN 9 6 1 = min(9, 6, 1) = 1
2. MAX 3 4 5 = max(3, 4, 5) = 5
3. MAX 3 6 4 = max(3, 6, 4) = 6
4. SM 2 3 7 = sum(2, 3, 7) % 10 = 2

Substituting these results into the problem, we get:

Next: 

1. MIN 6 1 5 = min(6, 1, 5) = 1
2. MAX 6 4 8 = max(6, 4, 8) = 8

Substituting these in:

MAX 3 1 [MIN 8 0 2]

And finish up:

1. MIN 8 0 2 = min(8, 0, 2) = 0

Becomes

Let's first look at the first SM operation:

[SM 9 [SM 4 [SM [MAX 5 2 5] 3 [SM 8 8 2]] [MAX 5 [SM 7 7 7] [MIN 2 2 6]]]]

In this operation, inside the second ""SM"" operator first:

[SM [MAX 5 2 5] 3 [SM 8 8 2]]

Calculating the ""MAX"" operator, we get:

[SM 5 3 [SM 8 8 2]]

Calculating the ""SM"" operator, we get:

[SM 5 3 8] (as sum of 8, 8, and 2 is 18, and 18 modulo 10 is 8)

Continuing the calculation, we get:

[SM 5 3 8] -> [SM 8] (as sum of 5, 3, and 8 is 16, and 16 modulo 10 is 6)

So the first section gives us 6. Now let's calculate the next:

[MAX 5 [SM 7 7 7] [MIN 2 2 6]]

First, we need to calculate the operands:

[SM 7 7 7] -> [SM 1] (as sum of 7, 7, and 7 is 21, and 21 modulo 10 is 1)
[MIN 2 2 6] -> 2 (as the minimum of 2, 2, and 6 is 2)

Then the '[MAX 5 1 2]' operation gives 5 as the maximum value between 5, 1, and 2.

So the first big bracket gives us:

[SM 9 6 5], which results in [SM 0] as the sum of 9, 6, and 5 is 20, and 20 modulo 10 is 0.

Now let's calculate the second big bracket:

[SM [MIN 3 [MAX 2 7 8] [MIN 3 1 9]] [SM [MIN 3 9 3] 1 [SM 1 9 8]] 5]

Firstly, let's calculate [MIN 3 [MAX 2 7 8] [MIN 3 1 9]]. We have:

[MAX 2 7 8] -> 8 (as the maximum of 2, 7, and 8 is 8)
[MIN 3 1 9] -> 1 (as the minimum of 3, 1, and 9 is 1)
Then we have [MIN 3 8 1], which is 1.

Now for the second part, let's calculate [SM [MIN 3 9 3] 1 [SM 1 9 8]]. We have:

[MIN 3 9 3] -> 3 (as the minimum of 3, 9, and 3 is 3)
[SM 1 9 8] -> 8 (as the sum of 1, 9, and 8 is 18, and 18 modulo 10 is 8)
Then we have [SM 3 1 8], which is [SM 2] as sum of 3, 1, and 8 is 12, and 12 modulo 10 is 2.

So here we have [SM 1 2 5], which is [SM 8] as sum of 1, 2, and 5 is 8, and 8 modulo 10 is 8.

So for the whole operation:

[SM 0 8]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the innermost brackets: 

`[MAX 5 [MAX 7 1 2] [MAX 8 6 0]]` simplifies as follows:
- `[MAX 7 1 2]` becomes `7`, because 7 is the highest number.
- `[MAX 8 6 0]` becomes `8`, because 8 is the highest number.
So the expression becomes `[MAX 5 7 8]`, which simplifies to `8`.

`[MAX 2 [MAX 3 5 1] [MAX 7 9 5]]` simplifies as follows:
- `[MAX 3 5 1]` becomes `5`, because 5 is the highest number.
- `[MAX 7 9 5]` becomes `9`, because 9 is the highest number.
So the expression becomes `[MAX 2 5 9]`, which simplifies to `9`.

`[MAX [MAX 6 3 2] 4 [MIN 2 8 5]]` simplifies as follows:
- `[MAX 6 3 2]` becomes `6`, because 6 is the highest number.
- `[MIN 2 8 5]` becomes `2`, because 2 is the smallest number.
So the expression becomes `[MAX 6 4 2]`, which simplifies to `6`.

`[MAX [MIN 4 6 5] [MIN 1 4 3] 7]` simplifies as follows:
- `[MIN 4 6 5]` becomes `4`, because 4 is the smallest number.
- `[MIN 1 4 3]` becomes `1`, because 1 is the smallest number.
So the expression becomes `[MAX 4 1 7]`, which simplifies to `7`.

After that, let's substitute the inner max and min expressions to make the main expression look like this:
`[SM 0 [MIN 8 9 1] [MAX 6 7 0]]`

`[MIN 8 9 1]` simplifies to `1`, as 1 is the minimum number.
`[MAX 6 7 0]` simplifies to `7`, as 7 is the maximum number.

Now substitute these to get the main expression looking like this: 
`[SM 0 1 7]`

`[SM 0 1 7]` simplifies to `(0 + 1 + 7) mod 10`, as SM is sum modulo 10.
Finally, calculate the sum: `(0 + 1 + 7) mod 10` equals `8`. So the result of the expression is `8`.",8,8

MIN [7] 3 [MIN 8 0 0] gives 0 (MIN [8 0 0] return 0). 
MIN 3 1 6 gives 1.

- SM 9 5 0 = 14 mod 10 = 4
- MAX 7 7 8 = 8
- MAX 3 8 6 = 8

- SM 4 1 1 = 6
- MIN 6 5 4 = 4
- SM 1 5 0 = 6

Then, let's resolve the remaining MAX and MIN functions:

[MAX 6 3 6] = 6

[SM 7 1 9] = 7 (because (7+1+9) mod 10 = 7)

[MAX 3 2 3] = 3

[MIN 5 2 2] = 2

So, we have:

[MIN 3 [SM 6 [SM 7 1 9] 3] [MAX 9 3 2]]

Then, resolving the SM function we have:

[SM 6 7 3] = 6 (because (6+7+3) mod 10 = 6)

So, we obtain:

[MIN 3 6 [MAX 9 3 2]]

So the expression becomes:

Then simplify brackets again.
[SM 7 4 9] = (7+4+9) mod 10 = 0

- MIN returns the smallest of the numbers in a list.
- MAX returns the largest of the numbers in a list.
- SM takes the sum of the numbers in a list, but because it is ""sum modulo 10"", it will return just the last digit of the sum (If the sum exceeds 10, the last digit is returned).

- Replace the innermost values in the outer brackets:

- Continuing with the innermost functions:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, look for the innermost brackets. We start with the operations within square brackets:

1. [MAX 8 4 1] gives maximum of 8, 4, 1 which is 8.
2. [MAX 6 2 4] gives maximum of 6, 2, 4 which is 6.
3. [MAX 2 7 6] gives maximum of 2, 7, 6 which is 7.

So, we now have the expression with replaced values:

Go for the next round, again starting at the innermost brackets:

1. [SM 8 6 7] gives the sum of 8, 6, 7 modulo 10, which is (8 + 6 + 7) % 10 = 21 % 10 = 1.
2. [SM 3 7 2] gives the sum of 3, 7, 2 modulo 10, which is (3 + 7 + 2) % 10 = 12 % 10 = 2.
3. [SM 4 8 2] gives the sum of 4, 8, 2 modulo 10, which is (4 + 8 + 2) % 10 = 14 % 10 = 4.
4. [SM 0 6 0] gives the sum of 0, 6, 0 modulo 10, which is (0 + 6 + 0) % 10 = 6 % 10 = 6.
5. [MIN 0 3 3] gives minimum of 0, 3, 3 which is 0.
6. [MAX 9 9 7] gives maximum of 9, 9, 7 which is 9.

Replacing these gives:
[SM 3 [MAX 1 8 [MAX 7 4 2]]] [MIN 9 [MAX 6 4 6] [MIN 5 0 9]]].

Then in the next round of simplification:

1. [MAX 1 8 2] gives maximum of 1, 8, 2 which is 8.
2. [MAX 6 4 6] gives maximum of 6, 4, 6 which is 6.
3. [MIN 5 0 9] gives minimum of 5, 0, 9 which is 0.

So, we now have: [SM 3 8 2] [MIN 9 6 0].

1. [SM 3 8 2] gives the sum of 3, 8, 2 modulo 10, which is : (3 + 8 + 2) % 10 = 13 % 10 = 3.

[SM 6 9 5] = (6 + 9 + 5) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0

So, [SM 7 4 0] = (7 + 4 + 0) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1

And then, [MIN 1 2 1] = 1

1. Solving the first group:

- First, solve [MAX 3 3 3]. The maximum of 3, 3 and 3 is 3. Subsitituting this back into the expression, we get [MIN 2 [MAX 3 [MAX 1 2 3] 0] [MAX [MAX 1 6 5] 3 [SM 5 0 6]]].

- Then solve [MAX 1 2 3]. The maximum of 1, 2 and 3 is 3. Substituting this, we get [MIN 2 [MAX 3 3 0] [MAX [MAX 1 6 5] 3 [SM 5 0 6]]].

- Solve [MAX 3 3 0]. The maximum of 3, 3 and 0 is 3. Substituting, we get [MIN 2 3 [MAX [MAX 1 6 5] 3 [SM 5 0 6]]].

- Then solve [MIN 2 3]. The minimum of 2, 3 is 2. Substitute this, we get [MAX 2 [MAX [MAX 1 6 5] 3 [SM 5 0 6]]].

- Next, solve [MAX 1 6 5]. The maximum of 1, 6 and 5 is 6. Substituting, we get [MAX 2 [MAX 6 3 [SM 5 0 6]]].

- Solve [SM 5 0 6]. The sum of 5, 0 and 6 is 11. And modulo 10 of this sum is 1. Substituting, we get [MAX 2 [MAX 6 3 1]].

- Solve [MAX 6 3 1]. The maximum of 6, 3 and 1 is 6.
 
- Finally solve [MAX 2 6]. The maximum of 2 and 6 is 6.

- Then solve [MIN 7 9 0]. The minimum is 0. Subsituting this, we get [MIN 8 0] [SM [MIN 3 1 7] [MAX 4 5 9] 0] 1].

- Solve [MIN 8 0]. The minimum is 0. Subsitute this, we get [SM [MIN 3 1 7] [MAX 4 5 9] 0] 1].

- Next, solve [MIN 3 1 7]. The minimum is 1. Subsitute this into the expression, we get [SM 1 [MAX 4 5 9] 0] 1].

MIN 8 0 0 results in minimum value among 8, 0, 0 which is 0.

SM 2 4 2 yields (2+4+2) mod 10 = 8 mod 10 = 8

Substituting these results back into the equation, we now have:

MAX [MAX 5 9] [SM 2 6 5] 0 [SM 7 2 8]

Again, solve the innermost MAX and SM operations:

MAX 5 9 yields 9
SM 2 6 5 yields (2+6+5) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3
SM 7 2 8 yields (7+2+8) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7

Substituting these results back into the equation, we now have:

MAX 9 3 0 7

Finally, the MAX operator yields the highest number from the list, which is 9. So, the answer is 9.",9,9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we calculate the inner expressions:

- MIN 0 6 5 = 0
- SM 5 5 5 = 15, but as SM is modulo 10, we get 5
- MAX 1 5 9 = 9
- MAX 6 9 4 = 9
- SM 9 3 9 = 21, but modulo 10, we get 1
- MAX 2 7 0 = 7
- SM 9 6 0 = 15, but modulo 10, we get 5
- SM 9 9 1 = 19, but modulo 10, we get 9

Then we replace these values in the original expression:

MAX 0 [SM [MAX 0 8 5] [MAX 9 7 9] 1] [SM [MIN 1 5 7] 2 [MAX 5 9 6]]

Now we calculate next inner expressions:

- MAX 0 8 5 = 8, SM 8 5 = 13, modulo 10, we get 3
- MAX 9 7 9 = 9, SM 9 1 = 10, modulo 10, we get 0
- MIN 1 5 7 = 1, SM 1 2 = 3
- MAX 5 9 6 = 9

Replace the values:

MAX 0 [SM 3 0] [SM 3 9]

Then calculate SM operator:

- SM 3 0 = 3
- SM 3 9 = 12, modulo 10, we get 2

Replace again:

MAX 0 3 2

Finally, calculate the MAX, which gives us the final answer:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we solve the operations inside the brackets:

[SM 9 4 0] = (9 + 4 + 0) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3

[MAX 6 4 3] = max(6, 4, 3) = 6

[SM 3 4 4] =  (3 + 4 + 4) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1

[MAX 4 7 1] = max(4, 7, 1) = 7

[MAX 1 0 4] = max(1, 0, 4) = 4

[MIN 7 4 9] = min(7, 4, 9) = 4

[MAX 0 4 2] = max(0, 4, 2) = 4

[MAX 6 4 5] = max(6, 4, 5) = 6

Then, we substitute those results back into the original expression and continue to solve:

[MIN [MIN 3 6 3] [MIN 1 7 3] 4] 

[SM [SM 4 4 6] [MAX 4 6 2] 8]

Next, go deeper in the expressions:

[MIN 3 [MIN 1 3] 4]

[SM 4 [MAX 6 2] 8]

Calculate new brackets:

[MIN 3 1 4]

[SM 4 6 8]

And again solve operations in brackets:

1
[SM 4 6 8]

Finally result of future operations:

[SM 4 6 8] = (4 + 6 + 8) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we would solve for the SM operator since it only contains numbers. 

The following parts of the expression: [SM 6 9 4] [SM 1 0 8] [SM 4 8 3] [SM 2 0 3] [SM 4 9 2] can be simplified through taking the sum (modulo 10) of the numbers.

[SM 6 9 4] is (6 + 9 + 4) = 19. But we need to match only the single unit digit as the question demands, so it is 9.

[SM 1 0 8] is (1 + 0 + 8) = 9.

[SM 4 8 3] is (4 + 8 + 3) = 15. But we need to match only the single unit digit, so it is 5.

[SM 2 0 3] is (2 + 0 + 3) = 5.

[SM 4 9 2] is (4 + 9 + 2) = 15. But we need to match only the single unit digit, so it is 5.

After substituting these results, the expression becomes:

[MAX [MAX 3 [MIN 5 9 9] [MAX 5 [MAX 1 1 0] 4]] [MAX [MIN 1 [MIN 4 2 8] 5] 5 [MIN 4 5 [MAX 6 2 7]]] 0].

Now let's solve the MIN operator. [MIN 5 9 9] gives 5, [MIN 4 2 8] gives 2, and [MIN 4 5 [MAX 6 2 7]] gives 4 because the MAX operator inside the MIN is higher than 4, giving a value of 7.

After substituting these results, the expression becomes:

[MAX [MAX 3 5 [MAX 5 [MAX 1 1 0] 4]] [MAX 1 5 4] 0].

Finally, let's solve the MAX operator. [MAX 3 5] = 5, [MAX 5 [MAX 1 1 0] 4] = 5, [MAX 1 5 4] = 5, and [MAX 5 5] = 5.

So there's only one expression left: [MAX 5 5 0]. The result of this is 5.",5,5

[MIN [SM 9 0 0] 0] [MAX [SM 11 6] 1 7 6].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The result of MAX, MIN, and SM operations can range between 0 and 9. Therefore, we'll apply these operations step-by-step to simplify the initial expression.

First, starting from the inside out:

[SM 1 7 1] is (1 + 7 + 1) = 9 mod 10 = 9.
[MIN 2 0 6] is the minimum of 2, 0, and 6, which is 0.
[MIN 0 9 9] is the minimum of 0, 9, and 9, which is 0.
[SM 9 0 1] is (9 + 0 + 1) = 10 mod 10 = 0.
[MIN 3 3 3] is the minimum of 3, 3, and 3, which is 3.
[MIN 9 3] is the minimum of 9 and 3, which is 3.
[MAX 1 0 7] is the maximum of 1, 0, and 7, which is 7.
[MAX 5 9 9] is the maximum of 5, 9, and 9, which is 9.
[SM 7 9 3] is (7 + 9 + 3) = 19 mod 10 = 9.
[SM 7 8 3] is (7 + 8 + 3) = 18 mod 10 = 8.
[MAX 0 9 2] is the maximum of 0, 9, and 2, which is 9.
[SM 8 9] is (8 + 9) = 17 mod 10 = 7.
Then we simplify the expression as such:

[MAX 9 [MIN 3 6 0] 5 [MAX 9 8 7]] = 9. 

So, the whole expression gives 9.",9,9
