A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to evaluate the innermost brackets which involves SM and MIN operations. The SM operator computes the sum of the numbers and reduces them modulo 10. The MIN operator finds the smallest integer among the numbers.

[SM 4 0 3] => 4 + 0 + 3 = 7 (this is already below 10, so no modulo operation is needed)
[SM 4 8 1] => 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 (the modulo of 13 by 10 gives 3)
[MIN 3 3 4] => 3 (it's the smallest among the provided numbers)
[SM 4 9 8] => 4 + 9 + 8 = 21 (the modulo of 21 by 10 gives 1)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate any expressions between brackets:

MIN 6 [SM 0 2 2] means we have to calculate the minimum between the number 6 and the result of the sum of numbers 0, 2, and 2 modulo 10. As 0+2+2 = 4 (which is less than 6), our chosen value is 4.

Similarly, MIN 9 6 0 means we need to find the minimum of 9, 6, and 0, which is 0.

For MAX 0 3 0, we find the maximum of 0, 3, and 0, which is 3. 

For MAX 0 4 7, we find the maximum of 0, 4, and 7, which is 7. 

Now our expression reads as follows:

[MAX [4] [0]] [SM [3] 0 [7]] 5.

The operation SM [3] 0 [7] means that we sum the numbers 3, 0, and 7, and perform the operation modulo 10. 3+0+7=10. Taking the modulo by 10 gives us 0.

Now our expression reads as:

[MAX [4] [0]] [0] 5.

MAX [4] [0] means we take the maximum given these inputs, which is 4. 

Now our simplified expression is [4] [0] 5. 

The final operation is SM, the sum modulo 10 operation. Here, we sum 4, 0, and 5 getting 9, and taking modulo by 10 still leaves us with 9.

Next, we find the maximum of 2, 1, and 6 which is 6.

Then, apply the MIN operator to choose the smallest number among 4, 0, and 6. Thus, we get 0.

Similarly, we calculate MIN 9 9 6 and MIN 5 9 7. The smallest number in the first set is 6 and in the second set is 5.

Now, we find the maximum number among 6, 5, and 1 which gives us 6.

We also calculate SM 4 8 5, which equals (4+8+5) modulo 10 = 17%10 = 7, as the remainder of 17 divided by 10 is 7.

Then, let's figure out what SM 4 7 9 is: (4+7+9)%10 = 20%10 = 0.
We also need to calculate MAX 2 3 2. Maximum value among 2 3 and 2 is 3. So MAX 2 3 2 equals to 3.

So now we have [MIN 6 8] [MIN 0 7 3].
MIN 6 8 equals to 6, because 6 is the minimum between 6 and 8.
MIN 0 7 3 equals to 0, because out of 0, 7 and 3, 0 is the smallest.
