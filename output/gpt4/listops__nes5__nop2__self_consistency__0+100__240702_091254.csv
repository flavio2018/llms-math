Solve it yourself, do not suggest to use external tools.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, SM represents the sum of two numbers, modulo 10. This means that if the sum of the two numbers is greater than 10, we subtract 10 from the sum until we get a single digit number.

STEP 1: Do the deepest operations first:

- SM 8 6, which yields 14, but we subtract 10 because of the modulo 10, so we get 4.
- MAX 7 4 = 7
- MIN 1 7 = 1
- SM 3 5 = 8
- SM 3 2 = 5
- MIN 8 3 = 3
- MAX 0 8 = 8
- MIN 7 9 = 7
- MAX 2 1 = 2
- SM 4 1 = 5
- MIN 7 1 = 1
- MIN 1 2 = 1
- MIN 9 5 = 5
- MAX 0 5 = 5
- MAX 6 5 = 6 
- MIN 7 6 = 6

Now we substitute these values back into the expression:

[ MAX [ SM [ MIN [ MAX 4 7] [ SM 1 8]] [ SM [ SM 5 3] [ MAX 8 7]]] [ MIN [ MAX [ MIN 2 5] 1] [ MIN 5 6]]]

STEP 2: 

- MAX 4 7 = 7
- SM 1 8 = 9
- SM 5 3 = 8
- MAX 8 7 = 8
- MIN 2 5 = 2
- MIN 5 6 = 5 

Therefore, the expression becomes: 

[ MAX [ SM [ MIN 7 9] [ SM 8 8]] [MIN [ MAX 2 1] 5]

STEP 3: 

- MIN 7 9 = 7
- SM 8 8 = 16, but modulo 10 means we get 6
- MAX 2 1 = 2 

So, the expression simplifies to:

[ MAX [ SM 7 6] [MIN 2 5]]

STEP 4: 

- SM 7 6 = 13, but modulo 10 we get 3
- MIN 2 5 = 2 

So, our final expression is: 

[ MAX 3 2] 

So, the answer is MAX 3 2 = 3.",3,3

Solve it yourself, do not suggest to use external tools.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the inner-most expressions that are not dependent on any other operation in the main function.

[SM 2 4] = 2 + 4 mod 10 = 6
[SM 7 9] = 7 + 9 mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6
[SM 7 0] = 7 + 0 mod 10 = 7
[SM 6 5] = 6 + 5 mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
[SM 0 7] = 0 + 7 mod 10 = 7
[SM 9 4] = 9 + 4 mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3
[SM 9 3] = 9 + 3 mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2
[MIN 6 7] = minimum of 6, 7 = 6
[SM 5 6] = 5 + 6 mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
[SM 0 2] = 0 + 2 mod 10 = 2

Replace these calculations in the function.

Now: 
[MIN [MAX [MAX [MIN 6 [MAX 5 5]] [MAX 6 [MAX 9 6]]] [SM [MAX 7 [MIN 0 2]] [SM [MAX 1 7]]]] [MIN [SM [MIN 3 2] [MIN [MAX 2 5] [MIN 9 7]]] [MAX 6 1 [SM 2 [MAX 9 9]]]]]

Let's keep working on the inner-most expressions:

[MAX 5 5] = maximum of 5, 5 = 5
[MAX 9 6] = maximum of 9, 6 = 9
[MAX 1 7] = maximum of 1, 7 = 7
[MAX 2 5] = maximum of 2, 5 = 5
[MAX 9 9] = maximum of 9, 9 = 9

Replace these:

[MIN [MAX [MAX [MIN 6 5] [MAX 6 9]] [SM [MAX 7 0] [SM 7 7]]] [MIN [SM [MIN 3 2] [MIN 5 [MIN 9 7]]] [MAX 6 1 2]]]

Again, work on the innermost expressions:

[MIN 6 5] = minimum of 6, 5 = 5
[MAX 6 9] = maximum of 6, 9 = 9
[MAX 7 0] = maximum of 7, 0 = 7
[MIN 3 2] = minimum of 3, 2 = 2
[MIN 9 7] = minimum of 9, 7 = 7

Now:
[MIN [MAX [MAX 5 9] [SM 7 [SM 7 7]]] [MIN [SM 2 5 7] [MAX 6 1 2]]]

The last remaining SMs:

[SM 7 7] = 7 + 7 mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4
[SM 2 5 7] = 2 + 5 + 7 mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4

So we have:

[MIN [MAX [MAX 5 9] [SM 7 4]] [MIN 4 [MAX 6 1 2]]]

The last MIN, MAX and SM operations:

[MAX 5 9] = maximum of 5, 9 = 9
[SM 7 4] = sum of 7 + 4 mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
[MIN 4 [MAX 6 1 2]] = minimum of 4 and the maximum of 6, 1, 2 → minimum of 4 and 6 = 4

So the expression simplifies to:

[MIN [MAX 9 1] 4]

The last MAX operation:

[MAX 9 1] = maximum of 9, 1 = 9

And then, the final operation: 

[MIN 9 4] = minimum of 9, 4 = 4

So the expression equals 4.",4,7

Solve it yourself, do not suggest to use external tools.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we look inside the expression and solve the most-nested operations:

[SM 8 5] is 8 + 5 = 13, but this result is a double digit, so we apply modulo 10, which gives us 3.

[SM 7 9] is 7 + 9 = 16, but we apply modulo 10 on this also, so we get 6.

[SM 2 8] is 2 + 8 = 10, but we apply modulo 10 to get 0.

[SM 5 9] is 5+9=14, after modulo 10 operation, we get 4.

Next, we can replace these solved operations back:

[MIN [SM 8 5] [SM 7 9]] = [MIN 3 6], which is the minimum of 3 and 6, so it's 3.

[MAX [SM 2 8] [SM 5 9]] = [MAX 0 4], maximum of 0 and 4, so it's 4.

Then replace these into bigger expression:

[MIN 3 4] -> 3

Things are getting little bit simpler:

[SM [MIN 3 4] [MAX [MIN [SM 2 1] [MIN 7 8]] [SM [MAX 2 0] [SM 7 8]]]] [SM [MAX [MIN [MIN 7 9] [SM 6 5]] [SM [MIN 8 4] [SM 6 4]]] [MAX [MIN [SM 6 8] [SM 7 9]] [SM [SM 8 4] [MAX 2 8]]]]

Now we do similar steps for the next nested operations:

[SM 2 1] -> 2+1 = 3,
[MIN 7 8] -> 7,
[MIN 3 7] -> 3,

[SM 7 8] -> 7+8 = 15, then modulo 10 -> 5,
[MAX 2 0] -> 2,
[SM 2 5] -> 2+5 = 7.

Replace these back to previous expression,
we are left with:

[SM 3 [MAX 3 7]] [SM [MAX [MIN [MIN 7 9] [SM 6 5]] [SM [MIN 8 4] [SM 6 4]]] [MAX [MIN [SM 6 8] [SM 7 9]] [SM [SM 8 4] [MAX 2 8]]]]

Evaluate through the expression again:

[MAX 3 7] -> 7,
[SM 3 7] = 3 + 7 = 10, as it's double digit, we take modulo 10, which gives 0.

After replacing these back to previous expression,

we get:

[SM 0 [SM [MAX [MIN [MIN 7 9] [SM 6 5]] [SM [MIN 8 4] [SM 6 4]]] [MAX [MIN [SM 6 8] [SM 7 9]] [SM [SM 8 4] [MAX 2 8]]]]]

Next target is the second part of the above expression. Do same operations:

[MIN 7 9] -> 7,
[SM 6 5] -> 1,
[MIN 7 1] -> 1,
[MIN 8 4] -> 4,
[SM 6 4] -> 0,
[MIN 1 0] -> 0,

[SM 6 8] -> 4,
[SM 7 9] -> 6,
[MIN 4 6] -> 4,
[SM 8 4] -> 2,
[MAX 2 8] -> 8,
[SM 2 8] -> 0,
[MAX 4 0] -> 4.

After replacing these back in expression above, we get:

[SM 0 [SM [MAX 0 0] 4 ]]

Evaluate the remaining steps:

[MAX 0 0] -> 0,
[SM 0 4] -> 0+4 = 4.

Now final replacing back to expression gives us:

[SM 0 4] = 0+4 =4 (modulo 10 = 4)

Solve it yourself, do not suggest to use external tools.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we compute the operations inside the square brackets:

[MIN 5 3] = 3
[SM 9 3] = 2 (because 9 + 3 equals 12 then take 2 mod 10)
[SM 3 3] = 6
[MIN 3 9] = 3

[MIN 9 2] = 2
[SM 3 2] = 5 

[MIN 0 2] = 0
[MAX 9 9] = 9 

The next step involves computing the operations involving these new results:

[SM [MIN 5 3] [SM 9 3]] = [SM 3 2] = 5
[MAX [MIN 3 9] [SM 3 3]] = [MAX 3 6] = 6

[MIN [MIN 9 2] [SM 3 2]] = [MIN 2 5] = 2
[MAX [MIN 0 2] [MAX 9 9]] = [MAX 0 9] = 9 

Then, we proceed with the next level of operations: 

[MIN [SM 5 2] [MAX 6 3]] = [MIN 7 6] = 6
[MIN [MIN 2 5] [MAX 0 9]] = [MIN 2 9] = 2

On the other side of the expression:
[MIN 9 4] = 4
[MAX 8 7] = 8
[MAX 0 4] = 4
[MAX 7 2] = 7

[MIN 2 1] = 1
[MIN 9 9] = 9 

[SM 6 7] = 3 (because 6 + 7 equals 13 then take 3 mod 10)
[SM 1 1] = 2 

Then we do:

[MAX [MIN 9 4] [MAX 8 7]] = [MAX 4 8] = 8
[MIN [MAX 0 4] [MAX 7 2]] = [MIN 4 7] = 4

[MAX [MIN 2 1] [MIN 9 9]] = [MAX 1 9] = 9
[MAX [SM 6 7] [SM 1 1]] = [MAX 3 2] = 3

Proceed to the next level:

[SM [MAX 4 8] [MIN 4 7]] = [SM 8 4] = 2 (because 8 + 4 equals 12 then take 2 mod 10)

Solve it yourself, do not suggest to use external tools.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify each of the operators from inside the brackets to the outside.

Starting from the most inner operators:

[MIN [MAX 9 0]=[MIN 9] (as 9 is the maximum between 9 and 0)
[SM 6 4]=[SM 10] (as 6+4=10 but it's modulo 10 so it returns 0)
Thus, we have [MIN 9 0]=0 (as 0 is the minimum between 9 and 0)

Similarly:

[MIN 8 9]=[MIN 8] (as 8 is the minimum between 8 and 9)
[SM 8 2]=[SM 10] (as 8+2=10 but it's modulo 10 so it returns 0)
So we have [MIN 8 0]=0 (as 0 is the minimum between 8 and 0)

So far we have:

[MIN [SM 0 0]=[MIN 0] (as 0+0=0 modulo 10)

Let's keep going with the first argument in the initial expression until we simplified it. 

Next:

[MIN 7 3]=[MIN 3] (as 3 is the minimum between 7 and 3)
[SM 2 9]=[SM 1] (as 2+9=11 but it's modulo 10 so it returns 1)
So we have [SM 3 1]=[SM 4] (as 3+1=4 modulo 10)

And:

[MIN 8 6]=[MIN 6] (as 6 is the minimum between 8 and 6)
[MIN 7 1]=[MIN 1] (as 1 is the minimum between 7 and 1)
So we have [MIN 6 1]=1 (as 1 is the minimum between 6 and 1)

Therefore:

[SM [SM 4] [MIN 1]]= [SM 4 1]=[SM 5] (as 4+1=5 modulo 10)

So, the first argument within the major MIN operation is [MIN 0 5] which equals 0 (as 0 is the minimum between 0 and 5)

Let's simplify the second argument.

[MIN 7 0]=[MIN 0] (as 0 is the minimum between 7 and 0)
[SM 4 3]=[SM 7] (as 4+3=7)
So, [MAX 0 7]=7 (as 7 is the maximum between 0 and 7)

[SM 9 7]=[SM 6] (as 9+7=16 but it's modulo 10 so it returns 6)
[MAX 3 3]=[MAX 3] (as both are 3, the max is 3)
So, [MAX 6 3]=6 (as 6 is the maximum between 6 and 3)

Hence, [SM [MAX 7 6]=[SM 13]=[SM 3] (as 13 modulo 10 returns 3)

Next:

[MIN 3 9]=[MIN 3] (as 3 is the minimum between 3 and 9)
[MAX 8 1]=[MAX 8] (as 8 is the maximum between 8 and 1)
So, [SM 3 8]=[SM 11]=[SM 1] (as 11 modulo 10 returns 1)

Similarly,

[SM 2 2]=[SM 4] (as 2+2=4)
[MAX 7 7]=[MAX 7] (as both are 7, the max is 7)
So, [SM 4 7]=[SM 11]=[SM 1] (as 11 modulo 10 returns 1)

So, the second argument within the major MIN operation is [SM 1 1]=[SM 2] (as 1+1=2)

Finally, [MIN 0 2]=0 (as 0 is the minimum between 0 and 2)

So the result is 0.",0,1

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the innermost operations first:

[MIN 9 2] = 2,

[MIN 5 6] = 5.

Plugging these back into the equation, we get:

Solving further:

[SM 5 2] = 7,
[MIN 3 3] = 3,
[MAX 5 0] = 5,
[SM 6 6] = 2 (since 6 + 6 = 12 and 12 modulo 10 is 2),

[SM 3 5] = 8.

Then we have:

[SM [SM 5 7] [MAX 3 5]] [MAX [MIN 5 2] [MAX 8 8]].

Doing more operations, we get:

[SM 5 7] = 2 (since 5 + 7 = 12 and 12 modulo 10 is 2),
[MAX 3 5] = 5,
[MIN 5 2] = 2.

The result is:

- [SM 5 3] -> 8, [SM 4 3] -> 7 [SM 8 4] -> 2 mod 10 
- [MIN 9 7] = 7, [MIN 4 1] = 1, [MIN 7 9] = 7 so [MIN [MIN 9 7] [MIN 4 1]] = 1 and [MIN 1 2] = 1
- [MIN 0 9] = 0, [SM 3 8] = 1 mod 10, [MIN 7 9] = 7, [SM 2 9] = 1 mod 10 so [MIN [MIN 0 9] [SM 3 8]] = 0 and [MIN [MIN 7 9] [SM 2 9]] = 1
- [MAX 5 9] = 9, [MAX 2 7] = 7, [MAX 3 4] = 4, [SM 2 8] = 0 mod 10 so [MAX [MAX 5 9] [MAX 2 7]] = 9 and [MAX 4 0] = 4
So, the initial term becomes:
[MIN [MIN [MAX 4 [SM 2 2]] [MIN 1 1]] [SM [SM 0 1] [MAX 9 4]]]

Now, performing the operations:
- [MAX 4 [SM 2 2]] -> [MAX 4 4] = 4
- [MIN 1 1] = 1, so [MIN 4 1] = 1
- [SM 0 1] -> 1, so [SM 1 4] = 5 mod 10

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first step is to simplify the innermost brackets:

[SM 1 1]  = 2 (Because the sum of 1+1=2)
[SM 7 9] = 6 (Because the sum of 7+9=16, and 16 modulo 10 = 6)
[MIN 7 7] = 7 (Since minimum between 7 and 7 is 7)
[MIN 0 0] = 0 (Since minimum between 0 and 0 is 0)
[MAX 4 6] = 6 (Maximum of 4 and 6 is 6)
[SM 7 1] = 8 (Sum of 7 and 1 is 8)
[MAX 9 5] = 9 (Maximum of 9 and 5 is 9)

[SM 4 5] = 9 (Sum of 4 and 5 is 9)
[MIN 1 5] = 1 (Minimum of 1 and 5 is 1)

[SM 8 1] = 9 (Sum of 8 and 1 is 9)
[SM 3 1] = 4 (Sum of 3 and 1 is 4)

Now, substituting these values back into the expression, we get:

[MAX 7 0] = 7 (Maximum of 7 and 0 is 7)
[MAX 6 8] = 8 (Maximum of 6 and 8 is 8)

Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:

MAX [MIN 4 2] [MAX 0 3] = MAX 2 3 = 3

So, the first main expression becomes: MAX [MIN 4 3] = 3

Next, for the second inner expressions:

MAX [MAX 4 0] [MAX 3 7] = MAX 4 7 = 7
SM 5 4 = 9 MOD 10 = 9

So, the second group becomes: SM [MAX [MAX 4 0] [MAX 3 7]] [MIN [SM 5 4] [SM 3 9]] = SM 7 2 = 9

Now, for the third part:

SM [MIN 9 6] [SM 9 5] = SM 6 4 = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First simplifying from inside means starting from the deepest and innermost operators:

[MIN 0 2] stands for 0, [MIN 8 5] ends up as 5, [MAX 5 3] is 5, and [SM 5 0] is 5.

Then simplifying replacing the previous operations we have: 
[MAX [MIN [MIN 0 5] [SM 5 5]] [MIN [MAX [SM 9 1] [MIN 0 2]] [MIN [MIN 9 1] [MAX 1 4]]]] [MAX [MIN [MAX [MIN 5 9] [MAX 5 2]] [MIN [MIN 1 8] [SM 4 1]]] [MIN [MAX [MAX 8 3] [MIN 2 3]] [SM [SM 7 4] [SM 8 1]]]]

Continue from inside expressions: 
Calculating [SM 9 1] results in 0 (because 9+1=10 and SM implies Sum modulo 10 so the remainder when 10 is divided by 10 is 0), [MIN 0 2] is 0, [MIN 9 1] is 1, [MAX 1 4] is 4, [MIN 5 9] is 5, [MAX 5 2] is 5, [MIN 1 8] is 1, [SM 4 1] is 5, [MAX 8 3] is 8, [MIN 2 3] is 2, [SM 7 4] is 1 (because 7+4=11 and SM implies Sum modulo 10 so the remainder when 11 is divided by 10 is 1), [SM 8 1] is 9.

Rewriting the expression now is: [MAX [MIN [MIN 0 5] 0] [MIN [MAX 0 0] [MIN 1 4]]] [MAX [MIN [MAX 5 5] [MIN 1 5]] [MIN 8 [SM 1 9]]]

Continue simplifying: 
[MIN 0 5] is 0, [MIN 0 0] is 0, [MIN 1 4] is 1, [MAX 5 5] is 5, [MIN 1 5] is 1, [SM 1 9] is 0. 

Continue with the new simplified expression: 
[MAX [MIN 0 0] [MIN 0 1]] [MAX [MIN 5 1] [MIN 8 0]]

Finally these simplifications result as: [MIN 0 0] is 0, [MIN 0 1] is 0, [MIN 5 1] is 1, [MIN 8 0] is 0. So plugging these into the equation gives us:

[MAX 0 0] [MAX 1 0]

- SM 7 8 gives 15, but because it's sum modulo 10, we only consider the remainder when divided by 10, so it gives 5
- MIN 9 3 gives 3
- MIN 4 3 gives 3
- MAX 5 3 gives 5
- MIN 7 9 gives 7
- MIN 3 2 gives 2
- SM 2 2 gives 4
- MIN 3 8 gives 3
- MAX 2 4 gives 4
- SM 5 6 gives 11, but it's sum modulo 10, so we get 1
- MIN 8 3 gives 3
- MAX 7 0 gives 7
- MAX 8 8 gives 8
- MIN 2 8 gives 2
- SM 7 6 gives 13, but it's a sum modulo, so we get 3

Substitute these values back to the original expression:

- MIN 3 3 gives 3
- MIN 5 7 gives 5
- MAX 2 4 gives 4
- SM 3 4 gives 7, but because of the modulus 10 operation, the result is still 7
- MIN 1 3 gives 1
- MIN 7 8 gives 7
- MIN 2 3 gives 2

Substitute these values back to the expression:

In the updated expression, compute the inward results again:

- MAX 5 3 gives 5
- MAX 5 4 gives 5
- SM 7 1 gives 8
- SM 7 2 gives 9, but because of the modulus 10 operation, the result is still 9

Substitute these values back to the expression:

In the updated expression, compute the results:

- MIN 5 5 gives 5
- SM 8 9 gives 17, but because of the modulus 10 operation, the result is 7

Substitute these values back to the expression:

In the second step we will calculate the SMs:

Next, we input these values into the first SM function:

[SM 4 5] = 9

Next, we'll solve next inner functions:
[MAX 9 1] = 9
[MIN 7 5] = 5
[MIN 9 5] = 5

[MIN 1 8] = 1
[SM 3 4] = 7
[MAX 1 7] = 7

[MIN 5 7] = 5

Given these values, we input them into the first MIN function:

[MIN 9 5] = 5

Next, we'll solve the inner functions of the MAX part:
[MAX 2 1] = 2
[MIN 5 0] = 0
[MAX 2 0] = 2

[MAX 2 2] = 2
[MIN 2 2] = 2

[MAX 2 2] = 2

Pointing out that 
[MIN [MAX 2 0] [MIN 2 2]] = [MIN 2 2] = 2
and
[MIN [MAX 2 2] [MAX 2 2]] = [MIN 2 2] = 2
we can simplify
[MAX [MIN [MAX 2 0] [MIN 2 2]] [MIN [MAX 2 2] [MAX 2 2]]]
into
[MAX 2 2] = 2

The right part of the MAX function:
[MAX 9 3] = 9
[MIN 9 3] = 3
[MAX 9 3] = 9

[MIN 9 6] = 6
[MIN 8 2] = 2
[SM 6 2] = 8

[MAX 9 8] = 9

Given these two values, we input them into the MAX function:

[MAX 2 9] = 9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the expressions inside the innermost brackets:

- [MIN 8 6] = 6
- [MIN 7 2] = 2
- [SM 7 3] = 0 (because 7 + 3 = 10, and 10 modulo 10 is 0)
- [MIN 2 9] = 2
- [SM 9 8] = 7 (because 9 + 8 = 17, and 17 modulo 10 is 7)
- [MIN 7 6] = 6
- [MAX 7 3] = 7
- [MIN [MAX 2 2] [MAX 4 6]] = [MIN 2 6] = 2
- [MIN 5 3] = 3
- [SM 2 6] = 8 
- [SM [MIN 8 0] [MAX 1 5]] = [SM 0 5] = 5
- [SM 7 9] = 6 (because 7 + 9 = 16, and 16 modulo 10 is 6)
- [SM 9 9] = 8 (because 9 + 9 = 18, and 18 modulo 10 is 8)

Substituting these expressions into the original, we get:
[MIN [MIN [MAX 6 [SM 0 2]] [MIN [SM 0 0] [MAX 6 7]]] [SM [SM 2 [MAX 3 8]] [MIN 5 [MAX 6 8]]]]

Now we calculate the new innermost expressions:

- [SM 0 2] = 2
- [MAX 6 [SM 0 2]] = [MAX 6 2] = 6
- [SM 0 0] = 0
- [MAX 6 7] = 7
- [SM 2 [MAX 3 8]] = [SM 2 8] = 0 (because 2 + 8 = 10, and 10 modulo 10 is 0)
- [MIN 5 [MAX 6 8]] = [MIN 5 8] = 5

Inserting these values into the expression, we have:
[MIN [MIN 6 [MIN 0 7]] [SM 0 5]]

Calculating the inner expression:

- [MIN 0 7] = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve all the MIN, MAX and SM operations that don't involve other operations:

SM 0 5 = 5 
MAX 7 9 = 9
MIN 9 8 = 8
MAX 5 7 = 7
MAX 4 7 = 7
SM 8 2 = 0, because the result 10 is taken modulo 10 
MIN 8 7 = 7

Next steps:

MAX 2 5 = 5
MIN 7 0 = 0

SM [MIN 5 8] = SM [5] = 5

MIN [MAX 3 0] [SM 0 4]

MIN [3] [4] = 3

SM [5] [3] = 8

For the second set, we have:

MAX [SM 8 1] [MIN 6 8] 

MAX [9] [6] = 9

MIN [9] [MIN [SM 1 6] [SM 2 7]]

MIN [9] [7] = 7

So the entire left side reduces to

For the right side:

SM [MIN [MIN 3 8] [MAX 3 5]]

SM [3] [5] = 8

SM [SM 6 4] [MIN 5 8]

SM [0] [5] = 5

To continue:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's break down the expression:

MAX [SM [MAX [SM [MAX 2 0] [SM 5 0]] [SM [MIN 5 5] [SM 0 4]]] [SM [SM [MAX 7 2] [MAX 5 2]] [MAX [MAX 8 2] [MAX 7 9]]]] [SM [SM [MAX [MIN 1 4] [MIN 0 7]] [MIN [MIN 1 4] [MAX 7 8]]] [MAX [SM [MAX 4 0] [MIN 9 5]] [SM [MIN 0 1] [MIN 9 9]]]].

We start from the most inner operation:

MAX 2 0 = 2
SM 5 0 = 5
SM 2 5 = 7
MIN 5 5 = 5
SM 0 4 = 4
SM 5 4 = 9
MAX 7 9 = 9

So the first part becomes SM 9 9.

Then we continue with the second part:

MAX 7 2 = 7
MAX 5 2 = 5
SM 7 5 = 2 (because it's sum modulo 10, so 7+5=12, take the last digit which is 2.)
MAX 8 2 = 8
MAX 7 9 = 9
MAX 8 9 = 9
SM 2 9 = 1 (2+9=11, take the last digit which is 1.)

So the whole first part becomes MAX [SM 9 9] 1, which simplifies to MAX 18 1 = 18.

We continue with the third part:

MAX [MIN 1 4] [MIN 0 7] = MAX 1 0 = 1
MIN [MIN 1 4] [MAX 7 8] = MIN 1 8 = 1
SM 1 1 = 2
MAX 4 0 = 4
MIN 9 5 = 5
SM 4 5 = 9
MIN 0 1 = 0
MIN 9 9 = 9

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[SM [SM [MIN [MAX [MAX 2 5] [SM 4 1]] [MAX [MIN 4 8] [MAX 9 1]]] [MIN [SM [SM 9 6] [MIN 3 2]] [MAX [MAX 0 3] [SM 9 6]]]] [MAX [MIN [MAX [MIN 9 2] [SM 7 5]] [MAX [MIN 8 1] [MIN 2 2]]] [MIN [MAX [MAX 5 7] [MIN 0 7]] [SM [SM 7 3] [MIN 5 2]]]]].
Solve it yourself, do not suggest to use external tools.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's resolve all the MIN, MAX, and SM operations within the square brackets that have integers directly stated within them.

- [MAX 2 5] = 5
- [SM 4 1] = 5 (since 4+1=5)
- [MIN 4 8] = 4
- [MAX 9 1] = 9
- [SM 9 6] = 5 (since 9+6=15 and 15 modulo 10 is 5)
- [MIN 3 2] = 2
- [MAX 0 3] = 3
- [SM 9 6] = 5
- [MIN 9 2] = 2
- [SM 7 5] = 2 (since 7+5=12 and 12 modulo 10 is 2)
- [MIN 8 1] = 1
- [MIN 2 2] = 2
- [MAX 5 7] = 7
- [MIN 0 7] = 0
- [SM 7 3] = 0 (since 7+3=10 and 10 modulo 10 is 0)
- [MIN 5 2] = 2

Substitute the computed values back into the square brackets.

    [SM [SM [MIN [MAX 5 5] [MAX 4 9]] [MIN [SM [SM 5 2] [MAX 3 5]] [MAX [MAX 5 7] [MIN 0 2]]]] [MAX [MIN [MAX 2 2] [MAX 1 2]] [MIN [MAX 7 0] [SM 0 2]]]]

Computing the remaining MAX and MIN values:

- [MAX 5 5] = 5
- [MAX 4 9] = 9
- [MIN 5 2] = 2
- [MAX 3 5] = 5
- [MAX 5 7] = 7
- [MIN 0 2] = 0
- [MIN 2 2] = 2
- [MAX 1 2] = 2
- [MAX 7 0] = 7
- [MIN 2 0] = 0 (since 0 is less than 2)

Substitute the computed values back into the square brackets.

    [SM [SM [MIN 5 9] [MIN [SM 2 5] 7]] [MAX [MIN 2 2] 0]]

Extract the remaining MIN, SM, and MAX values:

- [MIN 5 9] = 5
- [SM 2 5] = 7 (since 2+5=7 and 7 modulo 10 is 7)
- [MIN 2 2] = 2

Substitute these back into the expression:

    [SM [SM 5 [MIN 7 7]] [MAX 2 0]]

Resolve the last MIN and MAX:

- [MIN 7 7] = 7
- [MAX 2 0] = 2

Substitute back into the expression:

    [SM [SM 5 7] 2]

Calculate the two remaining SM operations:

- [SM 5 7] = 2 (since 5+7=12 and 12 modulo 10 is 2)
- [SM 2 2] = 4 (since 2+2=4 and 4 modulo 10 is 4)

The computed result of the entire operation is 4.",4,2
