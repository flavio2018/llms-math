And for multiplication part: 
(-114) * 87 = -9924. Modulo -100 is again -24.

You then need to combine these last resulting values:

For the multiplication 38*-8, the result is -304, we take modulo -100 because the result is negative, this gives us -4.

For the subtraction -4-46, the result is -50, we take modulo -100 because the result is negative, this gives us -50.
So, -4-46=-50.

Now, let's substitute the results back into the original expression. The expression now looks like:

The next step is to perform the multiplication and subtraction:

For the multiplication 34*-4, the result is -136, we take modulo -100 because the result is negative, this gives us -36. 
So, 34*-4=-36.

For the subtraction -68-(-50), the result past this step is -18, we take modulo -100 because the result is negative, this gives us -18.
