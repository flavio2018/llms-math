The expression n OR F turns into just n, since anything OR False is the original term.

   iii. Continuing with the same simplification, we have (((F&F)|T)|T) = T and (F&T) = F.

((((n|F)|n)&(T&(((T|T)&(j|T))&(!F))))&(!F)).

Using the logical identities, T|T is T, i.e. True OR True is True. So we can simplify the expression to:

((((n|F)|n)&(T&((T&(j|T))&(!F))))&(!F)).

Now, check for n|F. n OR False will always be n. Also, n OR n will always be n, so the expression now can be further simplified to:

((n&(T&((T&(j|T))&(!F))))&(!F)).

Now, check for T&(j|T), j OR True will always be True. So, T & (j | T) will be T, which simplifies the expression to:

((n&(T&((T&T)&(!F))))&(!F)).

True AND True is True and T & (!F) is also True because NOT False is True:

((n&T)&(!F)).

Similarly, ((n & T) & (!F)) simplifies to (n & T) as logical NOT False is True:

(n & T).

In logical AND when True is AND with any Boolean, the result is the Boolean itself, in this case n. Hence, the final simplified expression is:
