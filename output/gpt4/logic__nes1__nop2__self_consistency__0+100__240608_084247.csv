0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","'h' can have a value of either True or False.

If 'h' is True, then the whole expression (h|T) becomes (True|True), which is True.
If 'h' is False, then the whole expression (h|T) becomes (False|True), which is True.

So in all cases, the whole expression (h|T) simplifies to True regardless of the value of 'h'. Thus, the simplified form of the logic formula is T.",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula (F|T) translates to (False OR True). This is a basic logical operation and the result of ""False OR True"" is always True. So, the simplified form of the given logic formula is True or in symbols, T.",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical formula is simply v&T
This means v AND T

Since anything ""AND True"" results in the original value, the simplified formula is simply v.",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Regardless of the value of ""o"", if we are considering a logical ""or"" operation with False, the result would be equivalent to the value of ""o"" itself. 

So, the simplified form of the given logic formula (o|F) would be ""o"".",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The output of logical ""or"" operation is False only when both operands are False. Here one operand is already False (F). So the only determining value is the other operand which is q. So

q|F = q.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression ""(f&F)"" is a logical ""and"" expression. According to the law of logical ""and"", if any one of the operands is false, the whole expression evaluates to false. As ""F"" represents False, irrespective of what ""f"" represents, the expression will always compute to False. Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is ""F"".",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","""w&w"" means that ""w"" and ""w"" have to be both true for the whole expression to be true, but as both terms are the same, the simplified form will be just ""w"".",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The ""or"" operator (|) gives True if at least one of the operands is True. However, in this case, the second operand is False (F). Therefore, the result of ""b or False"" will always be the value of b, regardless of whether b is True or False. Hence, the simplified form of the formula is just:
b.",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In a logical or operation, if any of the operands is True, the result is True. Since ""o"" can only be True or False and we are doing a logical or operation of ""o"" with ""o"" itself, the result can be only ""o"" itself, whatever it's value is. So the simplified version of ""(o|o)"" is just ""o"".",o,o
