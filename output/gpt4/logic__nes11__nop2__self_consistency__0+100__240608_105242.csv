3. Also, with De Morgan's laws, ((i|F)&F) is equivalent to F.

- Also, something and False will always return False (m & F = F), like something or True will always return True (m | T = T).

- In the case where there is both and and or, like A & B | A, this simplifies to A as this expression is saying A and B or A without B, effectively covering for A regardless of B.

- In the case of !F or !T, it simplifies to T or F respectively as negation flips the logical value.

1. (F | (!F)) simplifies to T.

2. !T simplifies to F.

3. (j | F) simplifies to j.

4. (j & T) simplifies to j.

5. (F | (T & T)) simplifies to T.

6. (((F & T) | (T | T)) & F) simplifies to F.

7. (T & (w | T)) simplifies to T.

8. ((j & T) & j) simplifies to j.

9. (j | F) simplifies to j.

It now looks like this:

(j | j) | j

The expression has been simplified to just j as the logic says j must be true. Any ""or"" operations amongst the same literals can be simplified to just the literal as obviously, if j were true, it wouldn't matter if there were further j's.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the expressions involving T and F.

1. We know that (T|F), (F|T), and (T|any_expression) always result in T. So, we can replace all these occurrences by T.

2. (F&(any_expression)) always returns F. 

3. As for (any_expression&F), it also returns F. But, we don't have this in our expression. 

4. Finally, (any_expression|F) will always return the same expression.

After applying these simplifications, our expression becomes:

!(k|((k&(k))&((t&t)&T))|T)) which simplifies further to:

!(k|(k&T)|T) since k&k gives k and t&t gives t (Idempotent laws).

This simplifies further to:

!(k|T) since k&T results to k as we know that (any_expression&T) = any_expression.

As mentioned earlier, (any_expression|T) always return T. Therefore the whole expression simplifies to:

!T

As 'not True' is False, the final simplified logic formula is:

T&anything = anything;
T|(anything) = T;
!F = T;
(anything)|F = (anything);
F&anything = F;
(anything)&T = anything;

Step 1: Starting with '((T|(!F))&((w&F)&T))', applying the above rules we simplify (!F) to T and (w&F) to F, then it becomes '((T|T)&F)' which simplifies to F.

Step 2: So, the original expression changes to '(((y|F)&((y&(T&F))|y)&(y|(g&s&F)&y))|(F|T))'.

Step 3: ((T&F)) becomes F and 'g&s&F' becomes F so, the expression becomes '(((y|F)&((y&F)|y)&(y|F&y))|(F|T))'.

Step 4: Using the rules '(y|F)' becomes y and '(F|T)' becomes T, then the expression transforms into '((y&y&y)|T)', 'y&y&y' simplifies as y and therefore the transformed expression is '(y|T)'.

Step 5: Since y can either be True or False the expression '(y|T)' simplifies to T. As y|T is equal to T, even if y is F because F|T = T and if y is T then, T|T also equals T.

∴ The simplification of the given complex formula is T (True).",T,T

1. (z&F) is always False because anything AND-ed with False results in False. 
2. ((i&i)&i) is equivalent to i (i itself). 
3. i OR False OR i is equivalent to i (i OR False), because any value OR-ed with False yields that original value. 

Applying these findings, our formula can now be simplified to:

(i|(i&i)&T)|(T|(F&F))

Again:

1. (F&F) is just False. 
2. i AND with i yields just i itself. 
3. Something AND-ed with True yields the original value, i in this case. 
4. Anything OR-ed with True is also always True. 

Now, the formula simplifies to:

```
((F&(!(F|(((((s&(!(F&F)))|F)&T)|F)|T))))|(!(((w|(((w|(((w&w)|w)|w))&w)|F))|T)&T))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, we know that T and F in logic represent True and False respectively. (T|!T) is a tautology, i.e., it always evaluates to True regardless of the values of other variables. Similarly, (F|F) always evaluates to False. 

Also, !T always evaluates to False, and T evaluates to True. On the other hand, !(d&F) simplifies to (!d|!F), which is equal to (!d|T), and therefore to True, because or operation with a tautology always results in true.

Here are the things that should simplify automatically:
1. F&T = F, because we know the 'and' operator ('&') is only true if both operands are true. So anything with F '&'(and) something is always F.
2. T|anything = T, because we know the 'or' operator ('|') is true if either or both of the operands are true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We can simplify (((F&(F|T))&T)|T) to T.
Reasoning: In the expression ((F&(F|T)), even if (F|T) is True, 'F&True' leads to False. Therefore, (((False) & T) | T) turns into False or True, which is True.

2. We can simplify the nested negations (!(!(F|(T|T)))) to False.
Reasoning: (F|(T|T)) becomes True. Then, !True becomes False, and once again negating gives us False.

3. We can simplify (T|(!((T&T)|F))))) to True. 
Reasoning: (T&T) is T. Then T|F is T. And negation !T is F. At last T|F is T or True.

4. Overall, the first part of the expression, a&(T&(((F&(F|T))&T)|T)), simplifies to a&T or a if a is True, False otherwise.

5. Substituting a&(((!(!(F|(T|T))))&(T|(!((T&T)|F))))|T)) as 'a', we get a&F which is always False.

6. As a result, (!(((a&(((!(!(F|(T|T))))&(T|(!((T&T)|F))))|T))&a)&F))) simplifies to True since the negation of False is True.

7. Finally, simplifying the entire expression ((a&(T&(((F&(F|T))&T)|T)))|(!(((a&(((!(!(F|(T|T))))&(T|(!((T&T)|F))))|T))&a)&F))) gives us an output of a|True, which will permanently be True.",True,T

2) Therefore, (c|(!T)) simplifies to (c|F) which is just 'c'.
3) (T&Anything) is simply 'Anything' because Anything AND True retains the value of Anything. Thus, T&(((y&y)&y)|(y|((c&(c&(c&T)))|((T|(((w&F)&F)|(T&((d&d)|(!F)))))&T)))) simplifies to (((y&y)&y)|(y|((c&(c&(c&T)))|((T|(((w&F)&F)|(T&((d&d)|(!F)))))&T)))) which can be simplified further.
4) (y & y) simplifies to y. Hence, ((y&y)&y) simplifies to (y&y) which is again 'y'.
5) (False & Anything) simplifies to False. Hence, (w&F) simplifies to F and therefore, ((w&F)&F) simplifies to F as well.
6) (!F) stands for NOT False, which is True.
7) (d&d) simplifies to 'd', so (T&((d&d)|(!F))) simplifies to (T&(d|True)), which further simplifies to 'T', because (Anything | True) is True.
8) Therefore, (T|((w&F)&F)|(T&((d&d)|(!F)))) simplifies to (T|F|T) which further simplifies to T, because (F | Anything) retains the value of Anything.
9) (c&T) becomes 'c' and so (c&(c&(c&T))) simplifies to (c&c&c) which is 'c'.
10) So (y|((c&(c&(c&T)))|((T|((w&F)&F)|(T&((d&d)|(!F)))))) simplifies to y|c|T which is 'T'.

So let's start with simplifying the nested brackets in your logic formula:

1. !(T|(!(!(!(F|(!F)))))) is simplified to F, because double negation of any value is equal to the value itself and ""!F"" equals to ""T"". Hence, ""(F|(!F))"" equals to ""T"". Then since (!T) equals to F, therefore the whole expression ""(T|(!(!(!(F|(!F)))))"" is equivalent to ""T"". Hence, ""!(T)"" will be ""F"".

2. (!(T&F)) simplifies to T, because ""T&F"" is ""F"" and hence ""!(F)"" equals to T.

3. (!((o|(!(T&F)))|F)) is simplified to F, because ""(o|(!(T&F)))"" = ""(o|T)"" equals to T. And then ""(T|F)"" is ""T"", so ""!T"" is ""F"".

4. ((b|(((!((o|(!(T&F)))|F))|F)&F)) is simplified to F, because ""(!((o|(!(T&F)))|F))"" = ""F"". Then ""F|F"" is ""F"" and hence  ""(b | F) & F"" = ""b & F"" equals to F.

Applying these results to the original formula gives us:

(((z|(z|F))|F)|(((b|F)|T)&F)).

Again applying the simplification rules:

1. (z|F) simplifies to z, and
2. ((b|F)|T)&F simplifies to F.

So, your formula is now simplified to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, remember that T (True) and F (False) are the ultimate values and constants here, so regardless of what operation you apply, they will always stay their stated values. Hence, T&F or F&T will always be False (F), and F|T or T|F is always True (T), regardless of their order in the operation.

Secondly, remember the negation rule: !F is T, and !T is F. So, whenever you encounter ! before F or T, just directly replace these by their negations.

Using these rules and simplifying given logic formula step by step.

Step 1: 

Since we have two large components separated by '|', we can start by simplifying them separately. Let's start with the left part first:

(F & (!(F|(!((T & (T|(!((F|F) & (T|F)))))) & T))).

In the inner most of the brackets, (F|F) simplifies to F. Since F &(T|F) simplifies to F, the inner part becomes (!F), which further simplifies to T. This makes the second component (T & (T|T)) & T. Since anything OR'd with itself will remain the same, this reduces to (T&T) & T, which simplifies back to T&T, which further simplifies to T.

So the left component simplifies to (F & (!F)), which is equivalent to F. 

Let's now simplify the second, right part:

((T & (T&(((F|((F&(F|T))|F))|F) &T))) & F).

Since any value AND'd with False (F) becomes F, the whole formula directly simplifies to F.

So the formula simplifies to: F or F. The OR logic implies that if any (or both) of the terms are True, the resultant would be True. However, since both the terms are False, the simplified answer becomes False => F. 

So, the simplified form of the given logic formula is F.",F,F

5. u|F or u OR False gives us u, according to OR rules.
6. T|T, or True OR True, will give us True.

Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:

(i&(i|(i&(i&i))))&((((((i&(i|(i&i)))&((a|a)&a)|T))|F)|i)

Notice that anything OR that same thing (i|i or a|a) simplifies to that thing (i or a). Therefore, the expression becomes:

2. !T = F, !F = T.
3. Double negation !(!P) = P.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, recall that:
- anything AND with False (F) is always False
- anything OR with True (T) is always True
- NOT False is True
- NOT True is False

So the original formula can be simplified as follows:

1. ((F&(u&((o&o)&F)))|(!(!((((o|(o&o))|F)&((o&(((o|(F&F))&(o|(o|o)))&(o|F)))&o))&F)))

   Here the ((o&o)&F) and ((o&(((o|(F&F))&(o|(o|o)))&(o|F)))&o) both become F because whatever inside the bracket AND with F becomes F. 

   So, it simplifies to:

    ((F&u&F)|(!(!((o|o|F)&F))).

2. We know (o|o|F) simplifies to (o|F) and anything OR with F leads to itself. So, it becomes:

   ((F&u&F)|(!(!(o&F)))

3. (o&F) is F and (F&u&F) is also F so we have:

   (F|(!(!F)))

4. NOT True is False so it simplifies to:

   (F|(!T))

5. NOT False is True so the final simplified logic formula is:

2. Anything or itself would give that same value, for example (m | m) is just m. So the following replaces are made,  

    m|(m|(m|m)) -> m
    m|(m|((m|m)&T)) -> m
    m|(m|(m)&T) -> m

4. However, anything ""ORed"" with True is True. So ""(((T&F)&F)&!(T|T|F))"" simplifies towards ""T"". And ""l|F|T"" simplifies to ""T"".

3. The bitwise AND operation with False will always yield False. So, (p|F)&F = F&F = F

4. If we have bitwise OR(|) operation with True and any value, the result will always be True. Thus, F|T = T, (F&T)&T = F

5. The whole result of the large parenthesis starting from (t&((p|F)&F)...can be simplified to t&T = t.

F&(!F) simplifies to F
d|(!F) simplifies to d|T, which is T.

3. F|T simplifies to T. Consequently, the formula becomes (T&(l|((s&T)|(T|((!F)|((!(F|(T|F)))|((z&F)|F)))))).

4. As any value AND True is that same value, s&T simplifies to s. Therefore, (T&(l|(s|(T|((!F)|((!(F|T))|((z&F)|F))))))) is the simplified version of the formula.

5. !F simplifies to T. Hence, the formula simplifies as follows (T&(l|(s|(T|(T|((!(F|T))|((z&F)|F))))))).

6. !(F|T) simplifies to F. So, the formula simplifies further to (T&(l|(s|(T|(T|(F|((z&F)|F))))))).

7. (z&F) simplifies to F. Thus, the formula becomes (T&(l|(s|(T|(T|(F|F)))))).

3. Similar expression can be simplified as:
   - (z|(z|z)) simplifies to z as Logical OR of z with z gives z.
   - ((z&z)|F) simplifies to z as Logical AND of z with z gives z. Logical OR of z with False gives z.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","For the simplification we will break down the given expression using laws of logic.

1. First of all, (!T) is always False, and (T&F) is also always False. Therefore, (!(T|(!(T&F)))) simplifies to (!(T|F)) which is always False.

2. (T|F) is always True. However, since it is Negated, (!(T|F)) becomes False.

3. Since (f|False) is equal to f, the expression can be simplified to (f|f).

4. Secondly, let's deal with (f&(f|(!T))). (!T) is always False, so (f|(!T)) is equal to f.

5. Thus, (f&(f|(!T))) simplifies to (f&f), which is simply f.

6. Moreover, ((f&f)&T)&f simplifies to f since (X&Y)&Z = X&(Y&Z) also X&True=X and X&X=X. 

7. Lastly, we have to simplify (((f|f)&T)|F)|f. Since f|f = f, and f&T is equal to f (since X&True=X), the expression simplifies to (f|F)|f.

- Null law: p & F = F and p | T = T
- Idempotent law: p & p = p and p | p = p
- Negation law: p & !p = F and p | !p = T

Let's simplify:

(!(T&F))&(!T&F))

We have one more part:

(n|((n&n)|n))&n)|T

(n|n)&n|T

Next, F | T = T (False or True = True). So, every time when F or T is operated with any boolean value, the result equals that value. For example, T | X = X and F | X = X.

Also, F & T = F (False and True = False). Every time when F or T is operated with any other boolean value, the result will not change this value. For example, T & X = X and F & X = F.

Considering these rules, let's simplify the expression. We'll go from inside to outside:

(((!(F|(!F)))&F)&(((x&((!T)&(T&F)))|F)|T)) = ((!(F | T)) & F) & ((x & (F & F)) | F) | T) = (F & F) & (x|F)|T = F | T = T.

- (((z|F)&T)|T)): As any value OR-ed with False (F) equals the value itself (z|F equals z), and any value AND-ed with True (T) equals the value itself (z&T equals z), this simplifies to (z|T). Again, any value OR-ed with True (T) equals True, this simplifies eventually to T.

- ((T|((j|T)|(F|T)))): This simplifies to T, because anything OR-ed with True equals True. 

- ((F|(F|T))|T)): This simplifies to T as well.

- (((!(T|((j|T)|(F|T))))|((F|(F|T))|T))|F): We've found the values of both sides of OR to be T (from the steps mentioned above). So, it translates to (T|T), which simplifies to T.

- ((T&T)&T)): As anything AND-ed with True equals the value itself T, this simplifies to T.

- (!((((!(T|((j|T)|(F|T))))|((F|(F|T))|T))|F)|((T&T)&T))): We've found the values of NOT, OR and AND operations to be T. As anything AND-ed with False (F) equals False itself, this simplifies finally to !T.

Taking all these simplified terms and substituting them in the original formula, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value and False (F) is always False. Therefore, ((F&(T&(T&T)))&F) simplifies to F. So, the expression becomes ((((w|(F|F))|(w|(u&(u&(F&F)))))|T)&(F|(T&F))).
2. Any value or False is always that value. Therefore, (F|F)would simplify to F and (F&F) would simplify also to F. Thus, the formula now becomes: ((((w|F)|(w|(u&u&F)))|T)&(F|(T&F))).
3. Now we can simplify (((w|F)|(w|(u&u&F)))|T) because (w|F) will always be True (if w is True) or False (if w is False), and the same stands for (u&u&F), which will always be False. Thus, the formula simplifies to (((w|w)|T)&(F|(T&F))).
4. Any value or itself is always that value. Therefore, the formula then becomes ((w|T)&(F|(T&F))).
5. Anything OR True is always True: (T & (F|(T&F))).
6. And again, anything OR False is always that value. So, the expression (F|(T&F)) is either T (if T is True) or F (if T is False), but since T is True, it simplifies to T.

For example, 

(a&F) -> F
(!(!(state))) -> state
(w|F) -> w
(w|T) -> T 
(F&(a&F)) -> F

Solving these within the expression, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's break down the inside part of the expression that contains only literal values:

1. (!F) equals to T (because the negation of False is True)
2. T&(T&T) equals to T&T (because True and True is True), next T&T equals to T (because True and True is True)
3. (!(!(!T))) equals to F (because the negation three times of True is False)
4. Then, T|F equals to T (because True or False is True)
5. (!T) equals to F (because the negation of True is False)

So, we simplify the formula by injecting these values:

((T|(F|((F|((T&T)&T))|F)))|(!(!(j&(a&F)))))

Next, here are a few more simplifications we can make:

6. (F|F) equals to F (because False or False is False)
7. (T&T) equals to T (because True and True is True)
8. (!F) equals to T (because the negation of False is True)

Inject these values:

(T|((T&T)|T))|(!(!j))

More simplifications we can make:
9. (T|T) equals to T (because True or True is True)

Inject the result again:

(T|T)|(!(!j))

Last simplification to do:

10. !(!j) equals to j (because double negation keeps the initial value)

The final expression is:

Since expression (!T) is equal to F, and anything AND-ed with a false value is also false, the last part of the expression simplifies to ((F & T & F), or simply, F.

Then we have: 
((T | !(F & T)) & (T & !((d | (b & b | F & F)) | F | T))).

Then (F & T) is simplified to F, and (b & b | F & F) simplified to b | F. 

So it becomes: 
((T | !F) & (T & !(d | b | F | T))).

Using the logical law that anything OR-ed with a False is itself, b | F becomes b. Also anything OR-ed with a True is True, so the entire right hand expression T & !(d | b | F | T) becomes T & !T, which is F.

((j&((F&((!(!T))&T))|T))&((T&(!(i|(!T))))|T))

Step 2: Continue simplifying.
After applying Double Negation, we get:

((j&((F&((T)&T))|T))&((T&(!(i|T)))|T))

Step 3: Continue simplifying.
Apply Law of Identity and Law of Nullity on remaining parts,

((j&(F|T))&(T|T))

Step 4: Continue simplifying.
We use law of Nullity and Dominance:

(j&T&T)

Step 5: Continue simplifying.
We apply Law of Idempotence:

(j&T)

So ((j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T))&(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T)) simplifies to (j&T).",j&T,j

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, recall that anything OR-ed (|) with True (T) will result in True, anything AND-ed (&) with False (F) will result in False and the negation of True (!T) is False (F).

So:

1. T | T = T; 
2. !T = F; 
3. !(!T) = !!F = T; 
4. T | F = T; 
5. F | T = T; 
6. F & T = F; 
7. F & F = F.

Let's replace these values in the formula:

(((s&(T|F))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&T)&((h|T)|T))&F)&T))))

Further simplification:

((s & T) & s) | (s | (s & (((o & T) & T) & F)))

And even further simplification:

(s & s) | (s | (s & (o & F)))

As o & F will be F, the formula reduces to:

(s & s) | (s | (s & F))

And as s & F will be F, the formula reduces to:

(s & s) | (s | F)

In Boolean algebra, anything OR-ed with False stays the same so:

s | F = s  

the formula then becomes:

(s & s) | s

Since s AND-ed with itself will always yield itself, the final simplified form is

s | s 

And this is equivalent to s. Thus, the simplified form of the given formula is simply s.",s,s
