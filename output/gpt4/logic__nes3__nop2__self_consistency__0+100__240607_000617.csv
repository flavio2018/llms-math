A: Let's think step-by-step.","According to the laws of Boolean algebra, anything OR-ed with True yields True because at least one condition is True. Anything OR-ed with False yields the original value because the False condition contributes nothing.

(((s&s)|s)&(s&(T|T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, remember that ""T | T"" will always equal True (T) and ""s & s"" will always equal ""s"".  

So first simplification:   
((s | s) & s) & (s & T) is simplified to  
(s & s) & T. 

You can further simplify it because ""s & T"" equals ""s"" just like ""s & s"" equals ""s"". 

So final simplification:

(((n&n)&n)|((s&s)&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, n & n & n simplifies to n, because a value logically AND-ed with itself remains that value.

Likewise, s & s simplifies to s.

Next, anything logically AND-ed with False is always False, so (s & F) simplifies to F.

Thus, the whole expression simplifies to (n | F), which simplifies further to just n, because anything logically OR-ed with False is that value itself.

So, the simplified logic formula is n.",n,n

(((!F)|(F|T))&(T&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","(!F) returns True, because it is the negation of False.

(F|T) returns True, because True or anything is always True.

So, ((!F)|(F|T)) simplifies to (True|True), which is True.

However, (T&F) is False, because True and False is always False.

So, the whole expression (((!F)|(F|T))&(T&F)) simplifies to (True&False), which is False.",False,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, !T is equal to F.
T&T equals T.
T&F equals F
The expression can be then rewritten like:

((c|F)|((c|F)&(T&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, you can simplify (T&T) as this is simply T (True).

2. Then, (c|F) remains as is, resulting in c or False (c|F) since any literal or False is just the literal itself.

3. Therefore, ((c|F)&T) is simply (c|F) because any literal and True is simply the literal itself.

4. The final expression becomes (c|F)|((c|F)&T) simplifies to (c|F)|(c|F) which is equivalent to c|F.

((y|(y|y))&(y|(y&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify expression (y|y). According to the rules of boolean algebra, ORing a variable with itself always gives the original variable. Therefore, (y|y) simplifies to y.

Second, we consider the expression (y|y), where y can be either True or False. As above, ORing a variable with itself always gives the original variable. Therefore, (y|y) simplifies to y as well.

((i&(T&T))&((i&T)&i)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Since the semantics are logical and, logical or and logical not, according to their function:

""T&T"" will return True.

Substitute this into the expression: (i&True)&((i&T)&i)

The [element & True] Truth table will yield the value of the element. Hence, (i&True) simplifies to i.

So, we get: i & ((i&T)&i)

Similarly, the ""(i&T)"" will simplify to i, since the value of T in ""i&T"" always yields the value of ""i"".

So, we get: i & (i&i)

""(i&i)"" always yields the value i. 

So, our final simplified expression is: i & i, which simplifies to i.",i,i

(((c&c)|T)&(l&(T&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, T&F is False because both inputs need to be True for logical ""and"" operation output to be True. 
So, (((C&C)|T)&(L&(T&F))) becomes (((C&C)|T)&(L&F)).

L&F is False because both inputs need to be true for logical ""and"" operation output to be True.
So, (((C&C)|T)&(L&F)) becomes (((C&C)|T)&F).

""C&C"" will always be just ""C"". So, the expression becomes (C|T)&F.

""C|T"" is always True because ""or"" operation only requires one input to be True. So, the expression becomes T&F.

Finally, ""T&F"" is False because logical ""and"" operation requires both inputs to be True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Logical operations are simplified as follows

1. (q & q) simplifies to just q, since a value logically ""anded"" with itself just returns the value itself.
2. (q | q) also simplifies to just q, since a value logically ""or-ed"" with itself just returns the value itself.
3. (q | F) simplifies to q, since a value ""or-ed"" with False also just returns the value.

2. Thus, ((!F)&T) will be the same as (T&T) which is True.
3. (T&T) simplifies to T.
4. Leaving with us (T&(o|T)).
