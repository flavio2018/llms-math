0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Any value or statement combined with ""True"" using logical OR will always be True. This is because for an OR operation, if any one of the inputs is True, the result is True. Hence, the simplified form of (h|T) is T (True).",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical operator | means ""or"". So the expression F|T can be read as ""False or True"". Since we only need one of the values to be True in an ""or"" operation, the whole expression simplifies to True, denoted by T.",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The ""and"" operator (&) requires both its operands to be true in order for the whole expression to be true. So when 'T' is 'and' with any other variable, the result is simply the value of that other variable. 

Therefore, (v&T) simplifies to just 'v'.",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula is (o|F). Here, | represents logical OR. So, if any one of the values is true, the result is true.

Firstly, ""F"" represents False. And anything OR False is just itself.

So, (o|F) simplifies to just ""o"".",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","A logical OR operation between any variable and False will always be equivalent to the variable itself. That is, (q|F) is equivalent to q. This is because if q is True, the OR operation is True (as True OR False is True). If q is False, the OR operation is also False (as False OR False is False), effectively making (q|F) always equivalent to q.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In logic, if an AND operation (denoted by &) has one of its operands as False (F), the result is always False, regardless of the other operand. So, (f&F) simplifies to F (False).",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","We have ""w & w"". This means ""w 'and' w"". 
As in the logic of 'and'(&), it gives True if all the statements are true. In this case, either 'w' is True or False. 
When w is True, 'w' and 'w' all become True, so the result is True. 
When w is False, 'w' and 'w' all become False, so the result is False.
So, we can simply say the simplified logic formula is 'w'.",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The operation (b|F) means the logical OR of b and false. According to the truth table of the logical OR operation, the result is false only when both operands are false. But here, one operand is already false (F). So the result of the operation will actually depend just on the value of b. Hence, (b|F) simplifies to just b.",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","""o|o"" means ""o OR o"". In logical operations, if either of the inputs is true then the OR operation gives a true result. 

Since both inputs here are the same (both are ""o""), the result is simply ""o"" because if ""o"" is true, ""o|o"" is true; and if ""o"" is false, ""o|o"" is also false. 

So, the simplified formula is ""o"".",o,o
