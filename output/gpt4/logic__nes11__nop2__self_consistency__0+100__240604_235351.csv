A: Let's think step-by-step.","First consider the innermost operations. Here they are: `(T&T)|T`, `T&F`, and `(i|F)&F`.

- `(T&T)|T` is `True or True`, which simplifies to `T`.
- `T&F` is `True and False` which simplifies to `F`.
- `(i|F)&F` is `(i or False) and False`, which simplifies to `False`.

Substitute the simpler formulations back into the original formula:

`((m|((m&T)|((((m&((T)&(!(F))))&T)&((m|(F))&T))|(m|m))))|m)&(m|F)`.

Next consider simpler operations. We have: `(T)&(!(F)`, `m|(F)`, and `(m|F)`.

- `(T)&(!(F))` is `True and not False`, which simplifies to `T`.
- `m|(F)` is `m or False`, which simplifies to `m`.
- `(m|F)` is `m or False`, which simplifies to `m`.

Substitute the simpler formulations back into the original formula:

`((m|((m&T)|((((m&(T)&T)&m)|T)|(m|m))))|m)&m`.

Further consideration of simpler operations yields: `m&(T)&T`, and `m|m`.

- `m&(T)&T` is `m and True and True`, which simplifies to `m`.
- `m|m` is `m or m` which simplifies to `m`.

Substitute the simpler formulations back into the original formula:

`((m|((m&T)|(m|T)|m)|m)&m`.

At this point, similar operations are repeated, and it should be clear that:

`m|((m&T)|(m|T)|m)|m` always simplifies to `m`.

Hence, the simplified formula is `m&m` which is `m`.",m,m

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) First, we will start with simplifying each bracket from the inside out. We start with the internalmost brackets.

    (F|(!F)) - This is always True because either F is True, or F is not True, there's no other possibility. Hence, we replace (F|(!F)) with T.
    
    (T&T) - This is always True if T is True. Hence, we replace it with T.
    
    ((F&T)|(T|T)) - This is always True because either True or anything is always True. Hence, we replace ((F&T)|(T|T)) with T.
    
2) After the first simplification, the formula becomes:

    (((j|(!(T&T)))&j)|(((((j&((F|(T))&(w|T)))&j)|j)|F)|j))
    
3) We will simplify more as:
    
    ((F|T)&(w|T)) - This is always True because anything OR True is True. Hence, we replace (F|T)&(w|T) with T.
    
4) After this simplification, the formula becomes: 

    (((j|(!T))&j)|(((((j&T)&j)|j)|F)|j))
    
5) We further simplify to:

    (!T) - This is always False, because T is True. Hence, we replace (!T) with F.
    
6) After this simplification, the formula becomes:

    (((j|F)&j)|(((((j&T)&j)|j)|F)|j))
    
7) We simplify further, keeping in mind that j or F is equivalent to j:

    (((j&j)|(((((j&T)&j)|j)|F)|j))
    
8) And j and j is just the same as j hence,

    ((j|((((j&T)&j)|j)|F)|j))
    
9) And again simplifying (j&T)&j and (j|j) to j we get

    ((j|j|F|j))

For any literal v,

    - v & T = v  
    - v | F = v  
    - v & F = F  

Using this, we can simplify the given logic formula to: 
!((k|((k&k))|T)).

Notice that k & k is simply k, so we can further simplify it to:

!(k|k|T).

Simplifications with OR operation gives:

!(T). 

Finally, 'NOT True' is False. So, the simplified logic formula simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The clauses (T&((s|((T|(!F))&((w&F)&T)))|T)) can be simplified to T|T -> T, because or operator with any clause and True results in True.
2.  (a|T)) can also be simplified to T, because or operation with any clause and True results in True.
3. Therefore, the clause ((F&(a|T))) becomes (F&T) and can be simplified to F, because and operation with False gives False
3. (T&((s|((T|(!F))&((w&F)&T))))) can be simplified to just T because negate False (!F) will give True and or operation with True gives True.
4. ((y|(g&(s&F)&y))) now becomes (y|F)&y which simplifies to F&y and finally F, because and operator with any clause and False results in False.
5. So far, the expression looks like this: (((y|F)&((y&T)&y))|(F|T))
6. The clauses (F|T) gives True because or operation with any clause and True results in True.
7. (y|F) -> y because or operation with any clause and False results in that clause.

2. Any value OR with False will yield the value itself. So, (i|F) will be i. Similarly, (i|(i&F)) will be i.
3. Any value AND with True will yield the value itself. So, ((i|i)&T) will be (i|i), which is i.
4. Any value AND with itself will be the value itself. So, (i&i) will be i. 
5. Any value OR with True will be True regardless the value. So, (T|(any value)) will be T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. `(T&F)` is always `F` since `False AND anything` is `False`. Same rule applies to `(o&F)` => `F`.

2. `NOT F` is `T`, since `Not False` is `True`. Therefore `!(o&F)` becomes `!F` which is `T`. 

3. `Anything OR F` is `anything`, so `(e OR F)` becomes `e`. Same rule applies to `((e OR e) OR F)` => `e OR F` => `e`.

4. `Anything AND T` is `anything`, so `((((e AND T) AND e) OR e) AND T)` simplifies to `e AND e AND e` which is just `e` as `e AND e` is `e`. 

5. `T OR anything` is always `T`. So, `(T OR (g & F))` simplifies to `T` and `(T OR T)` to `T`.

6. `F AND Anything` is always `F` so `((T & T) AND F)` becomes `F`.

7. `Anything OR F` simplifies to `anything`. So, `(k | F)` becomes just `k`.

8. `(g & e) OR k` becomes `(k OR g) AND e` due to distributive law of logic operations equivalent to `(k OR (g AND e))`.

9. `( l AND (l AND (g AND e)))` simplifies to `(l AND g AND e)` because `A AND A` yields `A`.

10. `(l AND (k OR g) AND e)` is equivalent to ` ( l AND (k OR (g AND e)))`.

11. `Anything OR T` simplifies to `T`, so `(l OR T)` becomes `T`.

Since and operation with False gives False, and False or T gives T (because OR operation with True always results in True), we get,

(y & (True | not (T)))

Since not T is False, we get,

(y & (True | False))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Here are the steps to simplify the logic formula:

1. Remove the redundant terms (like (T|F)) to simplify the formula:

    First, simplify (T|F), where T is True and F is False. So, T|F is True (since T or F is True), it will be like this:
    (((!(!(o|True)))|F)| (q|((T&(z|(True|True)))|T))).

    Then, simplify the term ((F|T)|T), where F is False, T is True. So, (F|T) and (T|T) is True, it will be like this:
    (((!(!(o|True)))|F)|(q|((T&(z|True))|T))).

    And, simplify the term `(r|T)`, which will be True because of the `or`. Hence `(u|(r|T))` will be `(u|True)`. So, it will be like this:
    (((!(!(o|True)))|F)|(q|(T|(z|True)|T))).

    Then, we also have `(F&F)` which will be False. So the term `((F&F)&F)` will become `False & F` that modular be False. So, it will be like this:
    (((!(!(o|True)))|F)|(q|(T&(z|True)|T))).

2. Use the fact that ""A or True"" is equivalent to ""True"" and ""A and True"" is equivalent to ""A"". The simplification becomes:

    Simplify `(o|True)` to `True`, and `True` with the ""not"" operator (`!True`) becomes `False`. The `False` with another ""not"" operator (`!!False`) becomes `False` again. The term `|False` will not change the boolean outcome. So, the term `(!(!(o|True)))|F)` will become `False`. And `False or A`, the answer will be `A`.
    So, the term `False|(q|(T&(z|True))|T)` will be simplified to `(q|(T&(z|True))|T)`.

    In `(q|(T&(z|True))|T)`, `(z|True)` will be `True` and `T&(True)` will be `T` and the term `T or anything` is equal to `True`. So, the term `(q|(T&(z|True)|T)` will become `True`.

3. So the overall simplification will be `True`.",True,F

2. For any literal a, a & F = F. So, (((y | !F) & F) & T) = (y & F) & T = F & T = F. Thus, we have ((o & o) | (((k | F) | (m & !(!((r | T) & T))))) & F) | F = ((o & o) & F) | F = F | F = F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Here are the simplification steps:

1. F&T is always False, because 'and' operator results true if and only if both operands are true. 
   Therefore, we substitute 'F&T' with 'F' in the expression:

   ((z&((T&F)|T))|F)|((z&(!((((!F)|((z|T)|((T|F)&F)|(!(T|F)))))&F))|F))

   becomes

   ((z&((T&F)|T))|F)|((z&(!((((!F)|((z|T)|((T|F)&F)|(!(T|F)))))&F)))&T)

2. We know that in 'or' operation, the result is true if any one operand is true. T|F is always True, simplifying the expression:

   ((z&((T&F)|T))|F)|((z&(!((((!F)|((z|T)|((T|F)&F)|(!(T|F)))))&F)))&T)

   becomes

   ((z&((T&F)|T))|F)|((z&(!(((F|(z|T))|(!(T|F)))&F)))&T)

3. We can simplify the expression 'T&F' to 'F':

   ((z&((T&F)|T))|F)|((z&(!((((!F)|((z|T)|((T|F)&F)|(!(T|F)))))&F)))&T)

   becomes

   ((z&((F)|T))|F)|((z&(!((((!F)|((z|T)|((F)|(!(T|F)))))&F)))&T)

4. F and T with 'or' operation will result in True, because 'or' gives true if any one operand is true. Now we have:

   ((z&(T))|F)|((z&(!((((!F)|((z|T)|((F)|(!(T|F)))))&F)))&T)

5. Simplify the expression '!F' since 'not' of False is True, the expression becomes:

   ((z&(T))|F)|((z&(!((((T)|((z|T)|((F)|(!(T|F)))))&F)))&T)

6. Now, 'T' & 'F' can be simplified to 'F', which leaves us with:

   ((z&(T))|F)|((z&(!((((T)|((z|T)|(!T)))&F)))&T)

7. '!T', i.e., 'not True' simplifies to 'F', which leaves us with:

   ((z&(T))|F)|((z&(!((((T)|((z|T)|F))&F)))&T)

8. Within the parentheses, all values are 'or'd together. Since 'T' is present, whole expression becomes 'T' because 'or' operation is true if any one operand is true. So, the statement further simplifies to:

   ((z&(T))|F)|((z&(!(T&F)))&T)

9. 'T' & 'F' simplifies to 'F', gives us:

   ((z&(T))|F)|((z&(!F))&T)

10. '!F' simplifies to 'T', so the statement becomes:

    ((z&(T))|F)|((z&T)&T)

11. The expression 'z&T' simplifies to 'z', since anything 'and' with True remains the same. We now have:

    ((z&T)|F)|(z&T)

12. Replace 'z&T' with 'z' we have:

    (z|F)|(z&T)

13. The 'or' operation between any value and False will result in the original value itself, which leaves us with:

    z|(z&T)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the expression by eliminating and reducing the unnecessary logical operations, mainly observe that :

1) ""A & True"" is equivalent to ""A"" and ""A | True"" is ""True"" always.
2) ""A & False"" is ""False"" and ""| False"" is ""A"" always.
3) ""!False"" is ""True"" and ""!True"" is ""False"" always.
4) ""F & (anything)"" or ""(anything) & F"" is ""False"" always.
5) ""(True | T)"" (or any logic OR operation with True involved) is always ""True"".

Using these rules simplify the formula:

((a&(T&(((F&(F|T))&T)|T)))|(!(((a&(((!(!(F|(T|T))))&(T|(!((T&T)|F))))|T))&a)&F)))

Simplyfiying the terms expanding (F|T), (T&T) and (T|T) into T.

((a&(T&(((F&T)&T)|T)))|(!(((a&(((!(T))&T|(!(T|F))))|T))&a)&F)))

Solving the value for F&T which is always F.

((a&(T&((F&T)|T)))|((!(((a&(((!(T))&T|(!T))|T))&a))&F)))

Solving the &(anything) where ""anything"" is True, which is equivalent to ""anything"".

Now,
((a&T)|(!(((a&((!T&T|F)|T))&a)&F)))

Apply the rule of ""A & True"" is to ""A"", cancel out T.

(a|(!(((a&((!T&T|F))|T)&a)&F)))

Anything OR with True will be True, therefore, X | T becomes T.

(a|(!(((a&((!T&F)|T))&a)&F)))

Solve ""F | Anything"", which is ""Anything"".

(a|(!(((a&(!T|T))&a)&F)))

Negation of True is False, so replace !T with F.

(a|(!(((a&(F|T))&a)&F)))

Solve for F | T, which is always T.

(a|(!(((a&T)&a)&F)))

Solving (A & True) and (A & A), we get (A & A)

(a|(!((a&a)&F)))

Since a = a, it simplifies to,

(a|(!(a&F)))

Finally, (A & False), simplifies to False, so the final result is,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Firstly, you can simplify the innermost expressions where expressions are ""AND"" with True 'T' and ""OR"" with False 'F'.

So, you may simplify expressions like (c&T) as (c), (F|c) as (c), and so forth.

2) Since True 'T' ""OR"" with anything gives True 'T', you may simplify such expressions by keeping only True 'T'. So, (T|(T&c)) can be simplified as T.

3) Similarly, ""NOT"" of False 'F' gives True 'T', and ""NOT"" of True 'T' provides False 'F'. So, (!F) can be simplified as T and (!T) can be simplified as F.

3. (F | X) equals X,
4. (!F) equals T,

Using the above, we can simplify the given formula:

1. Innermost simplification ((F&(F&T))|T) can be reduced to (F|T) equals T,

2. So, ((e|(F|T)) & (...)) equals (e&T) which simplifies to e,

3. Then, we have (!((q&F)&((!T)|(T|F))))|F which simplifies to (!F)|F equals T|F, which is T,

=>(F|(!(!((((o|(o&o))|F)&((o&(((o|(F&F))&(o|(o|o)))&(o|F)))&o))&F))))

2. Substituting !F (not False) as T.
3. Since anything OR'ed (|) by T or AND'ed (&) by F can be reduced and anything or OR'ed with F becomes itself like m | F becomes m. So substituting wherever you see these conditions.
4. Note that when a literal is OR'd with itself, it stays the same (i.e., m | m simplifies to m).
5. Similarly, when a literal is AND'd with itself, it stays the same (i.e., m & m simplifies to m).
6. Anything AND'ed by True remains the same. So, m & T becomes m.

3. Thus, the expression l | (F & F) & False is equivalent to l | False & False which further simplifies to l.
4. (T|l|T), considering the fact that ""or"" operation with T is always True, the expression reduces to True. Hence, the left part of the main 'and' operation becomes True.
5. Then consider (x | (i & F)) | F. The expression i & F simplifies to False, hence, the expression simplifies to x | False which is x. 
6. The right part of the main 'and' operation (x | F) & F & T simplifies to False & T which is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can perform several simplifications based on the known values of T and F, and the properties of logical connectives:

- Any value (let's call it 'X') OR-ed with T becomes T.
- Any value AND-ed with T remains the same value.
- Any value OR-ed with F stays the same.
- Any value AND-ed with F becomes F.
- The negation of T (!T) is F and the negation of F (!F) is T.

Applying these rules and tidying up parentheses, we can rewrite our formula as:

(t|(t&T))&(t&(p&F|F|T&T))|t)

This simplifies further:

(t&t) & (t & ((F|F) | T)) | t

Which simplifies to:

t & (t & (F | T)) | t

That becomes:

t & (t & T) | t

This in turn simplifies to:

t & t | t

The OR operator is commutative, so we can rearrange:

(t & t) | t = t | (t & t)

But t & t is t, therefore it reduces to:

t | t

This in turn simplifies down to:

- (T & T) always equals T.
- (!T) always equals F.
- (T | F) always equals T.
- (F | F) always equals F.
- (T | F | F) always equals T.

So, the formula becomes:

((j & ((a | T) | (a | T))) & T)

Next, we can simplify the operation (a | T), which always equals T since True dominates OR operation:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) First of all, anything OR True is always True, so we can deduce that any piece of the formula having ""|T"" into it will turn into True. Also, anything AND True will remain the same. So the formula simplifies to:

Which further simplifies to:

T&T)|(F&(!(d|(!F))).

2) Secondly, anything AND False is always False and anything OR False will remain the same. Moreover, logical NOT (!) will change True into False and vice versa. So we can simplify the second half of the formula.

F&(!(d|(!F))) becomes F&&!d since !F turns to T and anything OR T becomes T therefore !(d|T) turns into !d. 

So the formula simplifies to:

T&T|(F&&!d).

""T&T"" turns into T and ""F&&!d"" turns into F because F and anything is F.

2. With similar knowledge, AND operation between any literal and T always results in the literal itself, if we have AND operation between any literal and F, the result will be F.

2. Any expression followed by '& T' simply results in that expression. So we can remove all '& T' from the formula.

3. Any expression followed by '& F' will always be F since something AND False will always give False.

- F&x: AND operation with False gives False, regardless the other operand. Therefore, F&x = F for any literal x.
- x&x: AND operation between the same literals gives the literal itself, meaning x&x = x.
- x|F: OR operation with False gives the original literal or value it was made with. Therefore, x|F = x for any literal x.
- x&x: AND operation in two equal literals or values results in the same literal or value. So, x&x = x.

- We get ((F) & (T|another_expression)) where another_expression is the remaining part.

- ""(F&F)"" is always ""F""

So replace in the formula: 

(((F&((F)&((((o&T)&((T)|((T|(F))&(T&(T)))))&T)&(T&F))))|T)&(F|((F)|T)))

Now, apply the logical rules again. 

- We know that expression ""F&T"" would be “F” for any ""T"". So eliminate those expressions in the formula: 

(((F&((F)&((((o&F)&((T)|((T|(F))&(F)))))&F)))|T)&(F|((F)|T)))

- Expression ""F&F"" would be false for any input. Hence

(((F&((F)&((((F)&((T)|((T|(F))&(F)))))&F)))|T)&(F|F|T))

- ""T|(F)"" is always true. ""T|T"" which is always true

((F&F&F)|T)&T

- ""(F&F&F)"" yields to False, since ""F&T"" is always false. Hence,

Replace `T&T` with `T` and `F|T` with `T`.

2. In the brackets we see operations like ""F | (...)"" and ""T & (...)"". They are irrelevant, since the result of or operation with F and and operation with T is determined by the second argument. So we simplify operations with them:

F is always F, so it doesn't matter with what we meet it — the result will always be F. Hence, ""(l & F)"" is always F and it gives us that ""T & (l & F)"" is also F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can start by simplifying the redundant logical expression by removing the logical OR (""|"") parts that contain F and logical AND (""&"") parts that contain T, as they don't change the value of the expression.

(i & (i | F)) simplifies to (i & i), which is simply i.
(g | (g | F)) simplifies to g.
(g | (z & F)) simplifies to g (since z & F always results in F).
(d | F) simplifies to d.
(w | (!F)) simplifies to w (since !F is always true).

Similarly, any expression ORed with T (""expression | T"") is always true, so we simplify those too.

The logic (!F) & T simplifies into T.

Thus our expression simplifies to:
!((!(i & g & T) | T) & w)

The part (i & g & T) will be equal to the value of (i & g), as ANDing with True doesn't alter the expression. 

So we end up with:
!((!(i & g) | T) & w)

Now, because anything ORed with True is always True, we can simplify the inside of the not:
!(T & w) 

This will be False, if w is True, and True otherwise. To express this in terms of w, we can say that it's equal to the negation of w:
!w

So, the simplified logic formula is !w.",!w,F

  c. The expression !((F|True)&T) equals to True, because True or False is True, True and True is True, negation of True is False.

Now, we have:
((!T)&((T&((T&T)&((!False)&((T&False)&F))))|(T|(T&T))).

2. In the expression above:
  a. ((!T)&(...)) equals to False, because negation of True is False and False and anything is False.

  c. T|(T&T) equals to True, because True or anything (even False) is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that the expression ""(z|(z|(z|z)))"" simplifies to ""z"". This is due to the simple logic rule that says 'A OR A is always equal to A'.

Then, notice that the expression ""(((z&z)|F)"" simplifies to ""z"". This is due to 'A AND A is equal to A' and 'A OR False is equal to A'.

Also, observe that the expression ""((T&(F&(T&T)))&((F|(F|F))|F))"" simplifies to ""F"". This is because 'False AND any boolean is always False' and 'Any boolean AND False is always False'.

Then, observe that ""F&(T&F)"" simplifies to ""F"". This is because 'False AND any boolean is always False'. 

And, notice that the expression ""(((z&F)&(!F)&T)| F)"" simplifies to ""F"". This is because 'Any boolean AND False is always False'. 

So, the final expression becomes ""(z & z & T)"" which simplifies to ""(z & T)"" as 'A AND A is equal to A'. If T is interpreted as True and z is any boolean variable, the final expression means that the result is equal to z, because 'A AND True is equal to A'. 

Therefore, ""((z|(z|(z|z)))&(((((((z&z)|F)&(!((T&(F&(T&T)))&((F|(F|F))|F))))&T)|(F&(T&F)))&z)&T))"" simplifies to ""z"".",z,z

3. The expression F|!T evaluates to F because !T is False.

   So, ((l|(((l|((F|((p|F)&F))|F)&F)))|F)&l))|(F|((F|T)|T))

4. As or operation with F results in the same element and and operation with F results in F. This further simplifies the formula to:

4. T|(!(T&F)) => T (since T&F = T&false = false, hence negating it = true; true or anything = true)

3. Therefore, (t|(!(F&(F&T)))) can be simplified to (t|True), which equals to True. This is because NOT operator of False AND something will give True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, we can simplify the boolean constants in the formula:

1. F|T will be T since OR operation with a True value is always True.
2. F&F will be F since AND operation with a False value is always False.
3. T&F will be F since AND operation with a False value is always False.
4. F|(q&(T&F)) will be F|q&F ,and then simplifies to F.

So, now the initial expression looks as follows:

(((((x|F)|x)&(x|(((x&((T&F)|T))&(F))|(T&F))))&x)|F)

Second, let's simplify the duplicates:

1. (x|F)|x will be x because OR operation with a False value is similar to operand itself and hurts it no way.
2. ((x&F)|T) will be (F|T) since AND operation with a False value is always False. This also simplifies to T.

Now the expression looks as follows:

((x&(x|(x&T)&F)&x)|F)

And finally, we can reduce the AND with False and OR with False:

((x&F&x)|F) will become F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we should simplify the given expression to its simplest form.

Step 1: Apply logical identities.

Remember, (T & x) => x (AND operation with True always yields the existing variable) Also, (T | x) => T (OR operation with True always yields True) And, (!T) => F (NOT operation with True gives False).

So (((g&(T|(!T)))&T)|T) => (g & (T | F)) & T | T => (g & T) & T | T => g & T | T => g | T. Therefore simplified expression is g | T

Let's also simplify (T|(F&T)), This simplifies into T | (F & T) => T | F => T. Therefore the negation of this simplified expression is !T which yields F.

Overall, we have
!((T|(F&T))|T) => !(T | T) => !T => F.

Substitute these results back into the expression, replacing the longer subsequences.

The expression now becomes:
((T&(T&((T&((!(!(T))&(g | T)))|(F))))
|((T&(w|T))|T)).

Remember (F & x) => F (AND operation with False gives False).

Step 2: Keep simplifying.

((T&(T&((T&((!(F)&(g | T)))|F))))
|((T&(w|T))|T)).
=> ((T&(T&((T&((T)&(T | g)))|F))))
=> (T&(T&(T&((T)&(T|g))|F)))
=> (T&(T&(T&(T | g) | F)))
=> (T&(T&(T|(T | g) | F)))
=> (T & (T & T | T | g | F))
=> (T & (T | T | g | F))
=> (T | g | F).

Step 3: Simplify further.

(T | g | F) => T | g => T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!F) is equivalent to T, so every time we see a negation of F or (!F), we can replace it with T.

2. The action ""&F"" produces always False independent of the other term, because ""anything AND False"" is equal to False. So, any expression inside brackets that contain &F can be removed and replaced with F.

3. Similarly, the action ""|T"" always produces True, because ""anything OR True"" is equal to True. So, any expression inside brackets that contain |T can be removed and replaced with T. 

4. (!T) returns False and (T&(!T)) returns False because ""True AND False"" is False.

Applying the rules above, the original formula becomes this:

NOT((o&F)|(!F)|False)

Next, F&anything = F and F|anything = anything. So we get:

Secondly, consider the inner term ((F&((T)|F)). Because the F in the expression is ""and"" with other terms, we assume the whole term is F.

Similarly, ((u&((f|T)&(F|F)))&F), because the F in the expression is ""and"" with other terms, it's also F. We also have another F with an ""or"", so that would be F. Since the term is ""and"" with T afterwards, it's also F. This F is then finally ""and"" with (!F), but not F is T, so the overall term (T&F) turns into F due to AND semantics.

Finally, ((F&F)|F) is clearly F, as ""and"" with multiple Fs results in F, and ""or"" with F also results in F. 

So, after simplification, the expression turns into:

The expression in this bracket (((T|((T|T)&T))&(!(!(F|T)))))|T is equivalent to T, because anything OR true is always true. 

Also, anything AND false is always false, hence (((T|((T|T)&T))&(!(!(F|T)))))&F) will be equal to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. In logical formulas, the ampersand ""&"" operator returns True only if both sides are True. So any expression involving True will return the other side's value. Thus, simplify ""p&p"" and ""T&T"" to ""p"" and ""T"", respectively. 

2. Not False ""!F"" equals True. So replace ""!F"" with ""T"".

3. Any expression OR-ed with False ""F|anything"" will return the other side's value, while anything OR-ed with True ""T|anything"" will return True.

4. The expression ""((T|(T|T)))"" can be simplified to ""T"" because anything OR-ed with True equals True. 

5. ""!(T)"" equals False as logical not of True is False. 

6. The expression ""a|a"" simplifies to ""a"" because any value logically OR-ed with itself equals itself. 

7. ""T&F"" simplifies to ""F"" because anything AND-ed with False equals False, as the expression is only True if both values are True. 

8. Apply the aforementioned steps repeatedly to the entire formula, and the simplified logic formula becomes: 

((p&T)&(T&T)&T&p), which can be further simplified to:

p&p, which is just ""p"".",p,p

(!((F|((l|((((l&((l|F)&T))|l)&l)&((F&(F|(T|(F&T))))|T)))|T))|(!(!((y|y)&F))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F or Anything = Anything. So, F|(T|(F&T)) simplifies to T|(F&T). 

2. Similarly, Any value AND with False (F) gives False. So, F&(F|(T|(F&T))) simplifies to F. 

3. F or T = T. So, F|T simplifies to T.

4. Now, coming to the inner-most terms, l|F = l, F|T = T, so l|(l|F) becomes l|l = l, and F|T simplifies to T. 

5. At the same time,  (l|(l&F)) simplifies to l only because l AND with False gives False. 

6. Then, l AND with T gives l, l OR l gives l and, l AND with l gives l. So the first l|((((l&((l|F)&T))|l)&l) simplifies to l.

7. Now, as we got l|T gives T, and F AND l gives False. So, (F&(F|(T|(F&T))))|T simplifies to T. 

8. Finally, combining these results, we get T or !(!(y|y)&F), this in turn simplifies to T, because anything  OR with T gives True. 

9. Finally, !(!T) simplifies to True. Therefore, your logic formula simplifies to True.",T,F

((!(((e&((e|((((e|e)&(l|T))&e)&(e|(e|e))))|((e&e)|e)))|(F&(F&F)))|T))|(!((T|F)&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's understand few fundamental rules of Boolean algebra, which are similar in this logic formula:

1. X | T = T, because ""or"" with True is always True 

2. X & F = F, because ""and"" with False is always False 

3. X|X = X, because ""or"" with itself keeps the value 

4. X&X = X, because ""and"" with itself keeps the value 

5. !(T) = F, because ""not"" inverts the value 

6. !(F) = T, because ""not"" inverts the value 

Considering these rules, let's simplify this formula step-by-step:

((!(((e&((e|((((e|e)&(l|T))&e)&(e|(e|e))))|((e&e)|e)))|(F&(F&F)))|T))|(!((T|F)&T))) = 

= ((!(((e&((e|((e&(l|T))&e)&(e|e)))|(e|e)))|F)|T)|(!(T&T))) (apply rules 3 & 4 to (e|e), ((e|e)&(l|T))&e, (e&e) separate blocks) 

= ((!(((e&((e|(e&e))&e))|e))|F)|T)|(!T) (apply rule 4 to (e|(e|(e&e)))

= (((!((e&e)&e))|e))|F)|T)|F (apply rule 2 to the second part of the first block to get F)

= (((!(e&e))|e))|T)|F (apply rule 4 to ((e&e)&e))

= (!e | e)|T|F ( |e in the end then remove the inner brackets)

= T|T|F (apply rule 3 to (!e | e) to get T)

Therefore, the final simplified form of this logic formula is T, which mean it's always True.",T,F

((j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T))&(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, consider operations with binary operators and constants (T and F):

- X|F = X
- X|T = T
- X&F = F
- X&T = X
- X&!X = F
- X|!X = T
- !F = T
- !T = F

Also remember T|T = T and T&T=T.

Then, ((j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T))&(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T)) simplifies as follows:

1. Replace ((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T)) with F and (((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))) with F
   => (j&T)&((T&!(i|!F)|F)|T)
   
2. Simplify T&!(i|!F) to T&!i and j&T to j
   => j&(T&!i|T)

3. T&!i simplifies to !i, and (T&!i|T) simplifies to T
   => j&T 

4. Finally, by applying the rule X&T = X, the result is:
   => j.",j.,j
99,logic,self_consistency,(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively.

(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T | F = T always.
2. !T = F always.
3. F | T = T always.
4. T | T = T.

We can rewrite the original equation using the information above:

(((s&(T|(!T)))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!F))&((h|(((!F)|T)|T)))&F)&T))))

5. !F = T
6. T & F = F
7. x | T = T
8. x & F = F
9. T | !T = T

Rearrange the equation again:

(((s&(T|F))&s)|(s|(s&(((o&T)&(h|T))&F))))

10. T & x = x
11. x | F = x

Result:

(((s&T)&s)|(s|(s&F))) => ((s&s)|(s|F)) => (s|s) => s

So, the simplified logical formula is s.",s,s
