A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly think about the principles of binary logic. If you take any value (either True or False) and apply logical ""or"" with False (value|F), it doesn't change the value, it stays the same. So, T|F simplifies to T, and in the same sense, any value t and T|F simplifies to T & t, that is, your expression, ((T&((t&(T|F))&F))&((!((T|T)|F))&T)) simplifies to ((T&(t&F))&((!((T|T)|F))&T))

In binary logic, if you apply logical ""or"" with True (value|T), the result is always True, no matter the original value. Hence T|T simplifies to T, and an expression of identical values linked with logical ""or"" also simplifies to a single such value. Therefore, ((T&(t&F))&((!((T|T)|F))&T)) simplifies to ((T&(t&F))&((!T)&T)).

The logical ""not"" applied to True (!T) is False. So, ((T&(t&F))&((!T)&T)) simplifies to ((T&(t&F))&(F&T)).

Again, any value ""anded"" with False (value&F) is always False. So both (t&F) and (F&T) simplifies to F.
So, ((T&(t&F))&(F&T)) simplifies to ((T&F)&(F&T)), which simplifies further to (F&F)

Finally, identical values linked with logical ""and"" simplifies to a single such value. Thus, F&F becomes F.

Hence, the simplified logic formula is F.",F,F

Thus, the expression becomes: 
`(!(T|((F|T)|(!T)))`

2. Continuing, `F|T` is T (False or True is True).

- T | F = T (the expression is true if at least one operand is True)

- (a | T) =  T (the expression is true if at least one operand is True)

- T & T = T (the expression is true if and only if both operands are true)
- (r & F) = F (since False and any value results in False)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify the expression in the parentheses that contains the Or statement with the False values, which is (F|F). The result of Or is False if both operands are False. So we can replace (F|F) with F.

We then have: 
((c|((c|F)|(c|(c&T))))&((c|c)&T))

Next, the expression (c|F) can be simplified. In an Or operation, if either of the operands is True, the result will be True. So, when one of the operands is F (False), the other operand decides the value of the expression. We can simplify (c|F) to c.

We then have: 
((c|(c|(c|(c&T))))&((c|c)&T))

We should note here that c OR c is always just c, because the same value OR'd with itself doesn't change.

So now the expression becomes: 
((c|(c|(c&T)))&(c&T))

In the expression (c|(c&T)), the value of the expression will be true if c is True, regardless of whether (c&T) is True or False. So we can simplify (c|(c&T)) to c.

We then have: 
((c|c)&(c&T))

We can further simplify (c|c) as just ""c"", just as we did before. 

So the final expression can be simplified to : 
(c&(c&T))

The way the AND operator works, is if any part of the expression is False, the whole thing is False. In other words, ""c AND c AND T"" really just simplifies to ""c AND T"". This is because additional instances of ""c"" don't change the outcome; if c is True, the AND operation will consider the T; if c is False, the whole statement is False, no matter how many times ""c"" is mentioned.

So the expression becomes: = (((c|F)&(c|F))|T)|(F|T)

So, the expression becomes: (((c&c)|T)|T)

Next, is to simplify c & c as c because a logical value AND-ed with itself is itself.

Plugging these results into the formula, we get:

Next, we simplify the equations in the parentheses. Since False and True results in False:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider the parentheses containing T and F. 

F & (T & T) simplifies to F (because anything AND False is False), and ((c | T) & T) simplifies to T (because anything OR True is True, so you have True AND True, which is True).

Therefore, our original formula simplifies to:

(((l | F) | l) & (l & T))

Again, you can simplify l | F to just l (because anything OR False still remains the original value), and l & T simplifies to l (because anything AND True still remains the original value). 

So the simplified logic formula becomes:

(l | l) & l

Finally, we can simplify l | l to just l, making our final simplified logic formula:

l & l

(((((g&g)|g)|((g&T)&T))&(g|F))&(T|F)) becomes

Secondly, since g&g = g, and since we know that A | A = A, the formula simplifies to:

4. 'k' OR True will always be True, regardless of the truth value of 'k'.

5. Now we have: !(F|e|T). The OR operation is associative so this equals to: !(T) or even simpler !T.

This gives:

(r|F). 

Finally, r or F is equal to r because even if r is False, the whole formula does not change because logical OR of r with False again give r. 

So the simplified version of the formula is r.",r,r

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!(((F|F)|F)|F)) can be simplified to T, because any value OR'd with F is the value itself, and negating F gives T. 

2. (F|(h|(w|T))) simplifies to T, because anything OR'd with T is T.

3. Therefore, ((F|(h|(w|T)))&F) simplifies to F, because anything AND'd with F is F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. In the formula, replace ""T & T & T"" with ""T"". Because ""T & T = T"".
   So, the formula becomes ""(!((T&(F|(T&F)))&(!T)))"".

2. Then replace in the formula ""T & F"" with ""F"". Because ""T & F = F"".
   So, the formula becomes ""(!((T&(F|F))&(!T)))"".
   
3. Replace in the formula ""F | F"" with ""F"". Because ""F | F = F"".
   So, the formula becomes ""(!((T&F)&(!T)))"".

4. Then replace ""T & F"" with ""F"". Because ""T & F = F"".
   So, the formula becomes ""(!(F&(!T)))"".

5. Replace ""F & (!T)"" with ""F"". Because whatever is the value of T will not change the result of AND operation with False.
   So, the formula becomes ""(!F)""

6. Replace ""!F"" with ""T"". Because NOT operation flips the value of F (False) to True.

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, according to logical rules, (F&F) is equivalent to F. Thus we can rewrite the formula to:
(((l&(T|F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F))).

Then, (T | F) is equivalent to T. Similarly, (d & F) is equivalent to F. The formula becomes:
(((l&T)|l)|(F&(!(F&F)))).

Next (l&T) is equivalent to l, and (F&F) is equivalent to F, so we have:
((l|l)|(F&(!F))).

(l | l) is equivalent to l and (F&!F) is equivalent to F, so we get:
(l | F).

Finally, (l | F) is equivalent to l, so the simplified formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","In the formula, T stands for True and F stands for False. 

Let's rewrite the formula using these values:

((True&(True&(o&(True&False))))|(k&((True&(False&False))|False))).

Using the semantic of:
- logical and operation: True & False = False, True & True = True, False & False = False.
- logical or operation: True | False = True, True | True = True, False | False = False. 

Let's now simplify the formula: 

((True&(True&(o&(True&False))))|(k&((True&(False&False))|False)))

Notice that (True&False) equals False, and (False&False) equals False:

==> ((True&(True&(o&False)))|(k&((True&False)|False)))

Then, (True&o&False) equals False because (True&False) equals False and True & o could be either True or False but in both cases if we and with False the result is False:

==> ((True&False)|(k&((True&False)|False)))

Then, True&False equals False:

==> (False|(k&False))

Lastly, notice that (k&False) equals False:

==> (False|False) 

Thus finally, False|False equals False.

Now let's simplify this expression:
- f|F=f for the first operation 
- F|h&F = F because h&F=F , F|F=F

Again simplify this expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The negative operator ""!"" inverts the truth value of the element it is used with. Therefore,

!T becomes false,
!!F is equal to false and,

Also, False or Clouse is equal to Clouse and True or Clouse is always true.

Thus, simplification is as follows:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that the logical not of True (!T) immediately becomes False. Also, False or False (F | F) just gives us False, whereas False or True (F | T) always gives us True.

Therefore we can simplify as follows:
((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F))).  

Becomes

((F)|(False|T)|(True&F))).

False or False gives us False, so we can replace (F|F) with F.
False and anything (&) gives us False, so we can replace ((!T)&(F|F)) with F, and (True&F) with F.
False or True gives us True, so we can replace (False|T) with T.

Replace all these into our original equation and we get F|T|F. 

Finally, False or True gives True. So the whole equation simplifies to T or in more understandable terms, True.",T,T
