0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The ""or"" operator means that if either of the operands (the values on the sides of the operator) is true, then the entire operation is true. Since ""T"" is true, the operation (h|T) will be true no matter what value ""h"" has. So the simplified formula is:
T",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula is (F|T). This represents the logical or operation between False and True. As per the truth table for logical or operation, the result is True even if one of the operands is True. Here, the second operand is True. 

So, the simplified form of the logic formula (F|T) is T.",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Since T stands for True in logic, when any value is logically and (&) with True, the output will be the value itself. 

It means any value directly and with True does not change its value.

Therefore, the simplified form for (v&T) will be (v).",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","""o | F"" means ""o OR False"". According to the rules of logic, any statement ""o OR False"" is always equal to ""o"". Therefore, the simplified form of the formula is ""o"".",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.",The simplification of the logic expression (q|F) will be just q. The OR operation with False will not alter the original value.,q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","An AND operation (represented by &) only results in True if both operands are True. In this case, one of the operands is False (F), which means that the whole expression simplifies to False, regardless of the value of f. So, the simplified logic formula is:

F",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The result of logical and (&) operation in this case (w&w) is simply ""w"", because ""w"" AND ""w"" will always be ""w"".",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The statement is essentially saying ""b OR False."" The OR logical operator (|) returns True if either or both of its inputs are True. Here, we know that F (False) is not True, so the result of the operation falls to the value of 'b'. Therefore, the statement simplifies to just 'b'.",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (o|o) can be simplified as follows:

The formula states that ""o"" OR ""o"" is true. Since OR logic states that if any of the literals in an OR statement are true, the entire statement results in true, repeatedly stating ""o"" does not change the outcome. 

Therefore, (o|o) simplifies to just ""o"".",o,o
