A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, look at the section, 
((q&T)|(!T))
T (True) value always makes the whole OR operation true. So (!T) means it's false. This OR operation returns false. But when we combine it with (q&T), it will return q's value as T is always true when combined with AND. So, the overall result is q.

Then, no matter what value q is, when we combine it with F (False) in an OR operation, the result will still be q. 
Following that, no matter what value q is, when combined with T (True) in an OR operation, the result will always be T.
However, negating this result by (!) would give us F (False).

So now, we have F (False) on the left side of our original expression, and the right side expression to solve for:

((((!T)&F)|F)|F)
!T returns F (False), and combining that with an AND operation with another F (False) would also return F (False). No matter how many times we combine F (False) with an OR, it will still return F (False).

Since any value OR True (value|T)equals True and False AND any value equals False (F&value = F), we can further simplify this to:
i&((false|T)|F)
i&(T|F)
i&T 

Note that any value AND True (value&T) equals the value itself, so ""i&T"" can be simplified to i.

Now we turn to the right side of the formula: T&(c&(!T))

Negation of True is False, so (!T) equals False. False AND any value equals False. Therefore, the right side of the equation equals to False (T&F = F).

(T|(T&T)) simplifies to (T|T) which gives T.

(F&F) equals to F, so ((F&F)&(v&F)) transforms to (F&(v&F)) and then to (F&F), that results in F.

2. Any value OR-ed with itself is equal to itself, so replace ""(y|y)"" with ""y"". The y in the parentheses simplifies to y as ""((y&y)) = y"" and ""(y|y) = y"".

3. Any value AND-ed with True is equal to the value itself, so replace ""(T&T)"" with ""T"".

4. Any value OR-ed with True is always True, so replace ""(w|T)"" with ""T"".

So, in the expression, we can see two parts essentially: (((((n&(n&T))&T)&n)|n) and ((((n|(o&(!T)))|F)|F)).

((n&(n&T)) simplifies to (n&n = n).

(n&T) will give n.

(n&n) will give n.

(n|n) will take the union of 'n',  which gives n.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression in question is:

(!((x|x)&((!(T|(T&F)))&(F|((!T)|F)))))

1. Simplify (T&F). This results in F because both values have to be true in an ""and"" operation.

2. Simplify (!T). This is F because the negation of true is false.

So, our expression is:

3. Simplify (!F). This is T because the negation of false is true.

Our expression now becomes:

4. Simplify (!T|F). This is T because the ""or"" operation only needs one true value.

Starting with the first part of the formula: ((T&T)&F). The truth value of (T & T) is T. Therefore, ((T&T)&F) is equivalent to (T&F), which results in F.

The second part of the formula: T&((f&(f&(T|F)))&(j&((F&F)&F))). The truth value of (T|F) is T. Therefore, (f&(f&(T|F))) is equivalent to (f&(f&T)), which ultimately simplifies to (f&f) and results in f. 

The next part: j&((F&F)&F), this simplifies to (F&F) which simplifies further to F. Therefore, T&((f&(f&(T|F)))&(j&((F&F)&F))) simplifies to  T&f&F. Using logical and, T&F results in F and thus the whole expression simplifies to F.

- j|T is T because if j is either true or false, the OR with true always results in true.
- x & F simplifies to F because True & False = False and False & False = False. This is the base principle of AND; if either value is false, then the AND result is false.

- (!T) is equal to ""not true"", which is F (False)
- (T&F) is equal to ""true and false"", which is F (False).
- (anything | F) is equal to ""anything or false"", which just simplifies to ""anything"". So (v|F) simplifies to v, and (d|T|F) simplifies to d|T, and since anything or true is true, it ultimately simplifies to T.
- Now replace these in the original expression, and we have ((v&(v))&(n&(F&T))) which simplifies to ((v&v)&(n&F)).

The term ""!F"" is equal to ""T"" (not False equals True).
