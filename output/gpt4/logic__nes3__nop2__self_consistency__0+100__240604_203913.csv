Then, we know t&t could be either True or False because these are arbitrary literal values. However, regardless of the truth value of t, we know that (F|T) will always be True because | is a logical OR operator; if either value is true, the whole statement is true.

So, ((t&t)|(F|T)) simplifies to (t&t) | True because (F|T) is always True.

Then, following the same explanation of the logical OR operator, this operation will always be True regardless of the truth value of (t&t).

After these substitutions, ((!F)|((t&t)|(F|T))) finally simplifies to T | True, which is just T because as long as one of the values in an OR operation is True, the whole expression is True.

(o & T) & (!(F & F)).

F & F = F (This is because logical 'and' is only true when both operand are true.)

So the equation simplifies to:
(o & T) & (!F).

!F = T (This is logical 'not', it flips the value of the operand)

So the equation simplifies to:
(o & T) & T.

Next, logical 'and' with true value doesn't alter the other operand. Meaning, any value logical 'and' with T results in the same value. o & T will give us o and similarly, any value & T = same value.

o & T.

1. (F&F) - This is 'False AND False'. According to the rule of 'AND' operation in logic, an expression is True if and only if every single part of it is True. Here, both parts are False, so the result is False.

2. T - The second part of the expression is simply 'True'.

3. (F&(!F)) - This is 'False AND NOT False'. 'NOT False' is True. However, remember the rule of 'AND' - if any part of the expression is False, the entire thing is False. Here, the first part is False, so even though the second part is True, the result is False.

Now we can simplify the entire expression. 

(((F&F)&T)&(F&(!F))) becomes ((False&True)&False) according to the results we just found.

1) w&w can be simplified to w because if w is True, w&w would be True and if w is False, w&w would be False.

2) T|F can be simplified to T. This is because in a logical OR operation, if either operand is True, the result is True. Here since T represents True, the result of T|F will be T.

Hence, the simplified expressions are:

i) (w | F)
ii) !(T)

The formula now reads: ((w | F) | !(T)).

Simplifying further we have:

1) w | F simplifies to w, since in a logical OR operation, if either operand is True, the result is True. When either operand can be False (as is the case with w), the result depends solely on the non-False operand. Here the non-False operand is w.

2) !T can be simplified to F. This is because in a NOT(!) operation, the result is the opposite of the operand. Here, since T represents True, the result of !T would be the opposite, i.e., False (F).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Remember that logical not changes the value of its operand, so (!F) equals T.
2. The logical and operator (&) if used with True value doesn't change the value of its other operand. So (q&(!F)) equals (q&T) and finally equals q.
3. The logical or operator (|) if used with at least one True value gives True. So ((T|T)|T) simplifies to T.
4. Bringing it all together, the original expression ((q&(!F))&((T|T)|T)) simplifies to (q&T) which is equal to q.",q,q

Then, ""(s|s)"" is also just ""s"". 

So, ""((s&s)|s)"" simplifies to ""s"" in the first part of the formula.

Moreover, ""(T|T)"" is just ""T"". 

And as any value logically AND with True remains the same, ""(s&(T|T))"" is just ""s"" as well.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!F) evaluates to True, because it denotes ""NOT False"", so it is True.
2. (F|T) evaluates to True, because it stands for ""False OR True"", and even if one part of an OR-statement is True, the whole statement is True.

4. (T&F) evaluates to False, as this stands for ""True AND False"". In an AND-statement, if any part is False, the whole statement is False.

Let's substitute that back into the formula:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the T&T operation. Since T&T always equals True, the formula becomes:

((c|F)|((c|F)&T)).

Next, consider that something & T also equals that something itself, as anything logically ANDed with True is itself. So now our expression is:

((c|F)|c|F).

Luckily, anything OR-ed with False also equals itself. This gives us:

c|c.

And finally, any value OR-ed with itself equals itself. Therefore, the simplified formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The first group (T&T) results in T (True & True = True)

3. The groups (i&T) and (i&T) also result in truth value of i (i&True = i) if i is True and False if i is False.
4. So, the formula becomes ((i&i)&i), because both occurrences of (i&T) are simplified to i.
5. Then, the formula simplifies further to just i (i&i&i = i). Remembering that if i is True, (True&True&True = True). and if i is False, (False&False&False = False).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First consider (T&F) which gives F (False) because it's an ""and"" operation and for an ""and"" operation to be True both values have to be True. If either of them is False, then the entire expression is False.

Second, consider (l&F) which gives F because one of the values is False and this operation is an ""and"" operation.

Next, consider ((c&c)|T). Here, regardless of the value of (c&c), the result would be True, because in an ""or"" operation, if either of the values is True, then it returns True. Here we have T (True) hence the entire expression is T.

Finally, consider ((c&c)|T)&(l&(T&F)). Now that we have evaluated the values in brackets before, we can substitute: (T&F) which gives us F since it's an ""and"" operation.

The next part of the expression becomes (o | (T & T)). Here, we have an OR operation between o and the result of T AND T. Since T AND T results into T, it simplifies to (o | T). 

(o | T) means o OR True. In logic, if one part of an OR operation is True, the whole expression is True no matter what the other part is. Therefore, (o | T) simplifies to T.

So, the initial formula simplifies to (T & T), which results to T or True. So, the simplified logical formula is T.",T,T
