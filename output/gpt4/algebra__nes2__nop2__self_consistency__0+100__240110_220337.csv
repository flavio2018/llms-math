Now, we're asked to compute the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient. The modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. So, in this case, we need to divide the coefficient, 87, by 100.

((+37*y+74*y)+(+94*y+64*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, look at ((+37*y+74*y)+(+94*y+64*y)). This expression can be rewritten as (37y + 74y + 94y + 64y).

Next, combine like terms: 37y + 74y + 94y + 64y = 269y.

Now, we need to find the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient 269.

The modulo operation finds the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number, so 269 mod 100 = 69.

Therefore, the resulting expression is: 69y.",69y,+69*y

((-7*a*b*x*y-60*a*b*x*y)+(-46*a*b*x*y-30*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify within the parentheses:

-7*a*b*x*y - 60*a*b*x*y = -67*a*b*x*y (mod 100 if it's positive, and mod -100 if negative)

-46*a*b*x*y - 30*a*b*x*y = -76*a*b*x*y (mod 100 if it's positive, and mod -100 if negative)

Then, add these results together:

-67*a*b*x*y + (-76*a*b*x*y) = -143*a*b*x*y (mod 100)

-143 mod -100 = -43.

So the simplified expression is -43*a*b*x*y.",-43*a*b*x*y,-43*a*b*x*y

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the parts in each set of parentheses:

(+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y) = -90*a*b*x*y, but we want the modulo -100, so it becomes -90.

(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y) = +30*a*b*x*y, but we want the modulo 100, so it becomes +30.

Finally, join these results:

-90*a*b*x*y + 30*a*b*x*y = -60*a*b*x*y, but we want the modulo -100, so it becomes -60.",-60*a*b*x*y,-60*a*b*x*y
