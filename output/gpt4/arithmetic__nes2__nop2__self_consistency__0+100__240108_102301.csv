((-71*80)+(94*25)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's calculate (-71*80). 
The result is -5680. 
Because it's negative, we calculate modulo(-100), which results in -80. 

Then, we calculate (94*25).
The result is 2350.
Since it's positive, we calculate modulo(100), which results in 50. 

Finally, let's add these two values: -80 + 50 = -30.
Because it's negative, we calculate modulo(-100), which results in -30. 

So, the result of the expression is -30.",-30,-30

((46*-82)+(68*98)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we compute the first multiplication: 

46 * -82 = -3772. However, since it's negative, we take modulo -100: -3772 mod -100 = -72. 

Next, we compute the second multiplication: 

68 * 98 = 6664, and taking modulo 100 gives us: 6664 mod 100 = 64. 

Now, we add the two intermediate results:

-72 + 64 = -8.

Since it's negative, we take modulo -100: 

-8 mod -100 = -8.

So the final answer to the expression is -8.",-8,-8

((-7*86)-(47-61)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, to get the value for (-7*86) modulo 100, take -7*86 = -602. Since this is negative, take modulo -100, which gives -2.

Next, we'll calculate (47-61) = -14. Modulo -100 of this, as it is negative, gives -14.

At this point, we have ((-2) - (-14)). Simplify this to -2 + 14 = 12. The final answer is 12, because 12 modulo 100 is simply 12.",12,12

So, the result is 85.",85,85
