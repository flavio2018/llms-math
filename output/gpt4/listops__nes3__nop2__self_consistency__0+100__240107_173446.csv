A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, determine [MAX 0 1], which gives us 1.

Second, determine [MIN 7 4], which gives us 4.

So the first part of the expression [MIN [MAX 0 1] [MIN 7 4]] becomes [MIN 1 4], so the minimum value is 1.

Determine [SM 8 4], which gives us 2 (because 8 + 4 = 12, and 12 modulo 10 is 2).

Determine [SM 9 3], which gives us 2 (because 9 + 3 = 12, and 12 modulo 10 is 2).

Then, the second part of the expression [SM [SM 8 4] [SM 9 3]] becomes [SM 2 2], so the sum is 4 (because 2 + 2 = 4).

Then, calculate the SM operation between 4 and 6:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we start inside the inner brackets. 

- [SM 5 4]: The operator SM means we add the numbers together and the result is modulo 10, so SM 5 4 = (5+4) mod 10 = 9.
- [MIN 5 4]: The operator MIN means we take the minimum of the two numbers, so MIN 5 4 = 4.
- [MIN 8 2]: Similar to above, MIN 8 2 = 2.
- [SM 0 9]: The operator SM means we add the numbers together and the result is modulo 10, so SM 0 9 = (0+9) mod 10 = 9.
