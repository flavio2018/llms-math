(((!F)|(F|T))&(T&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that, !F is equal to T. And (F|T) is T, because if either of them is true, then the statement is true. So, you have:

((T|T)&(T&F))

Next step, (T|T) is equal to T since T OR T is T. Also, (T&F) is equal to F, since T AND F is F (both should be true for the statement to be true). 

So, we get:

(T&F)

Again, T AND F is F. 

So the simplified logic formula is F.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, remember the following points: !T (not True) is always False. T&T (True and True) is always True. T&F (True and False) is always False. 

The above logic formula can be simplified as follows:

(((!T)|(T&T))|(T&F))  ->  ((!F)|(T)|(F)) (Substituting T as True and F as False)

This simplifies to (F|T|F), which is the same as (False or True or False). 

The result of ""or"" operation is True if at least one of the inputs is True. Therefore, the final simplified form is hence True, or T.",T,T

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
((c|F)|((c|F)&(T&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the ""(T&T)"" part. Because it's an ""and"" operation and both sides are True, its result will be True.

So the formula becomes: ((c|F)|((c|F)&T)).

Next, in the expression ""(c|F)"", logically, any literal ""or"" operation with False is the value of the literal because if one of the operands is False in the ""or"" operation, the result will depend on the value of the other operand. 

So, ""(c|F)"" simplifies to ""c"", causing the formula to simplify to ((c)|(c&T)).

The logical ""and"" operation, denoted as c&T, will only be True only when both operands are True. If c is False then the whole operation will be False regardless of what T is. So, this operation is equivalent to c. 

Therefore, the formula simplifies to (c|c) = c.",c,c

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Conjunction (AND, represented by &) is associative. Therefore, the expression can be simplified as follows: y AND y AND T (considering y|T equivalent to T).
2. Given that any value AND TRUE is equal to the original value, the expression can be simplified to: y. Therefore, ((y|(y|y))&(y|(y&T))) simply simplifies to y.",y,y

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we see T&T, which is T, since anything 'and' true is itself.
This simplifies the formula to the following: (i&T)&(i&T)&i 
Let's then simplify (i&T), which is i, because anything 'and' true is itself. 
The revised formula is: i&i&i 
Further simplification takes us to: i

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the & and | operations that involve the constants T and F:

c&c simplifies to c because any value logically ANDed with itself is itself.
T&F simplifies to F because True AND False results in False.
T|any value simplifies to T because any value logically ORed with True results in True.

So, the expression becomes:

(T&(l&F)),

Then, we simplify the & operation:

l&F simplifies to F because any value ANDed with False results in False.

Now, this leaves us with:

(T&F),

This simplifies to F because True AND False results in False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (q | F) is equivalent to q, because logical OR with False does not change the value of the operand. 

So, ((q | q) | (q | F)) simplifies to q.

The expression (q & q) refers to q itself as the logical AND of identical operands is the operand itself.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify !F. Since F stands for False, the negation of False is True. So, the expression turns into:

Then, apply T&T. The result is T. So, the expression turns into:

((T)&T)&(o|(T&T)) => (T)&(o|T)

Then, apply T&X law where X can be anything. The result is X. So, the expression turns into:
