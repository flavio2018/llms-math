Here are the intermediate results:
- F&T&T simplifies to F.
- c|T simplifies to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the OR logical operation with False and any other operand will return the operand. Therefore, including multiple F values will result in F. The expression ((F|F)|F)|F simplifies to F.

Second, the NOT logical operator will invert the value of its operand. The expression !(F) simplifies to T.

Therefore, the left side of the formula simplifies to T.

Third, the OR logical operation with True and any other operand will return True. Therefore, the expression F|(h|(w|T)) simplifies to T.

Fourth, the AND logical operation with False and any other operand will return False. Therefore, the expression T&F simplifies to F.

Therefore, the right side of the formula simplifies to F.

As a result, the whole formula simplifies to T&F which equals to F.",F,F

1. F&F = F

3. d&F = F

5. l&T = l (since any literal AND True is equal to the literal itself)

Applying this knowledge to the given statement, we get:

- (((l&T)|l)|F) according to point 1 and 2, which simplifies to

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, it's important to note, for the logical operators:
- true & false is always false
- true & true is always true
- false & any value is always false
- true | any value is always true
- false | true is always true
- false | false is always false

We process the formula in the following steps:
1. ((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))) - substitute T&F with F, and T&(F&F) with F
2. ((T&(T&(o&F)))|(k&(F|F))) - simplify o&F to F, and F|F to F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that ""F & anything"" is always F, and ""T & anything"" is always that ""anything"". Also, ""F | anything"" is always that ""anything"". 

Therefore, 
((a&F)&F) -> F,
(h&F) -> F,
(F&F) -> F,
((F|F)&T) -> F.

So the expression simplifies to:
((f|(F&F))|(f|F))
after replacing F & F to F it simplifies further to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!(!T)) 

This simplifies to True as negating a negation results in the original value and T is True.

2. (F|(F|F))

This results in False as logical OR-ing False with False will still be False.

3. (b&T)

Logical AND with True does not change the value, which is just b.

4. ((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b).

Since we've worked out (b&T) equals to b and (F|(F|F)) equals to False, this simplifies to:

((b|b)|b) which just also simplifies to b.

Finally, we end up with the expression (b&T) which as stated above simplifies to just b.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify ""F|F"" to just ""F"", and ""!T"" simplifies to ""F"". 

So, our expression becomes: 

(F|((((F)&(F))|T)|((F&T)&F))).

Then, we can simplify ""F&T"" as just ""F"", and ""F&F"" simplifies to ""F"".

The expression becomes: 

(F|(((F)|(T)|F))).

Next, we can simplify ""F|T"" to simply ""T"", so the expression then becomes:

Again, we can simplify ""T|F"" simply to ""T"", and the expression becomes:

“F|T”. 

Finally, ""F|T"" simplifies to ""T"". 

So the final simplified logic formula is T.",T,T
