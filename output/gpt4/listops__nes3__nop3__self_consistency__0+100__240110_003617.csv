So, let's replace this MIN operation in our expression:

[MIN 6 4 [MIN 7 0 0]].

There's another MIN operation we can perform here:

MIN 7 0 0 equals 0.

So, let's replace this MIN operation as well:

[MIN 6 4 0].

Finally, let's perform the last MIN operation:

MIN 6 4 0 equals 0.

MIN 9 8 5 = 5, 
MIN 4 3 1 = 1, 
SM 2 4 1 = 7,

So our expression now becomes [MAX [SM 5 1 4] 1 [MAX 1 5 7]].

Then we perform the remaining SM calculation: 
SM 5 1 4 = 0.

This leaves us with [MAX 0 1 [MAX 1 5 7]], and finally we do the MAX calculations:

[MAX 3 9 0] = 9 (because 9 is the maximum number)

Substitute these values back into the original expression. We get:

Then we evaluate the next operation:

[MAX 6 1 5] = 6 (because 6 is the maximum number)

Substitute this back into the expression. We get:

[SM 5 6 [SM 9 9 9]]

Now evaluate the sum modulo operation:

[SM 9 9 9] = 27 (which is the sum of the numbers) modulo 10 = 7

Substitute this back into the expression. We get:
