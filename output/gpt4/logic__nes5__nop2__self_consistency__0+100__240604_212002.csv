The statement T is always True and F is always False.

Also, A|A is the same as A because if A is true, it will be true and if A is false, it will remain false. Similar logic for A&A. No matter the value of A, (!F)&A will result in the value of A, since the logical AND of any value with true will return the same value. 

If we apply these to the provided expression:

(((w|w)|T)|(((w|w)&((!F)&(h&F)))&F))

First, simplify the w|w and !F:

((w|T)|(((w)&(h&F))&F))

Then, the h&F in the statement will always be False since False and any value is False:

((w|T)|((w)& False &F))

The logical and condition ""T&T"" is True (T), hence ""T|(T&T)"" simplifies to ""T|T"". 

The logical or condition ""T|T"" is True (T), so the left part of the initial statement simplifies to T.

In the right part of the initial statement, consider ""((g|F)|T)&F"".  ""g|F"" is the same as g because if g is true, the statement is true, and if g is false then the statement is false, so this part can be simplified to ""g"". 

Then, ""(g|T)&F"" is equivalent to ""T&F"" because ""g|T"" is always true. 

""True and False"" results in False (F), so the right part of the initial statement simplifies to F.

- Anything OR with False (F) is the same thing: (F | something) is something,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the logical OR operator ""|"" will yield True (T) if either or both of the operands are True (T). 

For example, (m | F) = m because it doesn't matter what the value of ""m"" is. If it is T, then OR operation results in T; if it is F, then we have (F | F) which is F. 

The same logic applies to (m | m); no matter what the value of ""m"" is, (m | m) = m. By replacing these expressions in the given formula, we get:

(((m|((m|m)|(m|F)))&T)|(((g&F)&T)&F)) = ((m|m)&T)|((g&F)&T)&F) = (m&T)|((g&F)&T&F)

Next, the logical AND operator ""&"" will yield False (F) as soon as one operand is False. For example, ""g&F"" will always yield F no matter what the value of ""g"" is. Similarly, any term ending with ""&F"" will be always equal to F. 

Applying these rules, we get:

Finally, the logical AND operator ""&"" will yield T only when both operands are True so (m&T) = m, provided the value of 'm' was T. If the value of 'm' is F, the result would be F. So the simplified logic formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's look at the expressions involving T and F.

We know that False AND anything (False AND True, False AND False) simplifies to False (F).

We also know that True AND anything (True AND True, True AND False) simplifies to that other thing (either True or False). 

We also know that anything OR True (True OR True, False OR True) simplifies to True (T). 

Finally, anything OR False (True OR False, False OR False) simplifies to that other thing (either True or False).

Thus, considering the expression ""(F&(T&T))"", it simplifies to F, because False AND anything is always False.

Similarly, considering the expression ""((c|T)&T)|F"", it simplifies to T, because c OR True is always True.

So, the simplified expression becomes ((l|F)|l)&(l&T), which simplify further to l&l, and that results in l.

3) FALSE & FALSE = FALSE;

((((g)|g&T))&(g|F))&(T|F))

Simplify g&g to g:

(((g)&(g|F))&(T|F))

Next, let's replace these results back into our original expression. We get:

We can simplify this further. Anything AND True is that thing itself, because the truth doesn't change the thing's value. And anything OR False is also equivalent to the thing itself for the same reason. So:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, to simplify the logic formula, consider these rules:

Solving (F&F) results in False and hence the formula becomes:
(r|(F&((T&F)&F)))

3. Again (T&F) results in False and hence the formula simplifies to:
(r|(F&(F&F)))
Which simplifies to:
(r|(F&F))
Further to:
(r|F)

4. In logic, any value OR False is always the value itself. Therefore, (r|F) simplifies to r.

So, the simplified logic formula is r.",r,r

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (((F|F)|F)|F) simplifies to F, because F OR F equals F always.

So, replacing it in the expression we get ((!(F))&((F|(h|(w|T)))&F)), which simplifies to ((T)&((F|(h|(w|T)))&F)) because NOT F equals T. 

The expression (h|(w|T)) simplifies to T because anything OR T equals T always. 

Replacing it, we get ((T)&((F|(T))&F)), which simplifies to ((T)&(T&F)), because F OR T equals T always.

Now, T & F is equal to F, because T AND F equals F always.

So, the final simplified logic formula is (T)&F which simplifies further to F.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Solve the inside brackets first:
   * (T&F) equals to F, because the and operation ""T&F"" implies both sides have to be true to yield true.
   * (F|F) equals to F, because the or operation ""F|F"" implies at least one side has to be true to yield true.
   * (T&F) equals to F for the same reason mentioned above. 
   * (T&T) equals to T, because the and operation ""T&T"" implies both sides have to be true to yield true.
  
2. Substitute the values back into the formula:

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify (F&F) as F, Also d&F as F because anything AND with False gives False. So the formula becomes:
(((l&(T|F))|l)|(F&(!F))).

Next, T|F can be simplified to T because anything OR with True gives True. And F&(!F) simplifies to F. So, the formula becomes:
(((l&T)|l)|F).

l&T is just l, because anything AND with True is itself. So, the formula now becomes:
((l|l)|F).

Finally, l|l is just l, and l|F is just l (anything OR with False is itself). So, the formula is simplified to:

l.",l,l

((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Start from inner-most expressions. T&F evaluates to F. Because and operation gives a true result if both operands are true. 

So, this simplifies the formula to ((T&(T&(o&F)))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))).

2. In the expression T&(F&F), F&F gives F. Because and operation gives a true result if both operands are true. 

Again, applying and operation on T&F gives F. Therefore, the expression can be simplified as ((T&(T&(o&F)))|(k&(F|F))).

3. F|F returns F, as the or operation results in true only if at least one operand is true. 

This simplifies the formula further to ((T&(T&(o&F)))|(k&F)).

4. T&(o&F) gives F because o&F is F (explained earlier) and applying and operation on T&F gives F. 

So, the formula now looks like this: ((T&F)|(k&F)).

5. Now, applying and operation on T&F and k&F, both expressions will be F because and operation gives a true result if both operands are true.

6. Hence, it will simplify to (F|F).

7. The or operation on F|F returns F, as or operation results in true only if at least one operand is true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Looking at the second part of the formula: (F|(h&F)). F or (h&F) - this will always be False no matter what h is since h&F = False.
2. Thus, whole expression (F|(h&F))&T itself will be False too. So, the formula can be simplified to: (f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|f.
3. Next, looking inside of the first parenthesis: ((a&F)&F). Since a&F is False, the whole expression will also be False.
4. Thus, now we have (f|F)|f, or more simply: f|f.

(((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b)&(!(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the expression from the inner operations:
T (true) & 'b' is same as 'b' which means ""b and True"" expression will be true if b is true and false otherwise.
F(which means false) | F | F is same as F, which means ""false or false or false"" expression will always be false.

Thus the whole expression becomes ((b|b)|F|b) & (!(!T)).

Simplify again. b|b is same as b. Therefore, expression becomes (b|F|b) & (!(!T)).
'b' or 'F' or 'b' is b, because ""b or False"" is b and applying 'b' or 'b' is 'b'

Expression becomes b & (!(!T)), now simplify the expression (!(!T)), is equivalent 'T' or true because logical not negates the orignal value.

So, the expression becomes 'b' & T which is equivalent to 'b'.

Thus, the original expression (((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b)&(!(!T))) simplifies down to 'b'.",b,b

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify (!T), F|F and F|T. These expressions reduce to F, F and T respectively.

So, the given expression becomes: (F|F)|((F&T)|T)|((T&F))
