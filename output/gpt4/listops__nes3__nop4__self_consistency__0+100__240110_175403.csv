Replace SM 8 6 2 4 with 0, and our expression becomes:

[MIN 9 3 8 6] = min(9, 3, 8, 6) = 3

[SM 7 2 5 9] = (7 + 2 + 5 + 9) modulo 10 = 23 modulo 10 = 3

[MAX 4 1 1 9] = max(4, 1, 1, 9) = 9

[MAX 2 3 7 3] = max(2, 3, 7, 3) = 7

[Max 3 5 6 7] returns the maximum value which is 7.
[SM 0 8 0 7] returns the sum modulo 10 of these numbers. So, (0+8+0+7) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5. 
[SM 9 3 8 8] gives (9+3+8+8) mod 10 = 28 mod 10 = 8.

SM 0 0 3 3 = (0+0+3+3) mod 10 = 6 mod 10 = 6.

MAX 4 0 7 6 = max(4,0,7,6) = 7.

MAX 7 5 1 3 = max(7,5,1,3) = 7.

After this step the inner bracket becomes:

MIN [2] 5 8 [7] which is MIN 2 5 8 7 = min(2,5,8,7) = 2.

So after the second step, the original expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's deal with the SM operations. SM 5 6 5 7 equals 23. Since we get the sum modulo 10, this operation gives us 3. The same procedure applies for SM 8 4 3 0 and SM 5 1 0 6 and SM 3 4 6 7, which give us 5, 2, and 0, respectively.

To simplify things, we can replace the SM operations in the initial expression with these results: [SM 4 [MAX 3 5 9 3] [MAX 9 2 0 8] 5].

Now, let's focus on the MAX operations. The numbers in the first MAX operation are 3, 5, 9, and 3. The maximum number here is 9. The numbers in the second MAX operation are 9, 2, 0, and 8. The maximum number here is also 9. 

Replace the MAX operations in the expression: [SM 4 9 9 5].

- [SM 6 8 4 3] = (6 + 8 + 4 + 3) mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1

So the original expression can be simplified to:

Compute the second round expressions:

SM 2 2 6 6 means to sum 2, 2, 6, and 6 then take the result modulo 10. The sum of these digits is 16, and 16 modulo 10 is 6.

Replace this calculated value back into the expression:

MAX 6 4 3 9 returns 9.

Replace these calculated values back into the expression:

[SM 4 9 8 [SM 1 0 9 2]].

Let's compute again:

1. For [SM 1 0 9 2], SM operator means the sum modulo 10. So, SM 1 0 9 2 = (1+0+9+2) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2.

Finally our expression is:

[SM 4 9 8 2].

Compute again:

1. For [SM 4 9 8 2], SM operator means the sum modulo 10. So, SM 4 9 8 2 = (4+9+8+2) mod 10 = 23 mod 10 = 3.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the innermost brackets:
[SM 5 3 8 8] = (5 + 3 + 8 + 8) mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4
[SM 5 7 8 2] = (5 + 7 + 8 + 2) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2
[MAX 5 8 0 0] = maximum of {5, 8, 0, 0} = 8

This results in the expression:
[MIN 1 [MAX 3 4 4 [MIN 2 6 2 9]] [MIN 2 3 5 8] 1].

Now, solve next level of brackets:
[MAX 3 4 4 [MIN 2 6 2 9]] = maximum of {3, 4, 4, minimum of {2, 6, 2, 9}} = maximum of {3, 4, 4, 2} = 4
[MIN 2 3 5 8] = minimum of {2, 3, 5, 8} = 2

We now have:
[MIN 1 4 2 1]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we solve the expressions inside the inner most brackets.

- [MIN 7 9 2 7] produces the minimum of the list [7, 9, 2, 7], which is 2.
- [MAX 3 0 9 4] produces the maximum of the list [3, 0, 9, 4], which is 9.
- [MAX 1 3 1 2] produces the maximum of the list [1, 3, 1, 2], which is 3.
- [MIN 8 9 0 1] produces the minimum of the list [8, 9, 0, 1], which is 0.

So the expression becomes:
[MAX 2 [SM 8 2 0 9] 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

Next, we compute the SM operator. 

- [SM 8 2 0 9] produces the sum of the list [8, 2, 0, 9] taken modulo 10, which means we add up all the numbers and divide by 10, giving us the remainder. So, (8 + 2 + 0 + 9) Mod 10 = 19 Mod 10 = 9.

This gives us:
[MAX 2 9 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

Then, we compute the inner MAX operator. 

- [MAX 5 3 1 0] produces the maximum of the list [5, 3, 1, 0], which is 5.

This gives us:
[MAX 2 9 1 5].

Finally, we solve the outermost MAX operator. 

- [MAX 2 9 1 5] produces the maximum of the list [2, 9, 1, 5], which is 9.

[SM 4 [MAX 9 2 5 9] 6 [MAX 3 0 7 5]] becomes [SM 4 9 6 7] because MAX operator takes the highest number from the list.
[MIN [MAX 7 9 9 9] 7 [MAX 5 6 1 5] 1] becomes [MIN 9 7 6 1] because MAX operator takes the highest number from the list and the list inside MIN operator now contains single-digit integer numbers.

Next, we can continue solving the expressions:
[SM 4 9 6 7] becomes 6 because we sum all the numbers and we take the last digit (26 modulo 10 equals 6).
[MIN 9 7 6 1] becomes 1 because MIN operator picks the smallest number from the list.

[SM 6 4 1 1] becomes 2 because we sum all the numbers and we take the last digit (12 modulo 10 equals 2). So, the answer is 2.",2,2

[SM 6 5 3 7] = (6 + 5 + 3 + 7) mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1
