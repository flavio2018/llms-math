2. We also recognize that `(p&(p|p))` is equal to `p`.

3. Moving on, `(b&T)&F` returns `F`, since anything and'ed with `False` returns `False`. Hence, `(p|((b&T)&F)))` returns `p`, because anything or'ed with `False` remains the same.

- ""T & F"" is False because both values must be True for an AND operation to be True.
- ""o | T"" is True because at least one value must be True for an OR operation to be True.

- ""F | F"" is equivalent to ""F"" because anything ORed with False is False.

((!T)|(F|T)) as (F|True) which gives True. 

2. So now we have (!((T&((True)&(T&T)))|(T|(!T)))). Since (T&T) will be True and also (T|(!T)) is True, it can be simplified as:
(!((T&(True&True))|True))) which further simplifies to (!((T&True)|True)) and then to (!((T)|True)).

3. Then because anything '|' (or-operations) with True is True, it simplifies to !True, which is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first step would be simplifying according to logical constants and identities. 

1. ((x|T)|F) simplifies to T because anything OR True is always True. 
   
2. (T&(T&F)) simplifies to F because True AND False equals False.

3. (!(!F|T)) simplifies to F because the inner not operation makes False into True. The OR operation between True and True gives True and its outer not operation gives False.

Since T AND T is always T, then we can replace wherever it is T AND T.

The formula then becomes : 

t & T & T & t | F

Replacing the true values, this becomes:

(((a|(((a&T)&T)&T))&(T&(!(F|(T|F)))))|(!T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First thing to notice is that logical or (|) with False or logical and (&) with True doesn't change the other operand. That is, X & T = X and X | F = X.

Another thing is that logical not (!) changes T to F and F to T. So, !T = F and !F = T. 

Finally, anything logical and (&) with False or logical or (|) with True always results in False or True receptively. for example, X & F = F and X | T = T.

Applying these rules, we get:

Step 1: T | F = T and F | T = T

So the formula becomes: (((a|(((a&T)&T)&T))&(T&(!(F|T))))|(!T))

Step 2: a&T = a (since a is either True or False, the result here doesn't change a)

This makes the formula: (((a|(a&T))&(T&(!T)))|F)

Step 3: Now we simplify !(F | T) = !(F | T) = !T = F (using the rules described above)

The formula becomes: (((a|a)&(T&F))|F)

Step 4: a | a equals a and T & F equals F

So the formula now is ((a&F)|F)

Step 5: Anything logical and (&) with False results in False

So, a&F = F

Making the formula as (F|F)

Step 6: F | F equals F

Hence, the simplified form of the formula is F.",F,F

Applying these simplifications, the given logic can be simplified as:
((F|(f|T)|F))&(!(T&True))

The logical or (|) operation returns True whenever at least one of the operands is True. Thus, F|True|F becomes True.

Therefore our logic formula becomes (True)&(!(True)), which is simply equal to (True)&(False).

(h & h) = h

- r&T will always be equal to r because True and any value is always that value.
- r|F will always be equal to r because False or any value is always that value.

- !T is False because not True is False and T|F is True because True or False is always True, so (!T)|T is True.
- But r&True is r because True and any value is always that value.
- And finally, ((r&r)&r) is also redundant and can be simplified to r.

2. The expressions ""(T|T)"" denotes the logical or between True or True, which is True. Replace this as well gives:
   !(n|(n&((T)&(T|T))))|(!(v&(!T))) = !(n|(n&((T)&(T))))|(!(v&(!T))).

3. Therefore, we have ""(n&((T)&(T))""  = ""n"". This leads us to:
   !(n|(n&((T)&(T))))|(!(v&(!T))) = !(n|n)|(!(v&(!T))).

4. Simplifying ""(n|n)"" to ""n"" - because it's the logical or between the same variable, we have:
   !(n|n)|(!(v&(!T))) = !n|(!(v&(!T))).

5. The expression ""!T"" denotes the negation of True, which is False. Replace this in the expression gives:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F&T is always False, since False and anything results in False. Similarly, s&F is also False.

    Therefore, the simplified formula becomes:

    !((i&((i|False)&(i|False)))|((F|T)&T)).

2. (i|False) will always be i, since syntactically, anything OR False equals itself. 

   So, the formula simplifies further into:

    !((i&(i&i))|(F|T)&T).

3. As per idempotent laws, i&i is simply i .

    Formulating the above input, results into:

    !((i&i)|((F|T)&T)).

4. For (F|T), according to how logical OR operation works, if even one of the inputs is True, the entire statement becomes True. 

   Substituting this will give us:

    !((i&i)|T&T)).

5. Since T&T, it is always True. Therefore, the equation simplifies into:

    !(i|True).

6. Again according to OR operation rules, if any of the terms in an OR operation is True, the entire statement becomes True. 

   So, the equation further simplifies into:

3. Now we have ((e&(T|F)). 

4. (T|F) = T, as logical or operator is true if at least one operand is true. So now our expression simplifies to e&T.

5. Any expression and with T remains as the expression itself. Therefore, ""e&T"" simplifies to ""e"".

We have done half of the expression, now let’s do the right half of the expression:

6. Three negation operations on F, so (!(!(!F))) is simply F

7. Consequently, ((F&F)|F) = (F|F) = F.

Therefore, the original expression simplifies to e&F.

- An AND operation where one of the literals is 'False' results in a 'False'. 
- An AND operation where both of the literals are 'True' results in a 'True'. 

Keeping these in mind, now start simplifying.

- The sub expressions '(F|F)', '((F|F)&F)' and '((y|F)&F)' all result to 'False' as they all have at least one 'False'. 
- '(T|T)' simply is 'True' as at least one 'True' is there.
- Similarly, the whole expression '(((F|F)&F)&((y|F)&F))' within the first bracket becomes 'False' as a result of having AND operation associated with all 'False'.
- So the whole expression till here becomes '((F & True )|((!T)&T))' which translates to '((F|((!T)&T)))'
- The sub expression '(!T)&T' results in 'False' because we are doing AND operation between a 'Not True' and 'True' which is 'False' and 'True'. 
- The expression is now '(F|False)' which is 'False' as OR operation between 'False' and 'False' is 'False'.

Also, (F|F) is False, because either of the values is False.

So, your equation turns, ((False)&(T&((s&F)|(!((j&T)|T))))). 

Any logical operator compared with False returns False, so (s&F) also becomes false.

The equation now is: ((False)&(T&(False|(!((j&T)|T))))).

Now, logical or operator with False gives the other operand as the result. So, (False|(!((j&T)|T))) is !((j&T)|T).

The current state is ((False)&(T&!((j&T)|T))).

In this, evaluating the everything in parentheses takes precedence. Now, let's simplify (!((j&T)|T)).

(j&T) is either True or False. But, (!!T) simplifies to T because double negation is cancellation.

However, anything OR-ed with True is always True. So, (!((j&T)|T)) simplifies to !(True) which is False.

The Final formula is ((False)&(T&False)). In this case,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical and operation ""&"" gives True only when both operands are True, otherwise it gives False. The logical or operation ""|"" gives True if at least one of its operands is True, otherwise it gives False. The logical not operation ""!"" flips the value of the operand, transforming True into False and vice versa. There are no not operations in your formula, so we don't need to worry about those.

Step 1: Simplify (T&T) to T because T & T = T.
Step 2: Simplify (T&F) to F because T & F = F.
Step 3: Simplify (r&r) to r because r & r = r.
Step 4: Simplify (F|F) to F because F | F = F.
Step 5: Simplify (r&T) to r because r & T = r.

Using these new values, the formula now reads: (r&T)&((r|F)|(F|r))

Step 6: Simplify (r|F) to r because r | F = r.
Step 7: Simplify (F|r) to r because F | r = r.

The formula now reads: (r&T)&(r|r)

3. T & True is always True. Here True is replaced by simplified !(p & F).

4. F & T gives us False, because F (False) when AND operated with any expression gives us False.

5. F | F is False, because False OR False will give us False.

6. x & (F | F) is x & False. For any expression or variable, the AND operation with False will yield False. 

7. (True | F) | F becomes True OR False, which gives us True because True OR anything will give us True.

3. T or T is always T in logical ""or"", so we can simplify it to T.

The formula becomes: (!((y&T)|T))|(!T).

4. y & T = y in case y is the truth variable because it can be either true or false - if y is true, the whole expression is true; if y is false, the whole expression is false.

So we have: (!((y|T))|!T).
