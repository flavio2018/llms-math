A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify the logical and (denoted by &) connections:
- Anytime we see False (F) & Something (it doesn't matter what this something is), the result of this operation is False. This is because for logical and to be True, both values have to be True. If even one of them is False, the result is False. 

This simplification gives us:
- (F&F) = F
- (F&T) = F (even though we have True here, the other operand is False which makes the entire operation False)
- (F&(!F)) = F (this one seems tricky, because we have logical not - denoted by ! - in front of F, but keep in mind the rule we identified at the beginning. Since F, which is False, is one of the operands, the entire operation becomes False)

Now let's plug these simplified operations back into our expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, anything AND itself is equal to itself, so n&n is simply n, and s&s is simply s. Furthermore, anything AND False is equal to False, as for a statement to be AND 'True', all parts must be True.

With this, we can simplify the formula:
(((n&n)&n)|((s&s)&F)) -> (n&n|s&F) -> (n|False) -> n

So the simplified formula is 'n'.",n,n

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First: 

(!F) is True and (F|T) is True, because anything OR True is always True.

So the expression so far is (True|True)&(T&F).

Second: 

(True|True) is True, because anything OR True is always True.

(T&F) is False because True AND False results in False.

So the final expression is True&False.

False is the equivalent of False AND anything.

So, the simplified formula is F.",F,F

(((!T)|(T&T))|(T&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula is: (((!T)|(T&T))|(T&F)).

Step 1: Simplify (!T). The logical not of True (!T) is False.
So, the formula is now: ((F|(T&T))|(T&F)).

Step 2: Simplify (T&T). The logical and of True and True (T&T) is True.
So, the formula is now: ((F|T)|(T&F)).

Step 3: Simplify (F|T). The logical or of False and True (F|T) is True.
So, the formula is now: (T|(T&F)).

Step 4: Simplify (T&F). The logical and of True and False (T&F) is False.
So, the formula is now: (T|F).

Step 5: Simplify (T|F). The logical or of True and False (T|F) is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify T&T. Since both the values are true, the result is true or 'T'. 

The expression becomes:
((c|F)|((c|F)&T))

Then, simplify (c|F)&T. Since F or 'false' does not affect the or operation and T does not affect an and operation, it simplifies to 'c'. 

The expression then becomes:

Lastly, c|c simplifies to 'c' because a value OR'd with itself will always return that value. So, the simplified logic formula is just 'c'.",c,c

(i&i&i)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the conjunction (AND) is always False if at least one of the operands is False. So, T&F simplifies to F.

Then, you have l&F which simplifies to F, because anything AND False is False.

Afterwards, you have ((c&c)|T)&F. Here, (c&c) just simplifies to c, so this becomes (c|T)&F.

The disjunction (OR) is always True if at least one of the operands is True. So, c|T simplifies to T.
