A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the operator expressions from inner to outer:

1. The MAX is maximum function, which means it takes the largest number from the list. So, [MAX 9 4 0] = 9, [MAX 3 8 4] = 8, [MAX 9 5 0] = 9. 

2. The SM is sum modulo 10 function, which means it adds all the number and then applies modulo 10 to the result. So, [SM 0 4 2] = (0+4+2) mod 10 = 6, [SM 8 0 3] = (8+0+3) mod 10 = 1, [SM 7 4 8] = (7+4+8) mod 10 = 9. [SM 1 7 8] = (1+7+8) mod 10 = 6, [SM 1 6 4] = (1+6+4) mod 10 = 1.

Now, we will replace these in the original equation:

Next step is to resolve the inner brackets again:

[SM 0 2 7] = 9 (because 0+2+7 = 9)
[MAX 9 6 8] = 9
[SM 1 5 8] = 4 (because 1+5+8 = 14 and 14 modulo 10 = 4)

2. [MIN 6 4 7] - Since MIN gives the minimum of the list, so the result will be 4
3. [SM 9 0 9] - This equals to the sum of 9 + 0 + 9 = 18, but as per the SM (sum modulo 10) operator, it would be 18 mod 10 = 8
4. [MAX 9 8 5] - Since MAX gives the maximum of the list, so the result will be 9
5. [SM 7 9 3] - This equals to the sum of 7 + 9 + 3 = 19, but as per the SM (sum modulo 10) operator, it would be 19 mod 10 = 9
6. [MIN 4 3 1] - Since MIN gives the minimum of the list, so the result will be 1
7. [MIN 7 0 9] - Since MIN gives the minimum of the list, so the result will be 0
8. [MIN 0 2 5] - Since MIN gives the minimum of the list, so the result will be 0

After this step, the expression to be solved would look like:

Next set of simplifications will be:

1. [MIN 3 9 4] - The minimum out of 3, 9 and 4 is 3
2. [SM 7 8 9] - Sum of 7, 8 and 9 is 24, which under the modulo 10 operator becomes 24 mod 10 = 4
3. [SM 9 6 1] - Sum of 9, 6 and 1 is 16, which under the modulo 10 operator becomes 16 mod 10 = 6
4. [MIN 0 0 8] - The minimum out of 0, 0 and 8 is 0

This simplifies the expression further to:

[MAX 7 [MAX 3 1 4] [SM 6 2 0]]

Lastly, simplify to:

1. [MAX 3 1 4] - The maximum out of 3, 1 and 4 is 4
2. [SM 6 2 0] - Sum of 6, 2 and 0 is 8, which under the modulo 10 operator becomes 8 mod 10 = 8

- [MAX 0 2 1] will give the maximum, which is 2.
- [MIN 6 8 0] will give the minimum, which is 0.
- [SM 0 3 5] will give 0 + 3 + 5 = 8.

   - MAX 5 5 6 = 6
   - MAX [SM 9 5 7] [MAX 2 5 8] 0:
     - SM 9 5 7 = (9 + 5 + 7) % 10 = 21 % 10 = 1
     - MAX 2 5 8 = 8
   - So, MAX 1 8 0 = 8.
   - MAX 8 [MIN 5 6 9] [MAX 5 4 8]:
     - MIN 5 6 9 = 5
     - MAX 5 4 8 = 8
   - So, MAX 8 5 8 = 8.

     - MIN 9 1 8 = 1
     - SM 7 6 1 = (7 + 6 + 1) % 10 = 14 % 10 = 4

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we look into inner parts of outer MIN and MAX operators:
[MIN 6 1 5] = 1, as 1 is the smallest digit.
[MAX 8 6 6] = 8, because 8 is the largest digit.
[MIN 2 7 7] = 2, as 2 is the smallest digit.
[SM 6 2 8] = 6, as sum of these digits gives 16, and modulo 10 of 16 is 6.
[MAX 5 4 9] = 9, because 9 is the largest digit.
[MIN 3 4 4] = 3, because 3 is the smallest digit.

Substituting these results, the expression becomes:
[SM 2 [MIN 4 [SM 1 4 [SM 1 6 7]] [SM [SM 3 6 4] 6 3]] [MAX [SM 2 8 8] [MIN 6 0 9] 9]]. 

Continuing with the inner parts:
[SM 1 6 7] = 4, as sum of these digits is 14 (14 modulo 10 gives 4).
[SM 3 6 4] = 3, as sum of these digits is 13, and modulo 10 of 13 is 3.
[MIN 4 [SM 1 4 4]] = 4, because sum of inner elements is 9, but 4 is less than 9.
[SM 2 8 8] = 8, as sum of numbers is 18 (18 modulo 10 gives 8).
[MIN 6 0 9] = 0, because 0 is less than 6 and 9.

Let's substitute these results as well:
[SM 2 4 [SM 3 6 3]] [MAX 8 0 9].

Continuing calculations we get:
[SM 3 6 3] = 2, obtaining 12 (12 modulo 10 gives 2).
[MAX 8 0 9] = 9, because 9 is the largest digit.

Substitute these:

Finally, calculate:
[SM 2 4 2] = 8, as the sum of those numbers is 18 (18 modulo 10 gives 8).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve sub-expressions one by one, starting from the inner-most expressions:

In the first square brackets we have:
- [MAX 0 9 4] This operation chooses maximum number from the list which is 9.
- [SM 4 9 1] Here we add all numbers and modulo 10 so it becomes (4+9+1)%10 = 14%10 = 4.
- The above expressions become: [SM [9] [4] 2] which gives (9+4+2)%10 = 15%10 = 5.

In the second square brackets we have:
- [MAX 0 4 3] This operation chooses maximum number from the list which is 4.
- [SM 2 7 5] Here we add all numbers and modulo 10 so it becomes (2+7+5)%10 = 14%10 = 4.
- [MAX [4] 5 [4]] gives us the maximum number which is 5.
- Thus it becomes: [SM [5] [5] 2] which gives (5+5+2)%10 = 12%10 = 2.

In the third square brackets we have:
- [SM 5 5 2] Here we add all numbers and modulo 10 so it becomes (5+5+2)%10 = 12%10 = 2.
- [MIN 0 [2] [8]] operation chooses minimum number from the list which is 0.
- Similarly, [MIN 7 1 0] operation chooses minimum number from the list which is 0.
- [SM 9 2 4] Here we add all numbers and modulo 10 so it becomes (9+2+4)%10 = 15%10 = 5.
- [MIN 2 [0] [5]] operation chooses minimum number which is 0.
- Thus it becomes: [MIN [0] 3 [0]] which gives us 0.

Now, we have final expression to be solved:
[SM [5] [2] 2] [0] 2.

Here [SM [5] [2] 2] gives us (5+2+2)%10 = 9%10 = 9,

    MAX 1 7 7 = 7
    MAX 0 3 0 = 3
    MAX 5 2 4 = 5

[SM [MAX 4 7 8] [MAX 3 5 6]]

Continue solving the MAX operations:

    MAX 4 7 8 = 8
    MAX 3 5 6 = 6

Then the expression becomes: [SM 8 6]

7. [SM 0 5 5] = 0 (since 0 + 5 + 5 = 10, but the sum is modulo 10)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, MAX 5 2 5 will return 5, and SM 7 7 7 will give 21 modulo 10, that is 1. MIN 2 2 6 gives 2. So, the first SM becomes: 
SM 9 [SM 4 [SM 5 3 [SM 8 8 2]] [MAX 5 1 2]], but it is easy to see that [MAX 5 1 2] will yield 5.

Next, MIN 3 [MAX 2 7 8] [MIN 3 1 9] results in MIN 3 8 1, so it's 1. MIN 3 9 3 returns 3, and SM 1 9 8 gives 18 mod 10, that's 8. So, the next part is [SM [1] [SM [3] 1 [8]] 5].

Now we can compute those deeper nested SM operators. SM 8 8 2 yields 18 mod 10 = 8, SM 4 [SM 5 3 8] produces SM 4 [16 mod 10] = SM 4 6 = 10 mod 10 = 0, SM [3] 1 [8] gives SM [3] 1 8 = 12 mod 10 = 2. Therefore, we have got [SM 9 0 5] [SM [1] 2 5] = 9 7 and 8:.

MAX 7 9 5 = 9 (since 9 is the maximum number from 7, 9 and 5)

MAX [MAX 6 3 2] 4 = 6 (since 6 is the maximum number from 6,3 and 2 and that is more than 4)

MIN 4 6 5 = 4 (since 4 is the minimum number from 4,6,5)

MIN 1 4 3 = 1 (since 1 is the minimum number from 1,4,3)

Then substitute these values back into the original expression:

SM 0 [MIN 7 8 [MAX 5 9 1]] [MAX 6 [MAX 4 2] [MAX 4 1 7]]

Then simplify further:

MIN 7 8 = 7 (since 7 is less than 8)

MAX 5 9 1 = 9 (since 9 is the maximum of 5, 9 and 1)

MAX 4 2 = 4 (since 4 is the maximum of 4 and 2)

MAX 4 1 7 = 7 (since 7 is the maximum of 4, 1 and 7)

Subsitute these values into the expression:

SM 2 5 8 = (2+5+8) mod 10 = 5
SM 2 8 4 = (2+8+4) mod 10 = 4

Next, we calculate the nested SM functions. The SM function sums all of its arguments modulo 10. Modulo 10 simply means the remainder of that number when divided by 10.

- SM 5 0 7 = (5 + 0 + 7) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2
- SM 8 4 9 = (8 + 4 + 9) mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1 
- SM [1] [2] 6 = (1 + 2 + 6) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9
- SM [0] [1] 0 = (0 + 1 + 0) mod 10 = 1 mod 10 = 1

Now we are left with the following: 

[MIN 2 [SM [MIN [9] [6] 3] [SM [0] [8] 7] 3] [SM 4 [9] [1]]].

Solving the remaining SM and MIN functions:

- MIN [9] [6] = minimum of 9 and 6 = 6
- SM [6] 3 = (6 + 3) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9
- SM [0] [8] 7 = (0 + 8 + 7) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5
- SM 4 [9] [1] = (4 + 9 + 1) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4

After performing these operations, our expression reduces to:

Next,

Here,
[MAX 1 5 8] gives maximum of 1, 5, and 8 which equals 8.
[MIN 4 7 2] gives minimum of 4, 7 and 2 which equals 2.
So we get [MIN 8 4 2] which results in the minimum of 8, 4, and 2 which equals 2. 

So the first part is [SM 3 9 2] which results in (3 + 9 + 2) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4.

Now we move to the second part:

[MAX 9 0 5] gives maximum of 9, 0 and 5 which equals 9.
[SM 8 9 9] gives sum of 8, 9 and 9 modulo 10 which equals 6.

MIN 6 5 gives 5. So the inner part of the first Min value is 1.

MIN 2 1 5 gives 1 and SM 1 9 [SM 0 6 4] gives 10 and after taking modulo 10, we get 0. On the other side, MIN 2 5 5 gives 2 and MAX 4 5 9 gives 9, so MIN 2 9 7 gives 2. Therefore, MAX 0 2 3 gives 3.

[MIN 7 1 5] becomes 1 because MIN 7 1 5 is 1.

So, [MAX [MIN 7 1 5] 2 [MIN 4 1 2]] becomes [MAX 1 2 1], which results in 2 because MAX 1 2 1 is 2.

[MIN 8 8 6] becomes 6 because MIN 8 8 6 is 6.

[SM 6 6 4] becomes 6 because SM 6 6 4 is ((6+6+4) mod 10) = 6.

So, [MIN [MIN 8 8 6] [SM 6 6 4] 8] becomes [MIN 6 6 8], which results in 6 because MIN 6 6 8 is 6.

[MIN 5 6 9] becomes 5 because MIN 5 6 9 is 5.

[MAX 0 4 1] becomes 4 because MAX 0 4 1 is 4.

So, [MIN [MIN 5 6 9] 5 [MAX 0 4 1]] becomes [MIN 5 5 4], which results in 4 because MIN 5 5 4 is 4.

The equation becomes:
[MIN [SM 3 9 8] 2 6] [MIN 6 4 7].

Then calculate the SM operator:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's consider the nested expressions inside the brackets:
- MAX [SM 2 3 3]: SM (sum modulo 10) is 2+3+3 module 10 = 8 (since any number ""modulo 10"" is simply the remainder after dividing by 10). So, we have MAX 8.
- SM 9 8 1: SM is 9+8+1 module 10 = 18 module 10 = 8. 
- MAX 9 0 3: MAX (maximum) is 9 because it is the biggest number here.
- SM 8 2 5: SM is 8+2+5 module 10 = 15 module 10 = 5. 
- MAX 4 [SM 7 1 6] [MAX 3 5 1]: Here we have two nested operations. First, SM 7 1 6 is 7+1+6 module 10 = 14 module 10 = 4. Then, MAX 3 5 1 is 5 as it is the largest number here. Now we have MAX 4 4 5 which is 5.
- MIN 3 4 0: MIN (minimum) is 0 because it is the smallest number here.
- MIN 7 4 8: MIN is 4 because it is the smallest number here.
- SM [MIN 3 4 0] [MIN 7 4 8] 6: After resolving a few nested operations now we have SM 0 4 6, which is 0+4+6 module 10 = 10 module 10 = 0. So, we have SM 0.
Now, let's insert these results back to the main expression:
- SM 1 [MAX [SM 2 3 3] [SM 9 8 1] 5] is SM 1 [MAX 8 8 5] which is SM 1 8 and is 1+8 module 10 = 9.
- MIN [MAX 9 0 3] [SM 8 2 5] 2 is MIN 9 5 2, which is 2.
- MAX 4 [SM 7 1 6] [MAX 3 5 1] is replaced with the value obtained before - 5.
- SM [MIN 3 4 0] [MIN 7 4 8] 6 is replaced with the value obtained before - 0.
So, the new expression is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the innermost operations:

SM 6 9 7 = (6+9+7) mod 10 = 2

Now substitute these results back into the initial expression:
[MAX [MAX 5 [MAX 9 7 8]] [SM 2 [MAX 6 5 5] 5] 0 [SM [SM 8 1 8] 2 [SM 2 4 2]]]

Continue with the next operations:

SM 8 1 8 = (8+1+8) mod 10 = 7
SM 2 4 2 = (2+4+2) mod 10 = 8

Substitute these results back into the initial expression:
[MAX 9 8 0 [SM 7 2 8]]

Finally calculate the remaining operations: 
SM 7 2 8 = (7+2+8) mod 10 = 7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to resolve the SM operations as they involve a simple summation of the numbers and then taking modulo 10. This mapping is:

- [SM 1 0 8] = (1 + 0 + 8) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9

- [SM 4 9 2] = (4 + 9 + 2) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5

Next, we simplify the innermost MIN and MAX operations:

- [MIN 5 9 9] = MIN of 5, 9, and 9 = 5
- [MAX 1 1 0] = MAX of 1, 1, and 0 = 1
- [MIN 4 2 8] = MIN of 4, 2, and 8 = 2
- [MAX 6 2 7] = MAX of 6, 2, and 7 = 7

We then replace the original expressions with these results and update complex expressions:

- [MIN 1 2 5] = MIN of 1, 2, and 5 = 1
- [MIN 4 5 7] = MIN of 4, 5, and 7 = 4
