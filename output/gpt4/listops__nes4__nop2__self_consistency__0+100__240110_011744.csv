Here,
SM 8 2 would be 10, but since it is modulo 10, it would become 0.
MAX 9 6 would be 9,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the SM operations:
- SM 9 8 gives 17. However, since this is a sum modulo 10 operation, the result would just be the last digit, so the result of SM 9 8 is 7.
- SM 7 6 gives 13. Similar to earlier, since this is a sum modulo 10, the result would just be the last digit, so the result of SM 7 6 is 3.
- SM 3 8 gives 11. Again, because it's modulo 10, the final result is 1.
- There are two nested operations for SM - SM [MAX 2 1] and SM 0 9. The MAX 2 1 gives 2 as a result and then SM 2 and SM 0 9 both give 2 and 9 as a result respectively.

Now, replace the calculated results back into the expression and solve the nested MAX and MIN functions:
- MAX [SM 9 8] [SM 7 6] becomes MAX 7 3, which results in 7.
- MIN [MAX 6 1] [SM 3 8] becomes MIN 6 1, which results in 1.
- Next, process the expression MIN [MAX 7 1] to get 1.
- Coming down to the next nested operation, MAX [MIN 7 1] gives 7.
- On the next expression, MAX 2 1 gives 2 and SM [MAX 2 1] results in 2.
- MIN 8 5 gives us 5 and therefore SM [MAX 2 1] [MIN 8 5] becomes SM 2 5, which is 7 modulo 10.
- MIN [SM [MAX 2 1] [MIN 8 5]] becomes MIN 7, and similarly MIN [SM 0 9] [MAX 2 3] becomes MIN 9 3 which gives 3.
- Finally, the expression MAX [MIN [MAX 7 1] [MIN 9 3]] results in MAX [1 3], which gives us 3.

- SM 2 5 gives us 7 because the sum of 2 and 5 modulo 10 is 7. 

Therefore, the first part of the expression inside the next set of brackets becomes [SM 2 7], which equals 9.

Next is:

- SM 1 5 gives us 6 because the sum of 1 and 5 modulo 10 is 6.
- MAX 4 8 gives us 8 because 8 is the maximum between 4 and 8.

Therefore, the second part of the expression inside the next set of brackets becomes [MIN 6 8], which equals 6.

- MAX 0 7 gives us 7 because 7 is the maximum between 0 and 7.
- SM 9 3 gives us 2 because the sum of 9 and 3 modulo 10 is 2.

Therefore, the first part of our second main bracket becomes [SM 7 2], which equals 9.

Next is:

- SM 4 1 gives us 5 because the sum of 4 and 1 modulo 10 is 5.
- The next operation is supposed to be [MAX 2 0], which gives us 2.

Therefore, the second part of our second main bracket becomes [SM 5 2], which equals 7.

- MAX 0 8 = 8
- MAX 6 8 = 8
- MIN 8 8 = 8 (These are results of two previous steps)

- SM 3 7 = 10, but since we go modulo 10, we use the remainder of this division by 10, which is 0.

The minimum of 1 and 7 is 1, and the maximum of 9 and 0 is 9.

Then, solve the sum modulo 10 operations:

The sum of 9 and 2 is 11. Since we are doing sum modulo 10, we only keep the last digit, so this gives us 1. 

Similarly, the sum of 6 and 6 is 12, so the result is 2. 

So now we have [SM [SM [MAX 1 1] [MAX 2 9]] [SM [MAX [MAX 1 0] [MAX 6 9]] [SM [MAX 1 8] [MAX 5 0]]]]. 

Working backwards, the maximum of 1 and 1 is 1, and the maximum of 2 and 9 is 9. 

Next, the maximum of 1 and 0 is 1, and the maximum of 6 and 9 is 9. 

Similarly, the maximum of 1 and 8 is 8, and the maximum of 5 and 0 is 5.

So now we have [SM [SM 1 9] [SM [SM 1 9] [SM 8 5]]]. 

Do sum modulo 10 operations:

The sum of 1 and 9 is 10, and modulo 10 gives us 0. 

Similarly, the sum of 1 and 9 is 10, and modulo 10 gives us 0. 

The sum of 8 and 5 is 13 and modulo 10 gives us 3.

SM 9 2 is equal to (9 + 2) mod 10, which is 1.
SM 7 5 is equal to (7 + 5) mod 10, which is 2.
SM [MIN 6 3] [MAX 6 5] is equal to SM 3 6, which is (3 + 6) mod 10, which is 9.
SM [MAX 4 4] [MIN 8 2] is equal to SM 4 2, which is (4 + 2) mod 10, which is 6.
SM [MAX 4 1] [MAX 5 6] is equal to SM 4 6, which is (4 + 6) mod 10, which is 0.

So the expression now becomes:

[MAX [SM [MIN 1 2] 9] [MIN [SM 6 [MAX 0 6]]]]

Solving MIN and MAX operations inside the SM operations we get:

MIN 1 2 is equal to 1.
MAX 0 6 is equal to 6.

So the expression now becomes:

[MAX [SM 1 9] [MIN [SM 6 6]]]

Solving the remaining SM operations we get:

SM 1 9 is equal to (1 + 9) mod 10, which is 0.
SM 6 6 is equal to (6 + 6) mod 10, which is 2.

So the expression now becomes:

[MAX 0 [MIN 2]]

Solving the MIN operation we get:

MIN 2 is equal to 2.

So the expression now becomes:

[MAX 0 2]

Solving the MAX operation we get:

MAX 0 2 is equal to 2.

So the final result is 2.",2,0

Solve the following expression involving these operators:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's calculate the innermost operations:

[MIN 6 6] = 6
[MIN 0 8] = 0
[MAX 7 6] = 7
[SM 1 1] = 2 (1+1 modulo 10)

Now the new expression is:
[MIN [SM [MAX 6 0] [MAX 7 2]] [SM [MIN [MAX 5 4] [MIN 1 1]] [SM [SM 1 2] [MIN 1 1]]]]

Let's calculate [MAX 6 0] = 6 and [MAX 5 4] = 5. Also, [MIN 1 1]= 1 and [SM 1 2] = 3 (1+2 modulo 10)

Now the new expression is:
[MIN [SM 6 [MAX 7 2]] [SM [MIN 5 1] 3]]

Calculate [MAX 7 2] = 7 and [MIN 5 1] = 1

Now the new expression is:
[MIN [SM 6 7] [SM 1 3]]

Calculate [SM 6 7] = 3 (6+7=13 modulo 10)

Now the new expression is:
[MIN 3 [SM 1 3]]

Calculate [SM 1 3] = 4 (1+3 modulo 10)

Now the new expression is:
[MIN 3 4]

And the final result is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, find the results inside the innermost brackets:

MIN [MIN 3 0] = 0
SM 1 5 = 6
MIN 3 4 = 3
MAX 6 7 = 7
MAX 1 0 = 1
MIN 4 6 = 4
MAX 5 7 = 7
SM 8 3 = 1 (because 8+3=11 and 11 modulo 10 is 1)

So, the equation becomes:

[MAX [MIN [0] [6]] [MAX [3] [7]]] [MIN [MAX [1] [4]] [MAX [7] [1]]]

Next, find the result again:

MIN 0 6 = 0
MAX 3 7 = 7
MAX 1 4 = 4
MAX 7 1 = 7

Now the expression would be:

[MAX [0] [7]] [MIN [4] [7]]

Proceed to the next step:

MAX 0 7 = 7
MIN 4 7 = 4

Finally:

MAX 7 4 = 7
