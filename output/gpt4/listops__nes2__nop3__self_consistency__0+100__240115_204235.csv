[SM [SM 9 9 4] 5 [SM 2 1 2]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, apply the SM operator to the innermost parentheses. SM takes the sum of the arguments modulo 10.

SM 9 9 4 = (9 + 9 + 4) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2
SM 2 1 2 = (2 + 1 + 2) mod 10 = 5 mod 10 = 5

Now substituting these values back into the original problem, the expression becomes:

SM [2] 5 [5]

SM operator takes the sum of the arguments modulo 10.

SM 2 5 5 = (2 + 5 + 5) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2

So, [SM [SM 9 9 4] 5 [SM 2 1 2]] = 2.",2,2

[MAX [SM 2 0 1] 4 [MAX 7 9 0]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we solve the inner bracket with the SM operator. Here SM stands for sum modulo 10. So we have to sum up 2, 0 and 1 and take modulo 10, which means we are finding the remainder of the division of this sum by 10. The sum of 2, 0, and 1 would be 3, and the remainder of the division of 3 by 10 is 3. So the result of [SM 2 0 1] is 3. 

So, substitute this value back into the expression, we get:
[MAX 3 4 [MAX 7 9 0]]

Next, we solve the next set of brackets [MAX 7 9 0]. The MAX operator gives us the maximum value in the set. So, the maximum value of 7, 9, and 0 is 9.

Replace [MAX 7 9 0] with 9, and we obtain:
[MAX 3 4 9]

Finally, we have to find the MAX of 3, 4, and 9, which is 9. So, the answer is 9.",9,9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we must compute the two innermost SM operations.

SM 1 6 3 = (1 + 6 + 3) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the operations inside the brackets. SM 7 6 1 means adding the numbers and get the modulo 10 of the sum. 7 + 6 + 1 = 14, and 14 mod 10 = 4. This makes the first bracket [SM 7 6 1] equals to 4.

Second, solve MAX 5 4 0, which means get the maximum number between these 3 numbers. This means the second bracket [MAX 5 4 0] equals to 5.

Substitute these results back into the main expression, it becomes [MAX 4 5 8]. This expression means get the maximum number between the numbers in the brackets, which is 8.
