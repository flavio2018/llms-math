A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve the innermost operations, which are the sum modulo 10 calls. 

[SM 9 9 4] = (9+9+4) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2.

[SM 2 1 2] = (2+1+2) mod 10 = 5 mod 10 = 5.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to compute the 'SM' operator for the list [2 0 1]. Summing these numbers gives us 2+0+1 = 3. As stated, the 'SM' operator is sum modulo 10. As 3 is less than 10, we simply keep it as 3. So our expression becomes:
