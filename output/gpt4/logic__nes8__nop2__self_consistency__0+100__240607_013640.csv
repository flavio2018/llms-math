Simplify ""f|F"" to ""f"" because anything OR false is always that thing itself.

((f&(f&T)))&(F|(z|T))

""f&(f&T)"" again simplifies to ""f&T"" and ""F|(z|T)"" simplifies to ""T"" because anything OR true is always true.

3. As for the statement ""T|(T&T)"", since T&T is True and True OR anything is True. Therefore ""T|(T&T)"" becomes T.

5. And any literal ""and"" with False (l&F where l could be either T or F or any literal) will be equivalent to False itself. Hence f&F simplifies to F.
6. Now we have a conjunction ""(f&T)"" which becomes F since we already establish that anything and with False becomes false. Plus, the statement ""T|F"" simplifies to T because True or anything is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the result of any disjunction (OR operation) between a variable and itself is the same variable.

This means we can simplify (b&b) to become b.

So, condensing, the above formula simplifies to:

((b&b)|T|(!T)|(F|T)).

As all AND and OR operations with itself does not change the value, (b&b) simplifies to:

(b|T|(!T)|(F|T)).

Now, substitute these values into the expression:

Now, observe that:

- a value AND False is always False,
- a value OR False is always that value.

((!((!(T|(!(!F))))&F))|(!((F|(!(((k|k)&(k&k))|T)))&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression is ((!((!(T|(!(!F))))&F))|(!((F|(!(((k|k)&(k&k))|T)))&T))). 

Firstly, !F is equivalent to T

Therefore, the expression becomes ((!((!(T|(!T)))&F))|(!((F|(!(((k|k)&(k&k))|T)))&T))). 

Thereafter, T|(!T) is equivalent to T 

Therefore, the expression becomes ((!((!T)&F))|(!((F|(!(((k|k)&(k&k))|T)))&T))). 

!T&F is equivalent to F

Therefore, the expression becomes ((!(F))|(!((F|(!(((k|k)&(k&k))|T)))&T))). 

!(F) is equivalent to T

Therefore, the expression becomes (T|(!((F|(!(((k|k)&(k&k))|T)))&T))). 

Now considering the latter part of the expression: F|(!(((k|k)&(k&k))|T)))

(k|k)&(k&k) is equivalent to k

F|(!(k|T)) 

still simplifies down to F|(!T) 

which is equivalent to F|F, 

which simplifies further to F. 

The entire expression is then (T|(!(F&T))), 

which simplifies further to T|(!F)

since !F is T, this simplifies further to T|T, 

which in the end simplifies to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The expression (F&T) is always False, because True and False together gives False. So we can replace the entire part with F. So, the expression becomes ((y|F)&(((y|((y|F)|((y|y)|((y& T)&(F| T)))))|(!(!F)))|F)).

2. For OR operation, (X|F) is always x itself. The expression (y|F) is y. Replacing it, we get (y&(((y|((y| F)|((y|y)|((y& T)&(T| F)))))|(!(!F)))|F)).

3. We also know that (X|X) is always X itself. Therefore, (y|y) is y. So the equation becomes (y&(((y|((y| F)|((y| T)&(T| F)))))|(!(!F)))|F).

4. Using the aforementioned rule of (X|F) is always x itself, (y|F) becomes y so, the expression becomes (y&(((y|(y| ((y& T)&(T| F)))))|(!(!F)))|F).

5. Additionally, we know that (F|T) is always True, because we have a True in a logical OR operation. So (T|F) can be replaced with T and the equation becomes (y&(((y|(y| (y& T)))|(!(!F)))|F)).

6. Also the expression (!(!F)) is equivalent to F, as negating a negation returns the original expression, so we can replace it, which gives us (y&(((y|(y| (y& T)))|F)|F)).

7. Furthermore, (X& T) is always X itself. Therefore, (y& T) is y. The equation becomes (y&((y| y)|F|F)).

8. Using the rule of (X|F) yields X, we replace (y| F) with y and get (y&(y| y)).

9. Again, since (X|X) is X itself, (y| y) is also y. Thus, the equation simplifies to (y& y).

10. Finally, by the rule (X& X) is X itself, (y& y) is y too.

F|(!T) is the same as F|F, which is F (False or (not True) is False or False, which is False).
T|(f|((!F)&T)) is simply T (True or anything is always True).

So, ((F|(!T))|T) simplifies to F|T, or T (False or True is True).

g|F is simply g (any value or False is just the value).

Using this, the expression simplifies to (((g&g)|g)&g)&T, which simplifies to merely g (since any value and itself is just the value, and anything and True is the identity itself).

3. So, (!T)|(T&F) will be False. Not of False is True. So, !((F&T)&((!T)|(T&F))) will be True.
4. (T|(!F)) will give you True, as one of the Boolean values is True in the logical or operation, so that makes the whole statement True. 
5. So, you have True & True, which is True.
6. Then, there will be True | True, which is obviously True.
7. Similarly, x&T will be x as you just need a True value in logical and operation, and as we know variable ‘x’ can be both True or False. So, it will be x.
8. T|(x|T) will be True.

False&T will evaluate to False, everything AND False is False. So, (False|F)&F)|(F&((!((((o&o)&(o&T))|o)|True))&F)).

Moving into the second part (!((((o&o)&(o&T))|o)|True). Here, o&o is always o. o&T is o if o is True and False if o is False. OR operation with 'o' on both sides can simply be reduced to 'o'. Therefore, (!((((o&o)&(o&T))|o)|True) becomes (!True), hence False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, simplify the parentheses that contain T or F. Since T stood for True and F for False, (!T) equals False, (F|F) equals False, (T&T) equals True, (T|(F|T)) equals True; 

2. After replacing the simplifications in parentheses, the formula becomes: 
   ((False|T)&(F&((F|((r|T)|((T&False)&True)))&(!True)))) 
   which equal to: 
   ((False or True) and (False and ((False or ((r or True) or ((True and False)and True))and (not True)))))
   
3. Then, simplify these results, (False|T) equals true, (T&False) equals False, (False or r or True) equals true and (r or T) equals true (because anything ""or"" with true equals true), (False or True) equals true, !(T&T) equals False;

4. Now the formula become: 
   ((True)&(F&((True)&(False))))
   which equals to:
   (True and (False and (True and False)))
   
5. Finally, we simplify the formula. Since anything ""and"" with False is False, we simply replace every ""and False"" with False, so that (True)&(F&((True)&(False))) becomes False. 

Therefore, we have simplified the logic formula to its simplest form: F.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, in boolean logic, anything ORed with False (X|F) is X (since False or anything else takes the value of that ‘anything else’). For example, (T|F) is T. Anything ORed with True (X|T) is always True (since True or anything is always True). For example, (l|T) is T. Also, anything ANDed with True (X&T) is X (since True and anything else takes the value of that ‘anything else’). For example, ((F|T)&T) becomes (T&T) and therefore T. On the other hand, anything ANDed with False (X&F) is False (since False and anything is always False).

Moreover, NOT True is False ( !T is F), and NOT False is True (!F is T).

Now, let's simplify the given formula:

(((i|i)|(((p&(e|((l|T)|F)))|(!(T|((F|T)&T))))&(F|F)))&(T|F))

Step 1: Substituting ORed with True and False, ANDed with True and False values and NOT True and False

= (((i|i)|(((p&(e|(T|F))|(!T|(!T))))&F))&T)

Step 2: Every value ORed with False is the value itself and every value ORed with True is True

= (((i|i)|((p&(e|T)|F)&F))&T)
= (((i|i)|((p&True|F)&F))&T)
= (((i|i)|((p|F)&F))&T)

((v&T)&T)&(!((((h&F)|F)&(!((j&F)|F)|T)))|F).

Further simplifications can be made:

((v&T)&T) is equivalent to (v&T), because T&T ones again is equal to T. 

((h&F)|F) is always F, because h can be either T or F but h&F will always return F.

Similarly, (j&F)|F, will always give F 

Next, the whole part (!((h&F)|F)&!(j&F)|T)) simplifies to just T because we are having !F & T which is equal to true.

Then observe the expression F&T. Same logic as before, it is always F.

Replace F&T by F in the formula, we get:

(((g&(((F|F)&F)|(!(F&(F|T))))))|F)|(F&(p|(v|T)))).

Then realize that F|F is also F. Replace them, we get:

(((g&(F&F)|(!(F&(F|T))))))|F)|(F&(p|(v|T)))).

We know that F&F is always F:

(((g&F)|(!(F&(F|T))))|F)|(F&(p|(v|T)))).

We also know that anything AND False is False, so g&F is F:

((F|(!(F&(F|T))))|F)|((F&(p|(v|T)))).

F&(F|T) is F because of the AND with False:

((F|(!F))|F)|((F&(p|(v|T)))).

Here, !F is T because not False is True:

(T|F)|((F&(p|(v|T)))).

T|F is T because one of them is True, which is enough for logical OR to return True:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify (T&F) this will result in F because True AND False is always False. 

Next, !(F) will be simplified to T because NOT False equals True. 

Starting with the innermost, (r|F) can be simplified to r, because something OR false is always just the original something.

Similarly, (g|(g&(!F))) can be simplified to g, because something OR (something AND true) is always just that something (g in this case).

(((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F)) simplifies to r&T, due to the steps above. And since (T&F) is F, thus it becomes r&F. Anything AND false is always false, so it simplifies to F. 


Coming outer brackets, (g|(((((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F))|r)&F)) this entire part simplifies to g since the complex expression equals to F due g|F simplifies to g.

2. T&F or T&F is also equal to False. By simplifying these, o|F = o and T& False = False.
So we continue to simplify the formula to: ((s | (o & F)&F) & T& T) | (False | False)&F) | True.

3. Anything AND False is False, so (o & F) and (False | F) are all equal to False. And anything AND True remains the same,Therefore we can simplify formula to: (s | False) | False | True.

3. Simplify (!(!(T&(T&T)))). Since T&(T&T) equals T, its negation gives false, !T = F. The negation of false (!F) gives true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, simplify c|c to c, because or-ing a value with itself will just produce the same value.
2. Simplify T|T to T, because or-ing true with anything will always be true.
3. Simplify F|(T&T) to F|T, because anding true with true results in true.
4. Simplify F|T to T, because or-ing false with true results in true.
5. Simplify !T to F, because the not operator inverts the truth value, thus !true equals false.
6. Simplify T|F to T, because or-ing true with anything will yield true.
7. Simplify F|(F|(T|T)) to F|F|T, because or-ing true with anything results in true.
8. Simplify F|F|T to T, because or-ing false with true results in true.
9. Simplify m|T to T, because or-ing anything with true will always result in true. 
10. Simplify l|T to T, because or-ing anything with true will always result in true.
11. From above, we can condense to (c&T&T), and this simplifies to c&T, because and-ing anything with true will always result in the original value.

So the simplified result of your logic formula is c&T, which represents the logical and of c and true. To fully simplify: c&T effectively simplifies to just c, since and-ing with true does not change the value of c.",c,c

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, ensure that the value of 'F&T' is always 'F' and 'v|T' is always 'T' (because Or operation with True always results True). So the expression simplifies to:

(((x&((x&T)|x))&((x&((x&T)&T)|F))&F)

Next, 'x&F' is also always 'F', and 'x&'T is 'x' (because And operation preserves the value of 'x' if 'T' is used). Hence, the expression gets simplified to:

((x&x)&(x&x)&F)

Where, 'x&x' equals 'x', hence the simplified expression is 'x&F'. 

And lastly, we know that 'x&F' equals 'F'. So the simplified logic formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, (T&T)&F leads to T&F which equals to F.
Then, ((((T&T)&F)&F)&T) becomes (F&F)&T, which simplifies to F&T, or simply F.
Then, (!((T&((!(f&((q&T)&F)))&F))&(!(!F)))) simplifies to (!((T&((!(f&(q&F)))&F))&(!T)))).
Then, q&T&F) simplifies to q&F, which equals F, so (T&((!(f&(q&F)))&F))&(!T) simplifies to (T&((!F)&F))&(!T).
(!F) simplifies to T, so the expression further simplifies to (T&(T&F))&(!T).
As T&F is F, the expression simplifies to (T&F)&(!T) which further simplifies to F&F equals to F.
Therefore, the simplified version of the boolean expression is F.",F,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The simplification of the formula would be as follows:

1. Replace all the instances of ""m & m"" and ""m | m"" with just m. Reason: Something ""and-ed"" or ""or-ed"" with itself will just give the same thing.
2. Your formula would then be: (((m|m)|F)|(T&((F|T)&T))&F)&m.
3. Similarly, in a logical OR operation, anything OR-ed with false gives the original value, and in a logical AND operation, anything AND-ed with false gives a false. So replace ""m|F"" with m and ""T&F"" with F.
4. This would then simplify your formula to: (m|((T&(T&F))|F)&F)&m = (m|(F|F)&F)&m = (m|F&F)&m.
5. The logical OR operation gives anything if one of the values is true, so ""F | F"" gives F, and hence ""F & F"" will also give F.
6. Thus, we get (m|F)&m, which on simplifying further gives m&m = m.

So, the simplified form of the initial given logical operation is m.",m,m

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, note that False | anything is equal to anything. Thus:
F | T = T
F | c = c
So, we can update the given formula to:
((c|(c&T))&(s|T))

Now, note that True & anything equals anything. Therefore:
T & c = c
We can update the formula again:
(c|c)&(s|T)

Also, realize that anything | True equals True (similarly, anything & True equals True). Therefore:
c | True = True
s | True = True
We can update our formula again:
True & True

Finally, realize that True & True equals True. So our simplified formula is:

2. Then (v|F) is simply v. Therefore, the formula becomes ((v&v)&(((v&v)|(v|v))&v))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that the expressions (T|F) and (T&T) can be simplified to T and T respectively, because True OR False is always True, and True AND True is also always True. 

Next, any expressions of the form (l&l) where l is a literal value can be simplified to just l, because something ANDed with itself is always itself.

Additionally, the expression (l|(l&T)) can be simplified to l, because something ORed with itself (even with additional AND conditions) is always itself.

Finally, l&((l&l)&(((l&(l&T))&l)&((l&(l|l))&T))) can be simplified as l (as per above reasons).

Using these simplifications, the expression can be simplified as follows:

((l|(l&T))|(l&((l&l)&(((l&((T|F)&(T&T)))&l)&((l&(l|l))&T)))))

3. Similarly, T|anything always equals T (True OR anything is always True).
Hence, we get (T|(F&F)|!F).

4. F&F equals F, and !F equals T (! is the NOT operator, so it negates/switches the value).
So, the expression is further simplified to (T|F|T).

5. (F|T)&(F|F) -> T&F  (True 'or' any condition is always True, False 'or' False is always False)

9. (F&(s&(F|(!T)))) -> F  (Any condition 'and' False is always False)

Substituting these simplifications, the original formula ((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F))) simplifies to (!((T)&(F|F))). This simplifies further to !(T&F), which in turn simplifies to !F, which is T (True).
