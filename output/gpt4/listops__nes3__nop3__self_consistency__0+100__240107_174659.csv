[SM 7 1 [MIN 0 4 3]] [MAX [MAX 0 1 8] [MAX 4 5 9] 5] 5].

[MIN 0 4 3] = min(0, 4, 3) = 0. This simplifies our expression to
[SM 7 1 0] [MAX [MAX 0 1 8] [MAX 4 5 9] 5] 5. 

[SM 7 1 0] = (7 + 1 + 0) mod 10 = 8 mod 10 = 8. This simplifies our expression to
8 [MAX [MAX 0 1 8] [MAX 4 5 9] 5] 5.

[MAX 0 1 8] = max(0, 1, 8) = 8. This simplifies the expression to
8 [MAX 8 [MAX 4 5 9] 5] 5. 

[MAX 4 5 9] = max(4, 5, 9) = 9. This simplifies the expression to

[MAX 8 9 5] = max(8, 9, 5) = 9. This simplifies the expression to

For [SM 5 8 0], the sum of the numbers is 5 + 8 + 0 = 13. In this case, SM would output 13 modulus 10 = 3. 

Then, for [MIN 6 2 9], the minimum is 2.

And for [MIN 2 0 7], the minimum is 0.

[SM 9 [SM 3 2 3] [MIN 2 2 0]]

[SM 3 2 3] gives the sum of 3 + 2 + 3 = 8, but again, as SM gives a sum modulo 10, it becomes 8 modulus 10 = 8.

[MIN 2 2 0] gives 0 as the minimum number.

Now, our expression is:

[SM 9 8 0]

Performing SM operation on these values:

SM 9 8 0 results in 9 + 8 + 0 = 17, but again, as SM gives a sum modulo 10, it becomes 17 modulus 10 = 7.

- [SM 2 0 5] is (2 + 0 + 5) mod 10 which is 7.

The expression then simplifies to:

[MIN 4 7 [MAX 8 9 3]].

Then, let's continue simplifying:

- [MAX 8 9 3] is 9, the largest number.

The expression then simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the 'SM' operation, i.e., the sum modulo 10 operation. SM 2 0 3 = (2 + 0 + 3) mod 10 = 5. SM 5 6 2 = (5 + 6 + 2) mod 10 = 3. SM 9 7 4 = (9 + 7 + 4) mod 10 = 0.

Now replace these values in the original expression:
[MIN [MAX 5 3 6] 4 [MIN 7 [MIN 9 5 0] 0]]

Next, solve the 'MAX' operation, i.e., the maximum operation. MAX 5 3 6 = 6. 

Now replace this value in the expression:
[MIN 6 4 [MIN 7 [MIN 9 5 0] 0]]

Solve the 'MIN' operation. MIN 9 5 0 = 0. 

Now replace this value in the expression:

Now, solve the remaining 'MIN' operation. MIN 7 0 0 = 0. 

Now replace this value in the expression:
[MIN 6 4 0]

Finally, solve the final 'MIN' operation. MIN 6 4 0 = 0.

Next, we compute SM (sum modulo 10):
SM 5 1 4 = (5 + 1 + 4) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0
SM 2 4 1 = (2 + 4 + 1) mod 10 = 7 mod 10 = 7

That changes our expression to:

For the operation [MAX 2 1 4], the maximum between 2, 1, and 4 is 4.

For the operation [SM 6 8 8], the sum is 6+8+8=22, but it's modulo 10 so SM 6 8 8 = 2.

For the operation [MAX 6 9 6], the maximum between 6, 9, and 6 is 9.

Resolve the brackets again.

For the operation [SM 3 0 4], that's 3 + 0 + 4 = 7.

For the operation [MAX 2 6 9], the maximum is 9.

This gives:
