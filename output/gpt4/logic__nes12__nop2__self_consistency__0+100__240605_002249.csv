A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the expressions with definitive True and False values.
Not True (i.e. !T) = False.
Not False (i.e. !F) = True.
Then, F|True = True.
Also, X|True = True and X&True = X, where X is a literal value. 

Thus, you can simplify the given expression as follows:
((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|(!T))|(!(F|T))))|(w&(!T))))&T)|w))&((w&((F|(T&T))|T))|w))&(F|T))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","In logical expressions, the semantics are as following:
- T | Any Value is always T (True), because logical or with T always gives us True.
- F & Any Value is always F (False), because logical and with F always gives us False. 
- Also, the double negation !!A is equals to A

Starting with the innermost expressions and then simplifying gradually:

- (!F) is T
- ((F&(!(F&(d|T))))&F) simplifies to F, because F&(d|T) is F and its negation is T and then F&T is F.
- Similarly, (T|(T|F)) simplifies to T, so ((F&(T|(T|F)))|F) simplifies to F.
- So, the expression (((F&(!(F&(d|T))))&F)&(!((F&(T|(T|F)))|F))) simplifies to F.
- (T|T)|F is T.

Using these simple results, the initial complex expression simplifies as follows:
((T|F)|((((F&(!(F&(d|T))))&F)&(!((F&(T|(T|F)))|F)))|T))|(!((T|T)|F)))|(!T))|F)

2. The expression (l|(l|(l|l))) simplifies to l, since or'ing something with itself doesn't change its value.

3. The expression (F&F) simplifies to F, since and'ing something with False is always False.

4. The expression (l|((F&F)|F))&T simplifies to l&T as F&F or F always gives False and or'ing something with False doesn't change its value.

5. The expression T|((v|v)&F) simplifies to T, since (v|v)&F is always False (anything AND False is False), and T or False is always T.

2. Now the logical expression !(F|T) can be simplified, because F or T is always True and not of True is False (!True = False).

So, the expression becomes:
F&((((u&((((z&((False)|(s|(F|T))))&z)|T)|F))|u)&(!(((t&(T|(T&(m|T))))&t)&F)))&F).

3. Now the logical expression (F|T) can be simplified, because F or T is always True.

8. (t&T) simplifies to t, because anything logical AND with True will be the same value and that logical AND with F is F.

9. (t&F) is always F, because T&F is F and F&F is also F.

11. (u&T) simplifies to u, because anything logical AND with True will be the same value.

So, the expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, recall that:
- anything AND True is itself. So, (b&T) simplifies to b.
- anything OR False is itself. 
- not True is False, not False is True. Therefore, !(T|!T) is False (since T|!T is always True), and F&False is always False.
- anything AND False is False. Thus, False&T is False.
- anything OR True is True . So, F|T will always be True. 
- not True is False . So, !True is False.
- Anything without False is just itself. Hence, (r&r)&(l|(t&False)&f) simplifies to r&r&l.

Now, apply these rules to the given expression:
- (b&T) simplifies to b
- (b&b) simplifies to b
- b|b simplifies to b
- T&((F&!False)&T) simplifies to T&False&T, which in turn simplifies to False&T&False, leading to False.
- !((!r)&!False) simplifies to !(False&True), leading to True.
- True|False simplifies to True

Considering the first step in each bullet point at once, we simplify the expression to:

((((b&b)|b)|(b|(False|True))).

In the next series of steps, consider the second steps in each bullet point. This further simplifies the expression to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, recognize that:

- Any statement & T results in the statement itself (it's the identity for logical and).
- Any statement & F results in F (it's the zero for logical and).
- Any statement | T results in T (it's the zero for logical or).
- Any statement | F results in the statement itself (it's the identity for logical or).
- !F results in T (it's the negation of False).

Applying these simplification rules, the given formula simplifies to:

(a&a)&((u|u&u|u|u)&(a&a|T|T)|u&(F|F))

This simplifies further to:

a&(u&a|u&F)

Now, remember that any statement & F results in F. So we have:

a&(u&a)

2. Anything ""or"" with False (T|F or F|F or b|F etc.) simplifies to the value of the other arguement. For instance, the blocks like (T|F or (F|F) etc. would output T and F respectively.

3. Also, anything ""and"" with True (T&T or b&T) simplifies to the value of the other arguement. So, (b&T) simplifies to b. 

4. Furthermore, ""!T"" results in F, so the whole block ((((((b&T)&(T&T))&(!T))&T)&F) simplifies to F.

After these simplifications, the whole logic formulation looks like this:
((F|F|F)|F)|(T|F|T)

5. Anything ""or"" with True (F|T or T|T or b|T etc.) simplifies to True. Hence, (T|F|T) gives T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, take the innermost part of the expression and simplify it:
- `(((f&f)|f)&((T&T)&F))`: the expression `(f&f)|f` simplifies to `f`, and expression `(T&T)&F` is `F`.
- Thus, we simplify it to `f&F`, which is `F`.

Now we have the expression simplified to this form:
((z&((!(F&(!F))&(!(!T)))&F))|(!(F|(((l&((l|F)|l))|T)|T))).

Next, simplify the inner expression from this one:
- `F&(!F)`: this directly evaluates to `F`.
- After simplifying we get: `(z&((!F)&(!(!T)))&F)|(!(F|(((l&((l|F)|l))|T)|T)))`.

In the next step, remove double negation:
- `!F` is `T` and `!(!T)` is `T`, so the expression becomes `(z&(T&T)&F)|(!(F|(((l&((l|F)|l))|T)|T)))`.

Simplify:
- `(T&T)` evaluates to `T`, hence the expression becomes `(z&T&F)|(!(F|(((l&((l|F)|l))|T)|T)))`.
- Any expression with `T` and `F` with an operation `&` evaluates to `F`, thus `(z&T&F)` is `F`.
- Simplified expression: `F|(!(F|(((l&((l|F)|l))|T)|T)))`.

Next, simplify the right part of `|`:
- `(((l&((l|F)|l))|T)|T)`: simplifies to `T`, because `l|F` is `l`, `l|l` is `l`, `(l&T)` is `l`, and finally, `l|T` is `T`.
- Thus, this part `(F|T)` becomes `T`.
- The whole expression then becomes `F|(!T)`.

3. Taking conjunction with T or disjunction with F does not change the value. So, (e&F), (F&(T&T)), and (e&T) become e, F, and e, respectively.

- Replacing `T | value` and `value & T`, `value & F` with T, value and F respectively and `!F` with T:

   (((l&((v&((T|((p&((T)|((T&F)&(F|F))))&(F|(F|F))))|T))|T))&T)&((l&(F|((T)|F)))|l))

- Simplifying inner brackets:

   (((l&((v&((T|(p&T))&F))|T))&T)&((l&F)|l))

- After replacing expressions of type `value & F` with F and `value | T` with T again:

   (((l&(v&T))+T)&T)&((F)|l))

- As `T & v` is v itself, we have:

   ((l&v+T)&T)&l

- And `l + T` gives T because of `value | T` == T

   T & l

- Last expression `T & l` gives l itself

- T & P: It will return P, because 'and' with True doesn't change the value.
- P & P: It will return P, because 'and' with itself doesn't change the value.
- F | P: It will return P, because 'or' with False doesn't change the it.
- P | P: It will return P, because 'or' with itself doesn't change the it.
- T | P: It will return T, because 'or' with True is always True.
- F & P: It will return F, because 'and' with False is always False.
- !P: It will return the opposite of P.

Applying above properties:

1. Let's simplify ((((T | (F | (T & (J | T)))) | T) & (((I | (I & (I | I))) | T) | F)) | (T & T))).
- (((T | (F | (T & (J | T)))) | T) & (((I | (I & (I | I))) | T) | F)) simplifies to T
- (T & T) simplifies to T
- So (((((T | (F | (T & (J | T)))) | T) & (((I | (I & (I | I))) | T) | F)) | (T & T)))) simplifies to T | T which is T.

So the whole phrase will simplify to:
(((c & T) & c) & (c | ((!((K & K) | T)) & (T | F)))). 

2. Applying properties to second part of formula:
- ((k & k) | T) simplifies to ((K | T) which is T.
- Using Not operation !T simplifies to F.
- (T|F) simplifies to T 

So the whole phrase will now simplify to:

- (c & T) will be c.
- (F & T) will be F.

Next, we can simplify a number of expressions inside the formula:

(T|(T&(!(!t)))) turns to (True | (True & t)) -> True (since True OR anything is True)

We can also simplify the expression (False|(True&False)) as follows: 

(False|(True&False)) -> (False | False) -> False

Now we can substitute these into our formula:

--> ((False|(!(True|False)))|(!False|True))

Next step is to simplify the NOT operations:

(!True) is False and (!False) is True, yielding:

3. Then we see another sub-formula: d&(!(((d|(T|(r&(i&(F&(F|T))))))|F)|T))). We know that any logical or with T will also equal T. Thus, this sub-formula will be reduced to d&(!T), which equals F because not T equals F and d & F is always F.

3. Simplify (T | F), which is equivalent to (True OR False) = T.
4. Simplify (F | T), which is equivalent to (False OR True) = T.

Therefore, the simplified formula so far is: ((((F)&F)&(!((!((F|(T|T)|F)|(v|T))))&(T&F)))&(w&F)).

Next, we will simplify the expression with NOT:
5. Simplify (!((F|(T|T|F)|(v|T)))), which is equivalent to NOT (False OR True OR True OR v OR True). As ""False OR True"" is always True, we get NOT(True) = F.

Let us first simplify the innermost expressions:
1. `(u|u) = u`, `(T|F) = T`, `(F|T) = T`, so the expressions become `u` and `T`, and `T`, respectively.
2. `T & T = T`, `F & T = F`, so the expression becomes `T` and `F`.

(((k|F)|F)&(T&((T&F)&((T&F)|((r|(((x&(!T&!F))|T)|F)|T))))
```

2. Next, `!T` results in F, `!F` results in T. Expression becomes:
```
(((k|F)|F)&(T&((T&F)&((T&F)|((r|(((x&(F&T))|T)|F)|T))))
```

3. Then, F&T results in F. Let's simplify that:
```
(((k|F)|F)&(T&((T&F)&((T&F)|((r|((x|T)|F)|T))))
```

4. At this stage, we see a lot of '|' and '&' operations with T and F. Recall that anything OR-ed (|) with F is itself, and anything AND-ed (&) with T is also itself. On the other hand, 'any value'|T is always True and 'any value'&F is always False. Apply these rules:
```
((k|F)&(T&((F)&((F)|(r|(x|F)|T))))
```

This simplifies to:
```
((k&F)&(T&T&r&x))
```

5. Now, anything AND-ed with F is F. Anything AND-ed with T is itself. Apply these rules:
```
F&T&r&x
```

6. Anything AND-ed with F is F, so the simplified logic formula is:

2) (!F) => T.
3) (T&F) => F - take this with the precedence of logical OR.
4) (F|T) => T. 

Now substitute those back into the formula.

5) (t|(((i&T)&T)|T)|T) => (t|T|T) => T, because any value OR with T gives T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The expression `F & Something` results in False regardless of the value of `Something`, because logical *and* needs both values to be True to result in True. So, `F&((F&(p&F))&T)` is reduced to `F`.

2. Any expression that has `T` in logical *or* will always result in True, because logical *or* needs at least one value to be True to result in True. Therefore, `b|T` is `T`.

3. `!F`, which is logically *not False*, is `T`.

4. Likewise, `F | F` is `F`, and `n | F` is `n`.

5. Similar to step 1, `Expression & F` will always be False regardless of `Expression`, so `(((n|F)|((((n|(((F&T)|F)|(!(F|T))))|(n|(F|F)))&(b|T))&(!F)))&F)` is reduced to `F`.

6. Let's now consider the entire expression `((F&((F&(p&F))&T))&(T|(F|(((n|F)|((((n|(((F&T)|F)|(!(F|T))))|(n|(F|F)))&(b|T))&(!F)))&F)))`. As described in step 1, `Expression1 & F` requires `Expression1` to be True to give the result as True, but because it's `F`, the result will always be False.

2. Anything OR with T results in T and anything AND with F results in F, which simplifies the formula to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We have that !(w|(F|T)) translates into !(w|T) because F|T = T by the identity law.
2. !(w|T) = F because !(T) = F.
3. So we get ((((c&(T&(!(f|F)))))&c)|F).
4. The formula simplifies to ((((c&(T&(!f))))&c)|F) because f|F = f by the identity law.
5. This is equivalent to ((c&T&!f&c)|F), which simplifies to ((c&!f&c)|F) because T&A = A for any propositional variable A.
6. (c&!f&c)|F simplifies to c&!f or F, since A&A = A.
7. Also, ((z|F)&T&F) simplifies to (z&T&F) because A|F = A for any proposition A.
8. On further simplification, this becomes (z&F) because A&T = A.
9. (z&F) reduces to F because A&F = F for any proposition A. So, the part that says !(z|F)&T&F simplifies to !F.
10. This gives c|c&c&!!F, which is equivalent to c|c&c&T because !!A = A for any proposition A.
11. According to the absorption law, A&A = A, so your formula simplifies down to c|c&T which further simplifies down to c|T.

    - T & F = F
    - T | T = T
    - F | !F = T
    - !F = T

So replacing these values in our formula:

(((((v & T)&v)|(!((((e&T)|(T|F))|F)| F ))|((c&F)&T)))&F)&F)&(!(F|T))

2) Now, simplify again for any statement that includes T and F and also using ""De Morgan's Law"", we get:

    - T | F = T
    - c & F = F 
    - v & T = v
    - e & T = e
    - F = F
    - !(F | T) = !T = F
    - !(T) = F

So replacing these values in our formula:

(((((v&v)|(((e|T)|F)| F ))|F)&F)&F)&F

3) Simplify again using known identities:

    - v & v = v
    - e | T = T
    - T | F = T
    - F | F = F
    - F & F = F

So replacing these values in our formula:

(((((v)|T)|F)&F)&F)&F

Then, 

    - v | T = T
    - T | F = T
    - F & F = F

So replacing these values in our formula:

Secondly, `F & x` is always `F` and `T & x` is always `x`, wherever `x` can be any literal or expression, so replace all `F & x` , `x & F`, `T & x` and `x & T`.

Thirdly, `!F` is `T` , so replace all `!F`.

Finally, `x | x` is simply `x` and `x & x` is `x`, so replace them properly.

3. (F|F|F) is always F. Therefore, we replace ((F|F)|F) with ""F"".
4. (T|Anything) always reduces to T. So, we replace (T|(!(((F&T)&T)&T))) by ""T"".

2. For ((c&F)&((T&((k|((T&(!T))|F))|T)))|(q&((T|((x&(!T))|T))&F))) we have F, because anyLiteral & F = F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the logical not, and operations:

- !(F | (F & anything)) because ""F and anything"" is F and ""F or anything"" is anything and ""! anything"" = anything. So, this part becomes !F which is T as ""not false"" is true.

Secondly, let's simplify the logical or operations:

- F | T, here ""F or anything"" is anything, so this part becomes T.
- F | o, here also ""F or anything"" is anything, so this replaces F | o with o.
- o & o & T, as anything AND true is the same thing, and o AND o is o, so this part simplifies to o.
- o & F, as anything NOR false is false, this part actually will simplify to F as the next steps do not matter.
- (((n | F) & n) & h), here ""n or false"" is n and ""n and n"" is n, so this simplifies to n & h.

Finally, taking all these simplifications into account, the entire expression simplifies as follows:

    ((T)&(((a|F)|((a&(T|(T|T)))&(f|(!(((v|(v|((v&v)|(F))))&(((x&T)&x)&F))&(T))))))&(F))).

2. Since a|F is equivalent to a and T|(T|T) is equivalent to T, the expression can be further simplified as follows:

   ((T)&(((a)|((a&T)&(f|(!(((v|(v|((v&v)|(F))))&(((x&T)&x)&F))&(T))))))&(F))).

3. Since (((v|(v|((v&v)|(F)))) is equivalent to V and ((x&T)&x)&F is equivalent to F, then (!((v|(v|((v&v)|(F)))&((x&T)&x)&F))) is equivalent to T the expression can be further simplified as follows:

   ((T)&(((a)|((a&T)&(f|(!(v&F))&(T))))))&(F))).

4. (V&F) is equivalent to F and (!(v&F)) is equivalent to T, so the expression can be further simplified as follows:

   ((T)&(((a)|((a&T)&(f&T))))&(F)).

5. Since ((a&T)&(f&T)) is equivalent to (a&f&T), the formula can be further simplified to:

   (T&((a)|(a&f&T)))&F.

6. Since x|y = y|x, the formula can be simplified as:

5. Hence, T&(n&((F&(F|T))|T)) = T&(n&((F&F)|T)) = T&(n&(F|T)) = T&(n&T) = T&n both are true because T = true and n = n.
6. Thus, the current formula becomes (T&n)|(!T).
7. Since !T = F, we get (T&n)|F = T&n, because anything OR False is itself.

Next, we can substitute (T&(!T)) and (F|T) by F and T, since T and not T is always false and false or true is true:

Now the formula would be:
(!(((((((t|F)|F)&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)|(F&(T|(!(F|a)))))))

Then we replace (t|F) with t since any value or'd with False becomes the value, and T&F and F&T with F:

So the formula becomes:
((!(((t&t)&F)&F))|(F&(T|(!a))))

The AND operation of a variable with itself (like t&t) stays the same, so:

This becomes (turning F&F and F|X into F and X):
((!(t&F)&F)|(!A)))

So anything and'd with false becomes false again, therefore:

((!F&F)|(!a))

Anything and'd with false is false:

(h|(F|(T|T))) simplifies to h|T, and then further simplifies to T.

2) (!(w|(!(F&((((z|z)|T)&F)&((!((F&T)|(T&T)))|T))))): Here we can use the principle that in an OR operation if one operand is True then the result is certainly True. So, ((z|z)|T = T, (!((F&T)|(T&T))) = T, hence

3. d&d = d, because the result of an AND operation is the value of the literal if they are the same.
4. Using the information from the points 1 and 2: the following parts of the expression can be simplified:
    - ((F&F)|F) = F
    - (((F&(n&F)) & s)) = F
    - ((.......s)) becomes irrelevant because anything AND F = F.
5. Therefore, the following part of the original expression (d&d)&T will simplify to d&T = d because anything AND T = same thing.
6. Continuing, the following parts from the expression will simplify to:
    - m&F = F, using similar reasoning as in point 2.
    - F | (d&T) simplify to d&T = d, using the rule AND T = same thing from point 5.
7. In overall, we can simplify the whole expression to d | T, because anything OR T = T.

Final Answer: T. This is because in a logical OR statement, if either value is true, the result is true. So, it doesn't matter if 'd' value is true or false.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical not symbol ! flips the value of F and T, so !F becomes T and !T becomes F.
Additionally, true (T) combined with any logical binary operator and any expression gives the original expression and false (F) combined with any logical AND operator and any expression gives false.

With these in mind, let's simplify the expression:

1. ((c|F)|((c&((F&(!F))|(T&((((q|F)&(((q|q)|(q|F))|(q|q)))|q)|(!(!T))))))|(c&(c|c))))&(!T)).

Expression F & (!F) turns to be F & T, which is False. True ANDed with any expression gives the expression itself, q|F and q|q both simplify to q. Therefore, (q|q) simplifies to q. Likewise, !(!T) turns to T. 

2. We get the expression to be ((c|F)|((c&(F|(q|T))))|(c&c))&F.

Since c|F simplifies to c and c&c simplifies to c, 

3. We end up with c|(c&c)&F.

F ANDed with any expression results in F, thus c&F simplifies to F.

Next, for any part of the formula that includes '&', if 'F' is one of the literals, the entire statement evaluates to 'F'. If 'T' is one of the literals, it does not affect the outcome:

- ((F|F)) = F.
- ((F|(T&(F|(w&F))))) = (F| (T & F)) = F.
- ((F&(T&(F&((F&T)&F))))) = F.
- (x&F) = F.
- (c&T) is unaffected.

Also, for any part of the formula that includes '|', if 'T' is one of the literals, the entire statement evaluates to 'T'. If 'F' is one of the literals, it does not affect the outcome:

""d or d"" can only be ""d"", simplifying the expression further:

(F&(d|T))|(T&((F|((F&(F&F))|F))&((u&(T&((((T&T)&F)&(T&((x|T)|(F|F))))|(!T))))&F))) ->

   a|T = T
   v&(v&(v&v)) = v
   p&F = F 
   F|F = F
   T|F = T
   F|T = T

2. Replacing these into the expression we get:

3. In this case, we know T&F = F and w|F = w and w&F = w. Also !T = F. Using these, we get:
  w & w | (F | (T | (!(T|v|T)|F)) & F) | F

4. We proved that T|T|T = T, T&F = F, and F|F = F before, so:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the innermost expressions regarding the logical constants T and F.

Here are few logical simplifications for your reference:
- Any value OR-ed with False results in the value itself (F | X = X)
- Any value AND-ed with True results in the value itself (T & X = X)
- Any value OR-ed with True results in True (T | X = T)
- Any value AND-ed with False results in False (F & X = F)
- Negation of True is False and vice versa (not T = F , not F = T)

Applying the above referenced simplifications, 
we have :

(!((F|(T|(!T)))|T)) turns into = !(T | T) which is = F
- T | (!T) will be T as anything OR-ed with its negation is always True
- Then F OR T results in T
- And T OR-ed with T is still T.
- Then you are negating T, which gives False.
  
((!(!T))&T) turns into T & T, which is T 
- Applying double negation law which states that negation of negation brings back the original literal (!(!X) = X)

( T & (T & (!((F & T) & (!T)))) simplifies to T & (T & F), which is T & F, which is F (because anything AND-ed with its negation is always False)
- Simplifying the negated component first, we have F & T & T, which is F (since anything AND-ed with False gives False)
- Then you have T AND-ed with its negation, which gives False.

(F&((j&T)|F)) turns into F & (j&T), which is F 
- Anything OR-ed with False will be the original literal,
- And anything AND-ed with False will be False.

Now, substituting these back into your expression, we have :

- Anything AND-ed with False will be False, so this will be False.

Therefore, your expression simplifies to False.",F,F

1) Let’s start with basic simplification of constants and identities -
Remember:
- X|T is always equal to T, 
- X|F is always equal to X, 
- X&T is always equal to X, and 
- X&F is always equal to F, 
- !F is T and 
- !T is F.

First, apply these rules to inner brackets. 
(g|T) simplifies to T,
(T|F) simplifies to T,
(!F) simplifies to T

Put it back in the expression, you get:
(((h|(((((h|h)&T)&(h&((h|(h&T))&(F|(T&T))))))&T))|F))&h)&(a|((T&T)|F))

2) Further simplification leads to:
 (((h|(((((h|h)&T)&(h&((h|(h&T))&(F|T))))))&T))|F))&h)&(a|((T&T)|F))

This can be rewritten as:
 (((h|((h&T)&(h&(h|T)))&T))|F)&h)&(a|(T|F))

3) We apply the identities again:
((h|((h&T)&h))
which can be rewritten as ((h|h)&h)

Remaining part simplifies to: 
(a|(T|F)) which is (a|T) and then simplifies to T.

2. (F|(h&F)) -> Since anything AND false is false, this term simplifies to (F|F), which results in FALSE.

- F & T = F
- T | F = T
- F | T = T
- !(F) = T
- !(T) = F
- n & n = n
- l & F = F
- t | T = T

Use these simplifications to rewrite the formula:

((p | (F | (T | !T))) & T) & !(T & (T & (F | n) & F | T))

Now, further simplify:
- F | (T | !T) = F | T = T
- T & (T & (F | n) & F | T) = T & F = F

This leaves us with the simplified formula:

- T & T = T
- T & !F = T

2. Next, look at T|(!T).
This is a tautology, as T or not T will always be True.
So, the formula becomes: ((s&((s&((F|((F&(w&F))&((((a&T)&T)&((a&a)&T))&(a&a)))|T)))|T))|F).

3. You then simplify any statement that says 'False & something' (F&anything) to False, because conjunction (&) with False is always False. 
You also simplify 'True or something' (T|anything) to True because disjunction (|) with True is always True.
The formula now is: ((s&((s&(F|F|T|T))|F))|((!F)&F)).

4. Within the parentheses, you have (F|F) and (T|T) is False and True, respectively.
The formula is now: ((s&((s&(F|T))|F))|(!F&F)).

So, we rewrite the question as:

Continue the simplification through the repeated applications of the identity laws above.

Similarly, (F & Anything) is always False because False and anything else is always False. Same for the operation (!T & F), it is also False because it means not True and False which is always False. 

Additionally, (Anything | F) is just Anything, because or operation with False does not change the original value.

On the other hand, (Anything & T) is just Anything, because and operation with True does not change the original value.

Also, (g & g & g | g ) simplifies to just g.

Using these rules, the given formula can be simplified as:

2. F&F means False and False, which is False (F).

4. Now, we see some similar pattern like ""T or anything"" and ""False and anything"". According to laws of logical operations, these are designated as 'identity laws'. T|anything = T (True or anything is always True, because 'or' operation requires at least one value to be true to return true), F&anything = F (False and anything is always False, because 'and' operation needs both values as true to return true).
5. Let's use these rules to reduce the formula.

Applying these rules, the formula becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F|anything = anything and anything|F = anything. So, we can simplify (s|F) = s and (((l|F)|T)&F) = ((l|T)&F) = F, ((j|j)|F) = j, ((z&(z&z))&T)|T = T.
2. T|anything = T and anything|T = T. So, (T|(!(((F|F)&F)&T))) = T and and ((p&(j|T))|T) = T.
3. F&anything = F and anything&F = F. So, (s|(T&F)) = s|F = s.
4. The entire formula is now (s|(F&T)). Using the rules from steps 1 and 3 again, we simplify this to s.

So, the simplified form of the logic formula is just the variable ""s"".",s,s

((x&(F|(F&(!(!((v|(!(y&(!(!F)))))&(!((F&(T&(F&T)))&F))))))))&(((!((!(T|F))|T))&T)&T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, we simplify the elements involving T and F:
1. !(T|F) = !(True | False) = False
2. T&F = False
3. !F = True
4. F&T = False
5. !(y & (!(!F)) = not(y & True) = not(y) = !y
6. F | anything = anything. In this case, we have two instances: F | (F& whatever) which simplifies to F, and then F | x simplifies to x.
7. Now the term !((F&(T&(F&T)))&F) simplifies to !((False & True) & False) = !False = True.
8. The term v | !(y& True) simplifies to v | !y.
9. (!(!((v | !(y & True))) & True) turns into (!(not(v | not(y)) & True) = (v | !y) & True = (v | !y).
10. ((x & (F | (F & (v | !y)))) simplifies to ((x & (False | (False & (v | !y))) = (x & False) = False.
11. Then we have (!(!False | T))&T)&T simplifies to (True & T) & T = T & T = T.
12. Finally, we have (False & T) which simplifies to False. 

So the formula is simplified to False.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F&F results to F.
2. T|T results to T, T&T is also T, F|T results to T.
3. !(F|F) results to !F which is T, and any expression OR-ed with T results to T.
4. The given expression simplifies to ""w | w | w | F | (w & !q) | w | T"" 

Let's breakdown this further:

5. w OR w is still w. 
6. w & !q effectively reduces to just !q when it's ORed with w, because if w is True the whole expression is true, regardless of !q, and if w is False, !q would determine the value it takes.
7. F OR-ed with any value will always take the value of the other operand, therefore we can discard it.
8. For any expression OR-ed T, the expression will always yield to T.

So, the final simplified expression is: T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Let's deal with the brackets from inside out. The formula `(F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T` simplifies to `(F|F|F|T)&T` because `a|T` always equals T. And that simplifies further to `T&T` and then to `T`, because anything OR'd with F is itself and anything AND'd with T is also itself. 

2. We can simplify the expression `((F|(F&(!((F|F)&T))))|F)` to `(F|F|F)` because `F&T` is always False and hence its negation is true. The formula thus simplifies to `F`, as anything OR'd with F is equivalent to itself.

3. The main formula then simplifies to `(((o|(o&(o&(((T)))|F))))|((v|(e|(T|(f&F)))|T)))` and then further simplifies to `(((o|(o&o))|F)|((v|(e|T|F))|T))`.

4. Since `o&o` is `o`, the formula simplifies to `(o|F) | ((v|e|T)|T)`, and then to `(o|((v|e|T))|T)`,

5. Finally, since anything OR'd with T is T, the whole expression simplifies to `T`.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value and with False (F) is always False (F). So we can simplify the formula like this:
   (F&-)&(T | T&(!(y & F))) | F)
   -> F & (T | T&(!y & F)) | F

2. Similarly, not False (F) is always True (T). So we continue simplifying:
   -> F & (T | T&(!y & T)) | F

3. Then anything or-ed (|) with False is the thing itself and anything or-ed with True is True (T):
   -> F & T | F
   -> F | F
   -> F

So, the simplified logic formula is F.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. As we know, the logical and of any value with False is always False. This means `(F&((!T)&T))`, `(((o|o)|o)&F)`, `((F&F)&(F|T))` all simplify to `F`. 
2. Similarly, the logical and of any value with True is always that value. So, `T&(((F&((!T)&T))|T)&F)` simplifies to `T&F` which further simplifies to `F`. 
3. Having a logical or between any value and False is always that value. Therefore, `(y|(T&(((F&((!T)&T))|T)&F)))` simplifies to `y|F`, which further simplifies to `y`. 
4. The logical not operator will reverse the boolean value. So `(!T)` simplifies to `F`.
5. If you have logical or between identical values like `(o|o)`, it simplifies to that value which in our case is `o`.
6. Applying the logical and of a value with False gets always False, which means `((((o|o)|o)&F)&((!((F&F)&(F|T)))&F))` simplifies to `F`.

So, the simplified form of the given logic formula is `y`.",y,y
