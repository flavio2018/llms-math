0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula given involves an ""or"" operation between some proposition ""h"" and the truth value ""true"" (T). In ""or"" operations, if any of the inputs or propositions is ""true"", the whole statement is considered ""true"". Hence, the simplified form of this expression would be ""true"" (T) irrespective of the value of ""h"". So, (h|T) simplifies to T.",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In a logical OR operation, if either of the values is true, then the result is true. Since T represents True, this means the result of F|T will be True, or T.",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","This logic expression is already simplified. The expression states that both ""v"" and ""T"" (True) need to be true. So, if ""v"" is true then the entire statement is True, but if ""v"" is False, then the entire statement is False.",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The or gate ""|"" will output true if either or both of its inputs are true. In the given expression ""(o|F)"", the other literal value is False ""F"". Therefore, the output of the expression will be only based on the value of ""o"". Hence, the simplified formula is ""o"".",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical or operator (|) returns True if at least one of the operands is True. So if one operand is already False (which cannot change because it's a constant), the expression depends only on the other operand.

Thus, the simplified formula is just (q).",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In any ""logical and"" operation, if one of the operand is false, the result is always false, regardless of the value of the other operand. In your formula, one operand is clearly False (F), so the result is false(F).",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (w&w) is equivalent to simply w. This is because any value ANDed with itself will remain the same (True & True = True, False & False = False). Therefore, the simplified expression is just w.",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical or operation ""|"", when one of the operands is F (False), is equivalent to the other operand. So, your formula can be simplified to just ""b"".",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula given is (o|o) which represents a logical or operation between o and o. 

In logical or operation, if either of the inputs or both is true, the result is true.

So, regardless of whether o is true or false, the result would be the same as o. Therefore, (o|o) simplifies to o.",o,o
