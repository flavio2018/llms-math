& - both sides of the operation must be true to result in true (logical and)
| - at least one side of the operation must be true to result in true (logical or)
! - negates the value of the operation that follows (logical not)

From these rules, we can make some general observations:
- F&F, F&T, T&F will always result in F
- T&T will always result in T
- T|F, F|T, T|T will always result in T
- F|F will always result in F
- !T will always result in F
- !F will always result in T

So, applying these rules we get:

F|T results in T, so ((F|T)&T) simplifies to T&T which simplifies to T. We substitute T in place of ((F|T)&T) in our original formula.

(((T|T)|F)) simplifies to T|F which simplifies to T. We substitute T in place of (((T|T)|F)) in our original formula.

((F|(((m|m)&F)&T)) simplifies to (F&) since m|m results in m and ((m&F)&T) results in F. Therefore (F|F) simplifies to F. We substitute F in place of ((F|(((m|m)&F)&T)) in our original formula.

!(T&F) simplifies to !(F) since T&F results in F. Therefore, !(F) simplifies to T. We substitute T in place of !(T&F) in our original formula.

Finally, our initial formula looks like this: ((g|T|F)|T).

(g|F) simplifies to g, so the formula becomes ((g|T)|T), which further simplifies to (T|T) following the logic that g|T always results in T. Thus the final formula is T|T, which simplifies to T. Therefore, the whole logic formula simplifies to T (meaning ""true"").",T,T

Step 1:

(((((m&((f&T)|T))&(n|(F|(F|T))))&T)|T)&(((!T)&T)|T))

The brackets (f&T) in the first term give the result f because it's ""f AND true"", which is equal to f.

Step 2:

(((((m&(f|T))&(n|(F|(F|T))))&T)|T)&(((!T)&T)|T))

The brackets (f|T) in the first term give the result T because it's ""f OR true"", which is always true.

Step 3:

(((((m&T)&(n|(F|(F|T))))&T)|T)&(((!T)&T)|T))

The brackets (n|(F|(F|T))) in the first term give the result n|T because it's ""n OR false OR true"", which is always true.

Step 4:

(((((m&T)&T)&T)|T)&(((!T)&T)|T))

The second term within the first term is unnecessary because it's is ""true AND true"", which is just true. The brackets around (!T) & T are also not required because that would give the result false (""not true AND true"").

Step 5:

((((m&T)&T)|T)&(F|T))

Again, we simplify the operation ""false OR true"" to just true.

Step 6:

((m&T)&T|T))

The second ""AND T"" operation is not needed because ""m AND true"" already gives m.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, examine the operations inside brackets. 

The expression (F&T) is always False, because it requires both F and T to be true, which is impossible - one of them is always false. So we replace (F&T) with F. 

Also, we have (T&T) which is always True, because T is True. We can replace (T&T) with T.

So, the updated expression is :
((u&(u&((u|F&(!T)))&T)))|(!(((l&T)&T)|T)))

The next step would be simplifying F&(!T). As F is always false, F&(!T) is False too. 

And (T&T) is always True, we replace them with just T.

So, now the expression is :
((u&(u&((u|F)&T)))|(!((l&T)|T)))

Here, (u|F) is equivalent to u because ORing any value with False doesn't change the value. And (l&T) is equivalent to l because ANding any value with True doesn't change that value.

Hence,
((u&((u&u)&T)))|(!(l|T))

Since (u&u&u) is equal to u and (l|T) always equal to True:

(u&T)|(!T)

Finally we have

(u&T)|(!T)

Considering that, the value of !T is F and that, truth value of (u&T) is T if u is T otherwise F:

If u is T the value of the expression is T | F = T.
If u is F the value of the expression is F | F = F.

Next, the T&T reduces to T (since True AND True is True):

((h&h&T)|((h|((h&(T&F))|h))&h))|(h&h)).

Then, we simplify T&F which is F (since True AND False is False):

((h&h&T)|((h|((h&h)|h))&h))|(h&h)).

Similarly 'p&F' is always 'F', then ! F is T.

Therefore we can simplify the expression to:

Again applying simple laws of logic - a statement combined with 'False' using 'And' operator will always be false.

The logic diagram can now be reduced to,

A statement combined with itself using 'And' operator returns the statement itself. So, (F&F)=F. We get,
(F|((F)&(T|(!(T|(!(F|T))))))).

Looking at the next part of the equation, we know that logical 'not' of a 'True' statement is always 'False'. Hence, (!(T|T))=F, (!(F|T))=F. Also, logical 'not' operation reverses the boolean value of the statement, hence, (!(F))=T. So, the equation reduces to,
(F|((F)&(T|(!(T|T))))).

As per the logical 'or' operator, a statement combined with 'True' using 'Or' operator is always true. So, (T|T) = T. Hence, the equation further simplifies to,
(F|((F)&(T|!(T)))).

Next, as per the logical 'not' operator, the 'not' of a 'True' statement is always 'False'. Hence !(T) = F. The equation simplifies to,
(F|((F)&(T|F))).

As per the logical 'or' operator, a statement combined with 'True' using 'Or' operator is always true. Hence, (T|F)=T. We get,
(F|(F&T)).

As per the logical 'and' operator, a statement combined with 'False' using 'And' operator is always false. Thus, (F&T)=F. The equation reduces to,
(F|F).

Finally, a statement combined with itself using logical 'or' operator results in the statement itself. Hence, (F|F) = F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify (F&T). This is derived by the logical and (&) between F and T. Logical and returns True only if both values are True. Since F is False, the whole statement is False.

Next, (n&F) is False as we know logical and is True if both elements are True. Since F is False, the result is False.

Then, (F|F) is clearly False as logical or returns True if at least one value is True. Since both are False, the result is False.

So, we get (!((((F|(False))&(T|False))&False)&(!T))).

Then, (F|False) is False because logical or is True when at least one element is True. Both are False, so the result is False.

Also, (T|False) is True because the logical or operation returns True if at least one element is True.

So, we now have (!(((False&True)&False)&(!T))).

Thus, ((False&False)&(!T)) simplifies to (False&(!T)).

3. m|F simply simplifies to 'm' and (m|F)&m simplifies to m&m i.e., 'm' because m AND m always results in 'm'. 
4. Now ((((m|F)&m)|F)|T)|T) simplifies to ((m|F)|T) because 'T' OR anything always results to 'T'

With this knowledge we can start simplifying:

(!(F|F)) simplifies to !F which is T.

(T|(o|T)) is just T since anything OR T is T.

(F|(T|T)) is just T, again, anything OR T is T.

So ((F|(T|T))|((F|T)&F)) is actually (T|(T&F)).

Since anything AND F is F, (T&F) is F. Hence, the whole formula becomes (T|F) which is T. 

So the whole second part ""!((T|(o|T))|(F|((F|(T|T))|((F|T)&F))))"" simplifies to ""!(T|T)"" which is ""!T"" or F.

For the second part, a true OR any other boolean value is always true, so (T|((((T|F)|F)|(g&(!T)))|T)) simplifies to T. Since g&(!T) is always false (same as the first part), it can be simplified to (T|((T|F)|F)) which simplifies to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the expression ""F&F"" is definitely False (F), because False combined with False via an AND operation results in False.

Then, any expression in the form ""f|F"" implies the value of 'f', because if 'f' was True, the whole expression (f|F) would be True; and if 'f' was False, the whole expression (f|F) would be False. 

Also, F&f is equivalent to f&F and implies 'f' for the same reason as ""f|F"", and also for expression ""f&f"" because both operate with the same variable 'f', so the expression will follow the value of 'f'. 

Replacing these in the original terms gives us:
((f|(f|((((f&f)&f)&f)|f)))|(f&(f&(f|F)))) = ((f|((f&f)&f))|f)

But, as we know 'f&f' is just 'f' so the expression become:
((f|(f&f))|f).

Again we can simplify 'f&f' to 'f', then we get: 
(f|f)|f.

""f|f"" is definitely the value of 'f' itself.

Applying this simplification, our expression turns into:
((c|c)|c)&(((c&T)&c)|c)&c 

Moreover, any ""or"" statement with the same literals simplifies to a single instance of that literal. So (c|c) simplifies to c. Also, keep in mind that any ""and"" statement with True, returns the other term. Thus (c&T) equals c.

After applying these simplifications, the expression becomes:
c&c&c

The ""and"" statement will be true if all components are true. And if something is true, and we maintain the same statement one or multiple times, it's still true. Therefore, (c&c&c) simplifies to just c.

(w|F|T).

Now using the rule, anything or True is True, so (w|T) becomes T. The equation becomes:

(T|F).

Finally, anything or False is just the value itself, so the answer is:

T

So, the simplification of the given expression is True.",T,T
