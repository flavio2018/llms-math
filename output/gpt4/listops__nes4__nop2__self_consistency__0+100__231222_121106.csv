- [MAX 5 5] = 5, because 5 is the maximum number between 5 and 5.
- [MAX 7 6] = 7, because 7 is the maximum number between 7 and 6.

So the expression now becomes:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 7 6] [SM 5 7]] [MAX [MIN [SM 5 3] [MIN 1 4]] [MIN [SM 8 6] [MIN 4 8]]]].

Next steps:
- [MAX 7 6] = 7, because 7 is the maximum number between 7 and 6.
- [SM 5 7] = 12 modulo 10 = 2, because 5 + 7 = 12, and 12 modulo 10 is 2.

So now the expression is:

[MAX [MIN 7 2] [MAX [MIN [SM 5 3] [MIN 1 4]] [MIN [SM 8 6] [MIN 4 8]]]].

Next:
- [MIN 7 2] = 2, because 2 is the minimum number between 7 and 2. 

The expression is now:

[MAX 2 [MAX [MIN [SM 5 3] [MIN 1 4]] [MIN [SM 8 6] [MIN 4 8]]]].

Then:

- [MIN 1 4] = 1, because 1 is the minimum number between 1 and 4.
- [SM 8 6] = 14 modulo 10 = 4, because 8 + 6 = 14 and 14 modulo 10 is 4. 
- [MIN 4 8] = 4, because 4 is the minimum number between 4 and 8.

Update the expression to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, find the maximum of 3 and 2, which is 3. Then sum 4 and 0, which is 4. So the first part of the expression is now [SM [MAX 3 4]...] and when we compute the MAX, the result is 4.

In the second part, find the minimum of 8 and 0, which is 0, then sum 0 and 0, which is 0. So now the expression looks like [SM [MAX 4 0] ...] and when we take the maximum, again we get 4.

The third chunk [MIN [MIN [MIN 4 3] [SM 5 0]] [MAX [MAX 8 5] [SM 8 9]]]] requires several steps. First, find the minimum between 4 and 3, which is 3. Next, sum 5 and 0, and you get 5. So, this part of the expression now looks like [MIN [MIN 3 5] ...]

Secondly, in the MAX part of the expression starts with the maximum between 8 and 5, which is 8, and in the second SM part - the sum between 8 and 9 mod 10, which is 7 (since the sum is 17 and 17 mod 10 = 7). So the MAX part of the expression [MAX 8 7] simplifies to 8.

Finally, the last MIN [MIN [MIN 3 5] 8] gives us the smallest number, which is 3.

So, [SM 0 9] = 0 + 9 = 9, [SM 2 7] = 2 + 7 = 9, [SM 0 9] = 0 + 9 = 9, [SM 7 1] = 7 + 1 = 8, [SM 8 2] = 8 + 2 = 10 but because is modulo 10 that means result will be 0.

Step 3: Continue with the SM operator expressions and MAX.
[SM 9 9] = 9 + 9 = 18, but because it's modulo 10 the result is 8.
[SM 8 0] = 8 + 0 = 8.

Step 4: Continue with the SM operator expressions and MAX.

Third, let's repeat the process for the second part of the original expression, starting with the SM of 2 and 7. That's 9 (because 2 + 7 is 9). The MAX of 2 and 6 is 6. So, [SM [MIN [SM 2 7] [MAX 2 6]] becomes [SM [MIN 9 6]].

Fourth, the MIN of 1 and 4 is 1. The SM of 6 and 3 is 9 (since 6 + 3 is also 9). So, [MIN [MIN 1 4] [SM 6 3]] becomes [MIN 1 9].

We then have [SM 0 6], which resolves to 0 + 6 = 6.

Next, we have [MIN 1 1] which is just 1, and [SM 4 4] which equals to 8 (since 4 + 4 = 8 and we are dealing with modulo 10).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's solve the inside operations first. We have:
- [MAX 9 9] = 9 because MAX function will return the highest number
- [MAX 8 3] = 8 because MAX function will return the highest number
- [SM 4 0] = 4 because SM or sum modulo 10 is just the sum of numbers (as long as this sum is less than 10)
- [MIN 0 3] = 0 because MIN function will return the lowest number
- [MIN 4 9] = 4 because MIN will return the lowest number
- [MAX 7 8] = 8 because MAX will return the highest number
- [SM 8 7] = 5 because SM or sum modulo 10 is 15 mod 10, which equals 5

So, our expression will become:

Next step, we have:
- [MAX 9 8] = 9 
- [SM 4 0] = 4
- [MIN 4 8] = 4
- [SM 5 5] = 0 (as it equals 10 mod 10)

[SM 8 0] = (8+0) mod 10 = 8 mod 10 = 8

Simplify the next level of expressions:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the MIN and MAX operations:

MIN of 2 3 is 2

MIN of 4 9 is 4

So, SM of MIN 2 3 and MIN 4 9 is SM 2 4 = 6

Then:

MIN of 8 4 is 4

MIN of 7 5 is 5

SM of 7 and 8 is 15 but since it's modulo 10, we keep the last digit: 5

Then we have an empty MAX operation (MAX 1 1), because either value is 1.

So, SM of MIN 7 5 and MAX 1 1 is 6.

Next, calculate the MIN of MIN 8 4 and SM of MIN 7 5 and MAX 1 1 is MIN of 4 and 6, which is 4.

Then the MAX calculations:

SM of 0 and 7 is 7

SM of 4 and 6 is 10 (however, because we are taking modulo 10, we keep only the last digit, which is 0)

The MAX of SM 0 7 and SM 4 6 is 7.

SM of MIN operations (which is 6) and MAX operations (which is 7) now becomes SM 6 7 = 13.

[MIN [SM [SM 0 9] [MIN 6 7]] [MIN [MAX [SM 6 0] [MIN 1 2]] [MIN [MIN 6 5] [SM 1 5]]]].

Now, calculate the SM operation in [SM 6 0], the result is 6. MIN operation of the two numbers 1 and 2 in [MIN 1 2], results in 1. Now, calculate the the MIN operator in [MIN 6 5] which outputs 5 and the SM operation in [SM 1 5] which gives 6. So the expression becomes:

The SM between 0 and 9 gives 9 and the MIN between 6 and 7 results in 6. Let's evaluate it further:

The result of the SM operation 9 and 6 is 5 because we are taking a sum modulo 10:

Next, we have MAX operator among 6 and 1, which gives 6. While MIN operation on 5 and 6, results in 5. The expression becomes:

Then, in the next brackets where we have the results of these calculations,
MIN [SM 8 5] [SM 3 9] is MIN 3 2 which gives us 2, because 2 is the smaller number.

Similarly,

SM 7 0 gives us 7 + 0 = 7.

Next, 
[SM 2 8] = (2+8)%10 = 0, since 2+8 is 10 and we're taking modulo 10.
[MAX 8 4] = 8, since 8 is more than 4.

[MIN [SM [MAX 3 3] [MAX 7 1]] [SM [SM 2 8] [MAX 8 4]]] simplifies to MIN of 0 and 8, which is 0.

Now,
[MIN 9 0] = 0, since 0 is the minimum.
[MIN 3 0] = 0, again 0 is the minimum.
So, [SM [MIN 9 0] [MIN 3 0]] simplifies to SM of 0 and 0, which is 0.

Next,
[MAX 8 1] = 8, since 8 is the maximum.
[MIN 1 1] = 1, since both are same.
So, [SM [MAX 8 1] [MIN 1 1]] simplifies to SM of 8 and 1, which is 9.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to calculate the inner-most operations (""SM 1 7"", ""MAX 9 2"", ""MIN 5 2"", ""MIN 0 2"", ""MAX 8 1"", ""MIN 2 9""):

- ""SM 1 7"" equals 8 (as 1+7=8)
- ""MAX 9 2"" equals 9 (as 9 is larger than 2)
- ""MIN 5 2"" equals 2 (as 2 is smaller than 5)
- ""MIN 0 2"" equals 0 (as 0 is smaller than 2)
- ""MAX 8 1"" equals 8 (as 8 is larger than 1)
- ""MIN 2 9"" equals 2 (as 2 is smaller than 9)

Now, our expression is [MIN [MIN [SM 8 9] [MIN [MIN 8 8] [MAX 7 9]]] [SM [SM 2 0] [MIN 8 2]]].

On the next step, we calculate the resulting expressions (""SM 8 9"", ""MIN 8 8"", ""MAX 7 9"", ""SM 2 0""):

- ""SM 8 9"" equals 7 (as 8+9=17 and 17 modulo 10 is 7)
- ""MIN 8 8"" equals 8 (as both numbers are the same)
- ""MAX 7 9"" equals 9 (as 9 is larger than 7)
- ""SM 2 0"" equals 2 (as 2+0=2),

So our expression becomes: [MIN [MIN 7 [MIN 8 9]] [SM 2 [MIN 8 2]]],

and we have to calculate the last of the inner-most operations (""MIN 8 9"" and ""MIN 8 2""):

- ""MIN 8 9"" equals 8 (as 8 is smaller than 9)
- ""MIN 8 2"" equals 2 (as 2 is smaller than 8),

So our expression becomes: [MIN [MIN 7 8] [SM 2 2]],

Now, do the remaining operations (""MIN 7 8"" and ""SM 2 2""):

- ""MIN 7 8"" equals 7 (as 7 is smaller than 8)
- ""SM 2 2"" equals 4 (as 2+2=4),

So our final expression is: [MIN 7 4],

Solving it we get 4 (as 4 is smaller than 7). So, the answer is 4.",4,4

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate any single operations:

SM 0 3 = 3,

MAX 0 2 = 2,
SM 9 0 = 9,
MIN 0 3 = 0,
SM 9 6 = 5 (since 9 + 6 is 15, and 15 modulo 10 is 5),
MAX 6 9 = 9.

Then we substitute obtained values back into the original expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the innermost operations:

- The operation [SM 8 0] results in 8.
- The operation [SM 9 8] results in 7 (since 9 + 8 = 17 and 17 modulo 10 is 7).
- The operation [SM 9 2] results in 1 (since 9 + 2 = 11 and 11 modulo 10 is 1).
- The operations [MIN 4 4], [MIN 0 1], [MIN 7 2] all take the minimum value of the two numbers presented. So, they result in 4, 0 and 2, respectively.

With these operations solved, our expression is now reduced to:

- [SM 8 4] is equivalent to adding 8 and 4 together which is 12, and then taking the modulo with 10. So the result is 2.
- [MIN 7 [MAX 9 4]] is equivalent to checking the maximum between 9 and 4 first, which gives 9 and then taking minimum between 7 and 9. So the result is 7.
- [MAX 4 1] results in 4 (since 4 is greater than 1).

After substituting these results, our expression becomes [MIN [MAX 2 0] [MAX 7 4]], which simplifies to:

- [MAX 2 0] is 2 because 2 is greater than 0.
- [MAX 7 4] is 7 because 7 is greater than 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the inner MIN, MAX and SM operators;
