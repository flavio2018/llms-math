Let's take a look at the term !(!True). This double negation is equivalent to True because it's basically saying NOT NOT True which is True.

So replace !(!True) with True, and expression becomes:

Secondly, any literal AND F (F&T, F&n...) is F since the and logical operation requires both values to be true to qualify as true, and F alone negates the whole condition. So, (F&T) becomes F.

Then, any literal OR F (F|n, F|T...) value is the same as original value because or logical operation only needs one value to be true to qualify true, and F doesn't contribute, leaving the condition dependent on the value of the literal. Therefore, (F|F) becomes F.

Now the expression is:

!((!T)|(o|(c|T)))

Since c | T is always True (because we get True regardless of the value of c), we can simplify again:

- F | F is always F, since logical OR operation yields True only if at least one of the operands is True.
- !(F), which means NOT F, equals to T, since the logical NOT operation inverts the value of F.
- T & T is always T, since logical AND only yields True if both of the operands are True.
- T & F is always F, since logical AND only yields True if both of the operands are True.

   v&(v&v) is v&v, because v&v is v.

6. We are left with (!(e&((T)&F))|(T)) which is (!(e&F)|T), simplifies to (!F|T), eventually simplifies to T. Remember anything ""and"" False is False then not False is True. Hence anything ""or"" True is always True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, F|F is always F (False OR False = False) and T&F is always F (True AND False = False).
Next, note that (!F) is T (because not False is always True). So (e|(!F)) is always T because OR with true is always True.

Therefore, any variable OR-ed with True is True and any variable AND-ed with False is False. Hence, F|T, T&F, T|F and F|T are T, F, T, and T respectively.

Also, anything OR-ed with False doesn't change (F|e is e). Anything AND-ed with True doesn't change (T&e is e).

Let's simplify - ((((F|T)|(T&F))|F)|(e|(!F))) is (((T or F) or F) or T) which simplifies to T.

And lastly, anything AND-ed with False is always False. This simplifies the whole equation to - (F & T | T).

To simplify it further, because anything AND-ed with False is False, and anything OR-ed with True is True. Hence, we get the final answer:

!(!((((i&T)&((s&T)&F))|T)|(F&(!T))))

Step 2: Anything AND with False gives False. So, it simplifies to:

!(!(((i&T)&F)|T)|(F&(!T)))

Step 3: Anything AND with False is always False:

!(!((F)|T)|(F&(!T)))

Step 4: Anything OR with True is always True. So the expression simplifies to:

!(!T|(F&(!T)))

Step 5: Not True is always False and Not False is always True. So, the expression simplifies to:

!(!T|(F&T))

Step 6: False AND anything is always False:

!(!T|F)

Step 7: Not False is True, so the expression simplifies to:

2. (F&!T) is false. F is false and not T is false. So, the entire expression is false resulting into (((v|F)|F)|!T).

3. v|F simplifies to v, because 'v or false' only depends on the truth value of v. Hence, we get ((v|F)|!T).

4. Again, using the same logic 'or' with F simplifies to v. So, we have (v|!T).

5. T|(F|F) is also equivalent to T|F which is always True. 

6. Last part !(T|T) is equivalent to !T which is false.

2. (!T) -> This negates the value of T, which is always False. So replace !T with F. Formula becomes:
(T|(((q&(q|((q|F)&q)))|(((T&(T|T))|T)|F))&F)).
   
3. ((""T""&(T|T))|T) -> This will always be T, so replace the expression in the brackets with T. The formula now becomes:
(T|(((q&(q|((q|F)&q)))|T)&F)).

4. (q|F) -> This will always be the value of q, as the OR operation with False maintains the original value. So replace (q|F) with q. The formula now becomes:
(T|(((q&(q&(q&q)))|T)&F)).
   
5. (q&q) -> This will always be the value of q. So replace (q&q) with q. The formula now becomes:

6. Now we have the conjunction operation q&q again, so replace it with just q to get:
(T|((q&q|T)&F)).

7. Replace q&q with q:
(T|((q|T)&F)).

8. q|T will always be T because this operation means if either q or T is True, the result is True and T is always True, so replace (q|T) with T:

- ((y & T) & T) simplifies to y (from rule 2).

- On the other side, the (d | F|F) simplifies to d (from rule 5) and the ((d|d) & d) simplifies to d (from rule 1 and 2).

3. Now we can move on and look at the !!. Not a False value gives us True, so as a result of these inner parentheses, we simply have True.

4. Moving to the second set of parentheses. The first expression (F|((m|F)&F))|T simplifies as below:

Secondly, ""x | x"" (x OR x) is simply ""x"". The same goes for ""x & x"" (x AND x), which is also ""x"".

Using these principles, let's simplify the given formula.

Firstly, let's simplify all the arguments including False or True. ""F | F | F"" is simply ""F"", based on the principle explained above. So is ""F | c"".

Substitute ""F | c"" by ""c"", we get the following formula equivalent to the original one:

(((c|(c|F))|c)|((((((c&T)&c)|c)&(c|(F|c))))&c))

=> ((c|c)|c)|((((c&c)&c)|c)&c)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we must acknowledge that any statement OR False gives the statement (T|F => T) and any statement AND False gives False (T&F => F). Also, the negation of False (!F) gives True, and any statement OR True gives True (T|T => T, F|T => T). These are the basic rules of propositional logic we are going to use.

Let's simplify starting from the inner parenthesis.

1. ((F|(F|T)))
The result of F|T is already stated above as True, and hence F|True gives True as well. Thus, (F|(F|T)) = True.

2. (!F) is just True as any False expression inverted True.

3. (T|T) is also True as any True OR True is True as well. Therefore, ((t|((!F)&(T|T)))) will be either True OR True resulting in True.

Now, let's substitute to the original expression:

((!F)&((k|((True)&T))&(((True)&F)|F))). Now we have to apply the AND False rule above.

4. ((True)&F) = False, and anything OR False = that thing (in this case True). Therefore, (((True)&F)|F) = True.

Substitute again:

((!F)&((k|(True)&T))&True).

Now, anything AND True equals that thing. So, the expression simplifies to:

((!F)&((k|True)&T))

5. And we know that anything OR True equals True so (k|True) = True.

Hence,

1) (T & ((i & F) | (!T))):
