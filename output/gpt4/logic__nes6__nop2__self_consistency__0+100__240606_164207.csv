(T&F) is True and False which is False.

Substitute these values into the original equation, we get:

(((z|(False|False))|z)&(z&((z&True)|False))).

Simplified, it becomes
(((z|False)|z)&(z&z)).

(|) or operation with False does not change the other operand. Additionally, (&) and operation with True also does not change the other operand.
So this reduces to:
(z|z)&z.

(z|z) becomes z,
(z&z) becomes z.

The 'and' operation (&) is only True if both operands are True. Here z & False becomes False. And '(True & False) & True' also becomes False.

((u | u) & F) is F

The ""and"" operation with True also has no effect, so we simplify:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let’s simplify each of the components individually:

1. T&F = F (since TRUE and FALSE = FALSE)

3. F&F = F (since FALSE and FALSE = FALSE)
4. T&T&T = T (since TRUE and TRUE and TRUE = TRUE)

Now substitute these values  back into the equation, to get:

2. T & F is always F.

3. Now we can simplify (((T&T&F) | T)) into (F | T), which is always T. The not of T is F, so !(T) is F. The double negation reduces to a single positive, so !(!T) is T.

4. Now, since we have T instead of (x | T) | F, the expression becomes ((t & T & t) | F) which simplifies to (t & t) | F,  since any literal and True simplifies to the literal itself.

2. Hence, both '(!T)|T' and 'T|F' evaluate to True.
3. The inner bracket 'f|((!T)|T)' therefore simplifies to 'f|(F|T)' or just 'f|T', which always equals to True, because 'f' is always True or False and 'T' is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we deal with the true and false values given because their logic result will always be constant. 

- Anything OR True (e|T) will always be True because if either value is true, the whole expression is true. 
- Similarly, anything OR False (T|F or True|False) will always yield the value of the variable/element it's ORed with, because if the variable is true, the whole expression is true, and if the variable is false, the whole expression is false.
- Anything AND False (True|False)&F or (T&F), will always return False, because both values need to be true for the expression to be true.

- Not True (!T) will always give False because we're flipping the value.
- Not False (!F) will always give True because we're flipping the value.

So if we simplify those first.

1. (l|((((e|T)|F)|T)&F))|(F&(F|(!(T|(F|T))))) becomes (l|((((e|True)|False)|True)&False))|(False&(False|(!(True|(False|True))))).

2. Which simplifies into (l|((True|False)|True)&False)|(False&(False|(!((True|False))))).

3. Now the True and False values in the parentheses simplify: (l|(True)|False)&False)|(False&(False|((!True)))).
 
4. Which simplifies into: (l|True)&False)|False&(False|False)

5. (l|True) becomes True because anything OR true is true.

6. (!True) becomes False, because the ""not"" operator flips the value (True to False).

7. This gives us: (True&False)|(False&(False|False)). 

8. True&False becomes False because both values aren't true.

9. The whole second parentheses becomes False because all values in the ""or"" expression are false, and the result ""and"" False remains False.

10. So, we get False|False, which gives the final result as False, because neither of the values are true.

Also recall that the logical not operation flips a Boolean value from True to False or vice versa.

1. ""T & F"" and ""x & F"" both result in F, because in both cases True is associated with False using ""and"" operation.
Similarly, ""!T"" results in F, because we are flipping the value of T (True) to its opposite.

So, the expression simplifies to (((z & F) | (F)) | (T | T)) | (!F).

2. Any value & F simplifies to F because it means that the value ""and"" False, which is always False. Thus, ((T&T)&F) simplifies to F.
3. Again applying step 2, (((T&T)&F)|(T&((f&(f&(T|F)))&(j&((F&F)&F))))) simplifies to ((F)|(T&((F)&(j&(F))))).
4. Next, T|F simplifies to T because T means True and F means False. So True or False is True. This was already done but no such condition is there now.
5. Similarly, F&F simplifies to F because it means False and False, which is False.
6. Any operand & F is always F. Thus (F)&(j&(F)) simplifies to F and the whole expression becomes F|F.
7. Finally, the logical OR of F and F is False. Hence, the whole formula simplifies to F.

- Anything AND with False results in False (a & F = F)

Therefore, the first expression becomes (F & (q | T)).

Then we have (!((F | F) | T)) - the (F | F) simplifies to F and so this becomes !(F | T), which then becomes !T because anything OR true is true, thus this simplifies to False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, within the innermost parentheses, we have the expression ""T|F"", which means ""True OR False"". This will always be True. So it simplifies as:

   (((i|((i&T)|i))&i)&(!(T&(((h&h)&T)&F))))

2. ""h&h"" is equivalent to simply ""h"", because if ""h"" is true, the expression is true, and if ""h"" is false, the expression is false. So the expression:

   (((i|((i&T)|i))&i)&(!(T&((h&T)&F))))

3. ""(i&T)|i"", here ""i"" OR ""i and T"" will always equal ""i"", since if T is true, ""i"" is true, and if T is false, ""i"" is still true. So it simplifies as:

   (((i|i)&i)&(!((T&h)&F)))

4. ""i|i"" will always equal ""i"". Now, the expression is:

   ((i&i)&(!(T&h)&F))

5. ""i&i"" simplifies to ""i"". Now expression is:

   (i&(!(T&h)&F))

6. The expression ""(!(T&h))"" will result into not h, so the expression becomes:

   (i&(!h&F))

7. Here the expression ""!h&F"" will always be False, since False and any value always equal False. So the entire expression simplifies to:

- ""!T"" is F because not true is false.
- ""A & F"" or ""A | F"" is the same as ""A"" because anything AND false is false, anything OR false is the thing itself.
- A | A = A, what ever the value of A, its logical OR with itself is the same A.

Logical AND with True doesn't change the original value, so we can simplify (n&True) just as n. Logical AND with False always results in False, so we can simplify (v&False) as False. The formula now turns into 

(!((n|n)|(!False)))

Logically OR with itself doesn't change the original value, so we can simply (n|n) as n. And, logical NOT of False always results in True. Thus, the formula turns into

2. Now we simplify F|F. Logic OR operation requires at least one of its inputs to be True to become True. When both inputs are False, the result of OR operation is also False. So, if we replace F|F with F, we get (e&(T|(F&F))&(((!(!(!F)))&F)|F)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, using the logical and semantics (T&F is always false, T&T or F&T is always true), we can simplify the literals:

- T | T = T (since true OR true is always true)
- T & F = F (since true AND false is always false)
- F & T = F (since false AND true is always false)
- t & (F & T) = t & F = F (since any value AND false is always false)

Let us replace these in the original expression:

- ((T | T) & ((T & (!(T & F)) | F) | (T | ((t & (F & T)) & T))))
- ((T) & ((T & (!F) | F) | (T | F)))
  
Next, we'll use the rule of logical not semantics (!F = T):

- ((T) & ((T & T | F) | (T | F)))
  
By solving T & T = T and T | F = T, we can simplify this further:

- (T & (T | T))
 
Now using the rule where T or T = T and T and T = T, we get our final answer:

((g|g)&((((!(p&F))&T)|F)|(F|(x&((F&T)|F))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, `p&F` can be simplified to `F` because `F` in conjunction with any value `p` always equals `F` (False AND anything = False).
So `!(p&F)` becomes `!F` which then simplifies to `T` because `!` negates the value it precedes (not False = True).

Hence, `(((!(p&F))&T)|F)` simplifies to `((T&T)|F)` which further simplifies to `(T|F)`. Since `T|F`= `T` (because True OR False = True), the expression becomes `(g|g)&(T|F|(x&((F&T)|F)))`.

In this expression, `(F&T)` is always equal to `F`. So, `(x&(F&T)|F)` simplifies to `(x&F|F)`. As `x` and `F` always evaluates to `F`, the expression becomes `(g|g)&(T|F|F)`.

Finally, `(T|F|F) = T` (as `T` OR `F`= TRUE), hence the overall logical expression simplifies to:

`(g|g)&T`.

The expression `(g|g)` means `g` or `g` which simplifies down to just `g`.

So the final simplification is `g&T`.

This means that `g` must be true, and since `T` is always true, the overall expression is simply `g`.",g,g

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: T & F = F (since it's false that both T and F can be true at the same time)

So, ((y|(T&F))&T)|(T|((T&T)|T))) simplifies to ((y|F)&T)|(T|T).

Step 2: y | F = y (since false or anything is just that thing)

So, ((y|F)&T)|(T|T) simplifies to ((y)&T)|(T|T).

Step 3: ((y)&T)-> y&T (since taking y and T is just y&T)

So, ((y)&T)|(T|T) simplifies to (y&T)|(T|T).

Step 4: T|T = T (since true or anything is always true)

So, (y&T)|(T|T) simplifies to (y&T)|T.

Step 5: (y&T)|T can be rewritten as T|(y&T) (since OR operation is commutative i.e, A | B = B | A)

Step 6: T|(y&T) = T (law of domination in logical OR-operation: true OR anything is always true)

So, !(((y|(T&F))&T)|(T|((T&T)|T))) simplifies to !T.

Step 7: !(T|T) simplifies to !T (since true or anything is always true)

So, ((!(y|(T&F))&T)|(T|((T&T)|T)))|(!T) simplifies to !T | !T.

Step 8: !T | !T will simplify to !T (since false or anything is always that thing)

So, ((!(((y|(T&F))&T)|(T|((T&T)|T))))|(!(T|T))) simplifies to !T.",!T,F

3. Any expression ""or"" T = T, because T (true) always makes an ""or"" expression true.
4. !T = F, because it negates the truth.

So, replacing in the logic formula:
