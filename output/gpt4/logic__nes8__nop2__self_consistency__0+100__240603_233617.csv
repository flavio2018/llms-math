A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that some of these combinations are immediately clear:

- F & (l|T) is equivalent to F & T, because (l|T) is always True. And F & T is False.
- F|T is equal to True, because if either side of an OR is True, the whole thing is True.
- m|m is equal to m, because any value OR'd with itself just remains the same.

So with this in mind, simplify from inside out:

- F|T within ((F|(k|T)) is True, so (F|(k|T)) simplifies to T.
- ((m|F) within ((m|F)&((m&m)|(m|F))) is m, because m OR False is m. So ((m|F)&((m&m)|(m|F))) simplifies to ((m)&(m)).
- Also m&m is m, hence morphs to m. Therefore ((((m|F)&((m&m)|(m|F)))|T)) simplifies to m.

Next, (n&n) is clearly just n. Also, (T|F) is simply True and (T&F) is False. So it becomes:

((g&(((n|n)&True)&False))&(n&F))

4. (!T)|((!((u|(u|u))|T))|((!(T|(r|T)))|T)) simplifies to F|F|T which is True because there is a True in an OR operator.

5. Now, looking at the other side of the OR operator, (b&(b|b)) we can simplify (b|b) to b which reduces the expression to b&b which is simply b.

Now our statement becomes:

Next we can simplify (z&F) as F, thus making our equation:

Now, (!F | T) can be replaced by T because:
- If (!F) is T, then T | T = T
- If (!F) is F, then F | T = T

2) (z&z): This will be equivalent to z.

4) (T|F): This is always True as T=True, because OR requires one condition to be True.
5) (F|T): Similarly, this is also True as T=True, because OR requires one condition to be True.
6) (T&F): This is False as it requires BOTH statements to be True. Since F is False, this indicates the statement overall is False.
7) (k&(F&T)): This also ends up being False because the statement (F&T) is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's resolve inner operations:

1. F&T is False because it requires both operands to be True, but F is always False.
2. (y|F) simplifies to y because False or anything always results in the other operand.
3. ((y|y)|((y&T)&(F|T))) simplifies as well, let's solve it in steps:
    a. (y|y) is just y.
    b. (F|T) is always True because one of the operands is True.
    c. (y&T) doesn't simplify further. Let's denote it as X.
    d. So, the whole operation becomes (y|X), which doesn't go further either for now.
4. (!(!F)) is True because negating False results into True and the second negation turns True into False again.

So, the simplified version after the first step looks like this:
(y&((y|y|X)|True|F)).

In this version, we can simplify further:

5. (y|y|X) doesn't simplify because all operands can be either True or False.

1. Anything OR'd with False (A|F) is the original value A.
2. Anything AND'd with False (A&F) is always False, because both parts of the AND operation need to be true to be true. If any is false, the result is false.

So, ""n OR F"" just gives us ""n"", and ""False AND any value"" gives us ""False"". 
This leads us to: 
n & (((n | (n & n)) & n) | (F | ((j & F) | T))) & (F & T).

But notice that ""any value AND True"" gives us the original value.
Hence, ""(n & n)"" gives us ""n"" again, and ""(j & F) | T"" gives us ""F | T"", which is always ""T"" (since anything OR'd with True is always True)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","This is a long Boolean expression, but we can simplify it using the properties of Boolean logic.

1. First, the expression (T|F) will always be True (T) since the logical OR operation returns True when at least one of its inputs is True.

3. The expression ((!F)&T)|F becomes F|F by substituting the values we have figured out so far. The logical OR operation with both inputs as False results in False.

- Now, since any variable ANDed with False becomes False (i.e., x&F == F), further simplification yields:

- From (F&F) we get a F again, so the formula simplifies into:

Knowing that h&h => h since anything AND itself is equal to itself, then we further simplify to:
h|(d|T).

d|T also simplifies to T since anything OR True is always True, giving:
h|T.

So the equation simplifies to:

As (!T) is False and ((F&(T))|F) is True, ths will simplify to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify T|F, T&T, and any instances where we see l&l or l|l.
- T|F = T (True OR False = True)
- T&T = T (True AND True = True)
- l&l = l (anything AND itself remains the same)
- l|l = l (anything OR itself remains the same)

Replacing these in our given expression, we get:

l|(l&T)|(l&((l&l)&(l&(T)&l)&(l&l)&T)).

Since l&T = l (as anything AND True remains the same), and also l&l = l and l&T = l as established before, we further simplify the expression:

l|l|l

This simplifies to l. 

So the simplest form of the given expression is l.",l,l

((T|(F|F))|(F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T)))|(!(F&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the constants in the formula. 

- `F|F` is False
- `T|(F|F)` is True
- `F&T` is False
- `T&F` is False
- `T|T` is True
- `F&F` is False

So, the simplified formula becomes:

`((T|F)|((F&T)|(T|T)))` or `((T|F)|False)|(True|True))`.

The further simplification will result in: 

`T|False|True` which is `True`. 

Therefore, the formula simplifies to True, regardless of the truth values of `g` and `p`.",T,T

(!((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to simplify boolean constants like ""T"", ""F"",  ""!T"",  ""!F"", and ""F|F""  ""T|F"", ""F&T""  ""T&T"".  
   Here:
    - ""T"" stands for True 
    - ""F"" stands for False 
    - ""!T"" stands for Not True i.e., False
    - ""!F"" stands for Not False i.e., True
    - ""F|F"" stands for False OR False which is False
    - ""T|F"" and ""F|T"" stand for True OR False which is True
    - ""F&T"" and ""T&F"" stands for False AND True which is False
    - ""T&T"" stands for True AND True which is True

Given is 

    (!((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F))))

Replacing the known values, we get

    (!((o|True) & ((False & (s & (False|False))) | ((False & (!((False | True) & False))) & False))))
    
Further simplifying, we get

    (!((o | True) & ((False & s & False) | (False & (!True) & False))))
    
        = (!((o | True) & (False | (False & False))))
        
        = (!((True) & (False)))
        
        =  !(False)
    
So, this simplifies to ""True"".",True,T
