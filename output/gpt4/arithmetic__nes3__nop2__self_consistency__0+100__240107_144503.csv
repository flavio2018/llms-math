77 * 42 = 3234. Because this number is positive, calculate 3234 modulo 100, which gives us 34.

Next, calculate 38 * -8 = -304. Because this number is negative, calculate -304 modulo -100, which gives us -4.

Secondly, calculate the subtraction expressions inside the brackets:

6 - 74 = -68. Because this number is negative, calculate -68 modulo -100, which gives us -68.

Now, subtract -4 from -46. This gives us -42. Because this number is negative, calculate -42 modulo -100, which gives us -42.
