2. In addition, (T&T)&T simplifies to True. Therefore, our expression comes to:

3. The statement (!(!T)) is simply stating not not True, which of course is True. Hence, this addition simplifies the statement to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that T and F represent True and False values. Also, the expression F&T or False & True will always be False because both operands for '&' (logical AND) must be true for the result to be true. 

Therefore, let's start by simplifying the innermost expression:
F&T is F (or False)
!F is T (or True)

So, (((((c&c)|c)|c)|c)|((!F|T)))) simplifies to c|T, because !F is T and any expression OR True will always be True.

On the other hand, !(!F) is equivalent to True. 

Therefore, the logic from your expression can be written as ((x&x|x)&x|(T)), because you can always reduce ((x | (x&x)) | x) to x since 'x AND x' will always be x and 'x OR x' will also always be x.

Finally, Your logic formula simplify as follows (((x&x|x)&x|(T))) = T, because any expression OR True will always be True. So, your entire logic formula is always True regardless of the values of c and x.",T,x

3. Anything OR'd with T is always T, putting this logic, formula becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","There are several static truth values in the statement that can be simplified. (T|T) always yields True, (F&F) always yields False, and (T&T) always yields True, and we also know (t|T) and any (x&T) will be T.

Also worth noting is that a double negation (!!) cancels out, and thus any double not symbol (!!) can be removed without changing the expression.

Here are simplification steps:

1. Simplify the innermost constant expressions and double negations. The original expression becomes:

((T|(T&T))&(T&T&((!(!(F)))&(!(j&F))|(!T))) 

2. Apply the known true / false results again:

(T&T) = T

(!F) = T

(T|T) = T

(!T) = F  

This simplifies the expression to:

(T&T&(T&(!(j&F)))&F)

3. And (j&F) would return F if j is F and would return j if j is F. But we don't know the value of j, in both cases the NOT operation would result in the truth value is true or j:

(T&T&(T&T)

This simplifies ((T & (((s|s) | s) & F)) | F) to False.
And (u & F) to False.

So, our expression becomes: 

((z & (F | False)) | (T & (T & (! (w | (s | (T | False)))))))

This simplifies to: 

((z & F) | (T & (! (w | (s | T)))))

Since the tour ""AND False"" is equivalent to False, we can simplify the statement to: 

False | (T & (! (w | (s | T))))

""False OR x"" is equivalent to x. Therefore, our expression simplifies to: 

T & (! (w | (s | T)))

Simplify w | (s | T) to True because anything OR True will be True.

Our expression simplifies to: 

T & (! True)

The not operator reverses the logical state of its operand. So ! True is equivalent to False. Hence,

2. Any literal `and` with True (l&T) simplifies to the value of the literal itself (l).
3. Logical not of True (!T) is False (F) and logical not of False (!F) is True (T).
4. Any literal `or` with False (l|F) simply equals the literal itself (l).
5. Any literal `and` with False (l&F) equals False (F).
6. (F&F) will be False (F).

Applying these rules to your formula:

(((!(((((((((l&l)|(l&T))|l)|F)&(l|(l|(F&F))))|T)|F)&T)|(!(((!T)|T)&F))))) becomes:


(((!(((((((((l)|(l))|l)|F)&(l|(l|F)))|T)|F)&T)|(!(F&F)))).


Then it simplifies to:


(((!(((((((l|l)|l)&(l|l))|T)&T)|(!(F)))).


Notice that (l|l) simplifies to l and (F) simplifies to False.

Therefore:

((!(((((l)&(l))|T)&T)|!(F))).


The expression (((l)&(l)) simplifies to l. And (!F) simplifies to True.

So, your formula further simplifies to:

((!(((l|T)&T)|T))).

And (l|T) simplifies to True, so the formula simplifies to:

Similarly, (F&F)|T & F equates to F | F which simplifies to F because for the OR operation to be True, at least one side must be true.

Finally, F & (T & (i & F)) equates to F because again, for AND operation both sides need to be true.

Thus, let's substitute these simplifications into the expression,

Step 2: The logical AND operation ""&"" with ""F"" always returns ""F"", so ""(F&(!(((p&p)&T)|T)|F))"" equals ""F"". Also ""p&p"" is ""p"" since an element Logical ANDed with itself is itself.

Step 3: The formula simplifies to ""n | F"". The logical OR operation ""|"", with the element ""F"", equals to the other element. Therefore, the formula simplifies to ""n"".

When (F | T) is calculated, you get True (T), since just one of the inputs needs to be True for the overall OR operation to be True.

(T & !(!F)), F represents False, therefore it simplifies to (T & !(True)) = (T& F) = False (F)

Because of AND’ing with False, the whole block becomes False ((F&T) = F)).

Now let's look at the broader expression: (t & (F | T)), with OR it doesn't matter if the one value is False if the other one is True and so, this simplifies to (t & T) and, since True AND-ed with something doesn't change its value, this further simplifies to just t.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we notice that (F&T) always results in False, so any expression involving (F&T) can be replaced by False. We also know that F&F results in False and F|F results in False. 

Therefore, we can simplify the formula to ((!(d&((!((e&e)&F))&F)&(((T&F)|F))))|(!(!F))). 

Secondly, we know that (e&e) equals to e. Also, (!(!F)) is equivalent to T. We also can simplify (((T&F)|F)) to F. 

Hence, the formula becomes ((!(d&((!e&F)&F)&F))|T). 

Thirdly, ((!e&F)&F equals to F. 

Hence, the formula now looks like this: ((!(d&F&F))|T).

Finally, d&F&F equals to F. 

So, the formula simplifies to (!F)|T, which simplifies further to T. 

So, the final simplified form of the formula is T.",T,T

(((((T|(F|((F|((F&F)&(F&T)))|((T&F)|T))))&T)|(!(T|(T|(!T)))))&F)&((F&F)|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: 
Let’s focus on the sub-expressions like F&F, F&T, T&F, etc. Note that logically,
- F&F = F (False & False = False)
- F&T = F (False & True = False as anything ""and"" False is False)
- T&F = F (True & False = False as anything ""and"" False is False)
- T&T = T (True & True = True)

Replacing these values, the expression simplifies to:

(((T|(F|(F&F)|((T&F)|T)))&T)|(!(T|(T|!T)))&F)&((F&F)|T)

Step 2: 
Next, consider the sub-expressions with the | operator and remember that anything ""or"" with False is itself and anything ""or"" with True is True

- F|F = F (False | False = False)
- T|F = T (True | False = True)
- F|T = T (False | True = True)

Applying these replacements, we get:

((T|F|F|T)&T)|(!(T|T|!T))&F)&T

Step 3:
Let's simplify further 

- T|T = T (True | True = True)
- !T = F ( not T = False)
- T|!T = T (True | not True = True)
- F&Anything = F (False & any Boolean value = False)

((T& T)|(!(T))&F)&T = ((T)|F&F)&T = T&T = T 

So, logically the given expression simplifies to ""T"" or True.",T,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that !T is F (not true is false), and !F is T (not false is true). 

So the original formula becomes: 

((((((((F)&((F&T)&T))))&(F&T))|F)&(r|(T|T)))|F)&T)|(p&((F&T)&F))).

Also, (False & Anything) = F. So, that whole part of F&T simplifies to False too.

(((((((F)&F))|F)&(r|(T|T)))|F)&T)|(p&F)).

We also know, r|(T|T) simplifies to T because (Anything | True) = True.

So, our formula is now:

((F|F)&T) or (p&F).

Finally, (False | False) = False and (Anything & False) also equals False. 

Our final simplified formula is thus:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the innermost brackets:
Notice that anything AND False (F) is False, so we have (F&F&F) = F
Again within brackets noticing that anything OR False is that thing itself so we have (F|F) = F
Also, notice that NOT of False is True, so we have !F = T

Now we substitute these results into the formula:
(!((F|(T&((F&F)&T))&T))|(F|(T|(F|(!T))))
= ((!((F|(T&F&T))|T))|(F|T))

The AND operator has a higher precedence than the OR operator So simplify (T&F&T) which results in F:
= (!((F|F&T)|T))|(F|T)
= (!((F|F)&T)|(F|T))

Again, notice that anything AND False (F) is False, so we have (F&F) = F
= (!((F&F)&T)|(F|T))
= (!((F&T)|(F|T)))
= (!((F&T)|T))
= ((!F&T)|T)

   - (T & T) -> True(T)
   - (F & F) -> False(F)
   - (T | F) -> True(T)

   So the formula can be simplified to:

   (!(T&((!(k&(x&F)))& F)))&((T&((!(!T|F))&T))&T)

2. Then, deal with the logical not(!):

   - !T -> False(F)
   - !F -> True(T)

   The formula can be simplified further to:

   (!(T&F&F))&((T&((!F)&T))&T)

3. Since anything ANDed with False returns False, and anything ANDed with True stays unchanged:

   The formula can be simplified further to:

Further simplifications yields:

Now, let's simplify the F & T part. It is False, F, because the logical and "" & "" operation returns True only if both values are True. Here, one value is False, so the result is False.

(((((j|(!T))&T)&((((j&T)&((((o|F)|(T&F))|F)|(T|(v|T))))&j)|j))&j)|((j&T)&j)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The ! operator will negate the value. So, (!T) will be F (false) and (!F) will be T (true). 
Therefore, the formula simplifies the following way:
(((((j|F)&T)&((((j&T)&(((o|F)|F)|(T|(v|T))))&j)|j))&j)|((j&T)&j)).

The | operator means logical OR. j|F will be either T or F, depending on what value j has (j or F). Similarly, o|F will be either T or F, depending on what value o has (o or F). 
So, our formula now becomes:
(((((j)&T)&((((j&T)&(((o)|F)|(T|(v|T))))&j)|j))&j)|((j&T)&j)).

Also, any value ANDed with True (&T) doesn't change that value. Similarly, ORed with False (|F) doesn't change. So:
(((j&(((j&T)&(o|F|(v|T)))&j)|j)&j)|((j&T)&j)).

Then substitute again: o|F -> o and v|T -> T:
(((j&(((j&T)&(o|T))&j)|j)&j)|((j&T)&j)).

Also, any value ORed with True (|T) gives True:
(((j&((j&T)&T)&j)|j)&j)|((j&T)&j)).

We have j&T -> j and (j&T)&T -> j:
(((j&j&j)|j)&j)|(j&j) -> ((j|j)&j)|j -> (j&j)|j -> j|j -> j.

((((l&(((w&((T&(False))|T))&w)|(!(F|(F&((T|F)|T))))))&l)&T)&(l|(F|(j&(v&F))))).

T&False gives False. F&any value gives False. So the remaining terms and parentheses can be simplified to:
((((l&(((w&(False|T))&w)|(!(F|(False)))))&l)&T)&(l|(F|(j&(False))))).

False|T gives True. W&True gives W. F|False results in False. So the remaining terms simplify to:
((((l&((w&w)|(!False)))&l)&T)&(l|j&False)).

w&w is just w. Not False (or !False) is True. j&False results in False. So the remaining expression simplifies to:
((((l&(w|True))&l)&T)&(l|False)).

w|True is always True. So the remaining expression simplifies to:
((l&True)&l)&T.

l & True equals l; so we finally get:
(l&l)&T.

Again, l&l equals l; so we get:

2. Now, notice !T is always F. So, ""T&T"" and ""F&T"" are T and F respectively. Also, ""T|T"" is T and ""n|T"" is T.

3. Dealing with ""!"", ""T&F"" is always F. So, ""!F"" is T. Then, we get:

- F|F is false as false OR false always results in false.

((((h&(h|(T&F)))|h)|(((h|((F|(y|(s|T)))|F)&F))&h)&T)&(h|h)).
Further principle of logic are:
- h|(h|ANYTHING) is the same as h|h which is just h because anything OR with itself is itself.
- T&ANYTHING is the same as ANYTHING because true AND with anything just gives that thing.
- F&ANYTHING is false because false AND with anything is always false.
So now, the simplified formula is:

Further simplification will give:

Notably, {something | T} will always result T, because whatever the value of 'something' is, it can only be True or False, and in either case, T win the operation.

Logical and & can be seen as the multiplication in binary, but more straight-forward, if both operand are true, the operation will result true. However, importantly, if any operand is false, the operation will result false. This means {something & F} is always F, because whatever the value of 'something' is, it can only be True or False, and in either case, F win the operation.

We can replace !T into F, v|T into T, w|w into w, T&F into F, r|T into T, F&F into F. After these simplifications, the expression becomes:

(F&((!(!T))&((((((w&((w&w)&T))&T)|(F)|F)|(F))&F)&F))).

Again, we can replace !T into F, T&F into F, w&w into w. After these simplifications, the expression becomes:

(F&(F&((((((w&w)&T)|F)|F)&F)&F))).

The expression has become much more simple, but we can notice F&{anything} will always result F, no matter what is 'anything'. Therefore, all other things become irrelevant when anded with F. 

Using this fact, we finally reach the most simplified version:

4. The negation of False is True (!F = T) and vice versa. Further simplifying, we get: (!((!(True))&F)&((!True)&F)).

- T|ANYTHING has the value T, regardless of the truth value of the second operand, while
- F|F has the value F.

Moreover, & (And) and ! (Not) have these basic rules:
- T&ANYTHING has the value of the second operand,
- F&ANYTHING equals F, regardless of the second operand, because 'and' needs both conditions to be true,
- and !!ANYTHING gives us back the original truth value (only if we use classical logic, due to the law of double negation).

Let's apply these to our formula in order of operations (inside parentheses and from left to right):
• !F|F simplifies to !F|F = F, which gets us T|(k&F&F)|(!w|!!s|F) & T & (F|u&F)
• !F|F simplifies to F again, which gets us T| False & F | !w | T | F & T & F | False

- T|F is always equal to True, so replace these with ""T"".
- F&T is always equal to False, so replace these with ""F"".
- !F is True and !T is False, because the ""!"" operator negates the Boolean value.

So now the formula becomes:
(s|F)&((!F|T)|(T&F)|T).

Still we have some operations with T and F:
- s|F is 's', because something OR False remains as something. 
- !F gives us T, as not False is True.
- T&T is always equal to True, from the properties of AND.

Change the formula into:
s&((T|T)|T|T).

Here, (T|T) is True or True will always result in True.

3. (F|T) simplifies to T (False OR True is True).

The formula becomes: (h&((h|((((((h&F)&h)|h)|h)&h)&(z|(h|T)))&(m|T)))&T). 

The ""!"" before (T|F) negates it, so it becomes False:

(h&((h|((((((h&F)&h)|h)|False)&h)&(z|(h|T)))&(m|T)))&T).

The part ""False & h"" is False and ""False | h"" simplifies to ""h"". Similarly, the part ""m|T"" and ""h|T""  will be True because True OR anything is always True.

!(!((((((T)&T)&(!((F|(!(!F)))&T)))&T)&(s|(F|T))))).

Step 5: T AND T is True. The expression becomes:
!(!((T&(!((F|(!(!F)))&T))&(s|(F|T)))).

Step 6: (!(!F)) is equal to F based on Double Negation law, so the expression becomes:
!(!((T&(!((F|(F))&T))&(s|(F|T)))).

Step 7: F OR F is False. The expression becomes:
!(!((T&(!((False)&T))&(s|(F|T)))). 

Step 8: False AND with any T gives False. The expression is:
!(!((T&(!(False))&(s|(F|T)))).

Step 9: NOT False is True, so the expression becomes:
!(!((T&(True)&(s|(F|T))))).

Step 10: T AND True is just T. So, the expression is:
!(!((T&(s|(F|T))))).

Step 11: F OR T is True, so the expression is:
!(!((T&(s|T)))).

Step 12: Anything OR-ed with True is True, so the expression is:
!(!((T&T))),

Step 13: Now, T and T is T, so the expression becomes:
!(!(T)),

Step 14: NOT T is False. So, the expression is:
!((False)),

Step 15: Finally, NOT False is True. So the expression is:
(T).

- (((F&(!(F|F)))|T)|((!(f|(m|T)))&T)) = ((F | T) | F) = T
- (p & T) = p

- (p & (p & T)) = p

2. So:
- ""x & (F|F)"" will simplify to ""x & F"", because ""F OR F"" is False. This further simplifies to F, because anything AND False is False.
- ""T | F"" will simplify to T because ""True OR False"" is True.

4. There is also ""T|F"" and ""d|F"", both of which simplify to T and d respectively, since True OR anything is True, and anything OR False is the same thing.

5. Thus, introduce the simplifications into the original expression, it becomes ""!((v & v) | ((((T | F) | T | F) | d)))"". Further simplifications yield ""!(v | (T | T | d))"" which simplifies to ""!(v | T | d)"" and since T OR anything is True, the expression simplifies further to ""!T"".

2. Now, our new equation will be ((o|(o|((F&(F|(F)))|(w&F)))|F))|(((f&T)&f)|T)|F)&F).
3. Repeat the step 1 to further simplify the equation:
