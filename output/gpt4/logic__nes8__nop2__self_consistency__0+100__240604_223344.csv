A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Anything OR True is always True. So, (F|(k|T)) = T, and (m|F) = m, and (l|T) = T.
2. And also, False AND anything is always False. So, (F & T) = F.
3. Anything in conjunction with itself remains itself. so, (m & m) is m.
4. Anything OR False is just itself, and anything AND True is that thing itself. We can replace terms accordingly.
5. Lets substitute these values.

The expression simplifies as follows:

So our statement becomes:
((g&(((n|((n&(n|F))|((T&F)))&(T|F))&(T&F)))&((n|F)&F)).

Next, anything AND False (A&F) is False. So, (T&F), (T|F) become F and T. 

Our statement becomes:
((g&(((n|((n&(n|F))|F)&T)&F))&(n|F)&F).

Again, anything OR False (A|F) is just A, so n|F simplifies to n. 

Our statement becomes:
((g&(((n|((n&n)|F)&T)&F))&n&F).

As noticed before, anything AND False (A&F) is False, so our statement simplifies to:
((g&((n|F)&T)&F)&F).

((g&(n&T)&F)&F).

We keep utilizing the same two logic rules. So, our statement becomes

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. A logic OR operation involving False simply returns the other operand. So, all the (f|F) parts simply become f. The term ((f&T)|(F&T)) simplifies to (f|F) as anything AND True is itself and anything AND False is False.

2. A logical AND operation involving True simply returns the other operand. So, all the (f&f) parts simply become f, the (f&T) parts become f, and the (F&T) part becomes F. 

3. The ! operator flips the value of the operand. So, !(F) turns into T (True). 

4. A logical AND operation involving False returns False, so if the formula contains  any part of this form: ""f&F"" or ""F&f"", you can omit this part, because it always returns False.

5. A logical OR operation involving True returns True, so if there exists any part ""f|T"", ""|T"" can be removed.

The expression inside the inner parentheses is ((F&F)&(T|T)).
""T | T"" simplifies to ""T""
""F & F"" simplifies to ""F""

Step 2: Apply NOT (the ""!"" operator) to above result
So, we apply NOT to F, to get the next expression. Hence, the NOT of F is T.

Step 3: Simplify (k | (T & (!F)))
The ""!F"" in this expression becomes T.
Then (T&T) simplifies to T.
Then ""k | T"" gets simplified to T, since anything OR True is always True.

Step 4: Apply NOT (the ""!"" operator) to the whole expression

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We know that False & (anything) = False, because an AND statement is only True when both conditions are True. This means we can simplify (F&T) to F. Let's replace this in our expression, giving us (y|F).

2. Also, the OR operation will always be True as long as one of the conditions is True. This means we can simplify (y|F) to y. The expression now reads: (y&(...)).

3. An OR condition that is the same statement (i.e. (y|y)) is the same as just y, because if y is True or False, the OR condition is still the same as y. Let's replace these in our expression, resulting in: (y&((y|((y|F)|(y&T)))|(!(!F))).

4. (F&anything) = F and (T&anything) = anything, so (y&T) remains the same. We have already shown that (y|F) can be reduced to y, so our expression then becomes: (y&((y|y)|(!(!F)))). 

5. The Double Negation Law states that anything NOT NOT anything is just anything because the double negative flips the boolean value twice, rendering the effect of the NOTs useless. So, (!(!F)) is just F. Additionally, anything OR False is just anything. Therefore, the whole expression can simply be: (y&(y|F)).

6. As discussed earlier, (y|F) = y, so our final simplified statement is: (y&y)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's analyze the more complex expressions within the outermost brackets.

1. (n|F) & n = n
    - This is true because any letter or logical value (in this case, n), OR-ed with False, is simply that letter or logical value. In other words, if n is True, the result is True; if n is False, the result is False. And-ing this with n does not change the value of n.

2. (j & (F & !F)) = F
   - This is true because False AND-ed with any value always gives False.

3. (F|((j&(F&(!F)))|T)) = T
   - We just found out that the expression within the brackets evaluates to False. Hence, it does not matter what False is OR-ed with (here, j&F), because the result will still be False. This makes the expression turn into (F|T), which results in True, because any value OR-ed with True gives True.

4. ((n&((((n|((n|F)&n))&n)|F)|(F|((j&(F&(!F)))|T)))) = n
   - This is because the complex expression simplifies to n & T, which results in n since anything AND-ed with True gives that thing itself.

5. ((F&T)&T) = F 
   - This is because anything AND-ed with False gives False

The next step is to keep in mind that NOT T is F, and NOT F is T. Let's substitute:

((!(F|(T&T)|F))&(T|(F|T)))

Any expression AND-ed with T is the same thing (because T is the identity element for the logical AND operation), so we get:

(!T&T)

So, it simplifies to -

3. Using the rule where anything OR-ed with False stays the same, we get -

Remembering that the symbol & has the semantics of logical AND and the symbol | has the semantics of logical OR, then any expression of the form ""T & P"" or ""F | P"" can be simplified to ""P"". 
Additionally, any expression of the form ""T | P"" or ""F & P"" can be simplified to ""T"" and ""F"" respectively.

The entire expression thus simplifies to (y | (y & True))| (y | (p & False)).
We will again simplify the above expression by simplifying the expression ""(y & True)"" to ""y"" and ""(p & False)"" to ""F"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we have logical operators in the brackets. According to logic semantics, (o|F) = o, (F&F) = F, (T&F) = F, (F|F) = F because ""F"" or False is an identity for ""or"" and a nullity for ""and"". So, let's simplify according to these rules:

= (s|(((o|F)&F)&F)&T)&T)|(!((T&((F|F)&F))|F))&F)|(!F)

= (s|F&T)&T)|(!F&F)|(!F)
= (s|F)&T)|(!F)
= s&T|(!F)

Now let's also simplify ""T"" and ""!"" symbols. According to logic semantics, !F = T, and ""T"" (True) is an identity for ""and"". So, let's apply these rules:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, using the fact that T|F = T and T&T = T, we simplify the formula to:

Then, we use the fact that a|T = T and !T = F, also we know that anything and True (h&T) remains itself (i.e., equals h), giving:

(!(!((((h&T)&h)&T)|(d|(!F))))).

This simplifies as:

(!(!((h&h)|(d|T)))).

We know that anything or True (d|T) equals True. Also, h & h equals h (because the same value and itself returns itself). So, we can simplify above equation as:

(!(!(h|T))).

So, anything or True equals True, yielding:

(!(!T)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First off F|T looks straightforward - it immediately simplifies to T (since anything OR True is True).
Replacing this concept throughout, we get the formula as:
(T & (v | ((!(!T&F)))&F) & (F | (e & (F &((F&(!F))|F))))).

Negation of False is True, and Negation of True is False. So, !(T & F) immediately simplifies to (!T | !F) = (F | T) = T
So, the formula becomes: 
(T & (v | (T & F) & (F | e & F & (F& F | F)))))(1)

Next, (T & F) simplifies to F, so the formula is now:
(T & (v | F & (F | e & F & (F | F)))).

Then, (F | e & F & F) simplifies to F as F & anything will always be false. So, the formula reduces to:

- The right side of the whole formula ""((F|(F&T))&T)"" simplifies to F. Because ""False and anything"" is F, ""False or anything"" is always that ""anything"". In this case, the ""anything"" is F, so ""F or F"" is F.
- ""T and F"" is F.
- ""F or F"" is F.

Thus, (((T&(T|(!F)))&((F|(F&T))&T))|F) simplifies to F.

So the entire formula simplifies to ((m|F)&F) = (m&F), because ""m or F"" is always the truth value of m as ""m or False"" equals m, and ""m and F"" is F as ""anything and False"" is always F.

In this case, the whole logic formula simplifies to F.",F,m

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any logical operation with False, no matter logical and (&) or logical or (|), doesn't affect the result. So, (F|T)=T and (((T&F)|(T&F))&T)=F.
2. Therefore, F|(F|T)=F|T=T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, (T|F) can be simplified to T since True or False is always True.

Let's look at parts (l&l). These can be simplified to just l, as something and something is always just that something. At the same time, (l|(l&T)) can be simplified to l, as something or something and True will still just be that something. (T&T) is also obviously just T.
 
Then, turn our attention to the part that now looks like this: (l&((l&l)&(((l&T)&(T))&((l&l)&T)))). Dropping out the unnecessary brackets and simplifying l&l and T&T again, it is transformed into (l&(l&l&(l&T))) which further simplifies into (l&l) and thus just l.

Overall the final expression simplifies into l.",l,l

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, remember that T is True, F is False, | is logical ""or"", & is logical ""and"" and ! is logical ""not"".

1. (F|F) - this will result in False, since both values are False.
2. (T|(F|F)) will become (T|F), which will result in True, because T or F is always True.
3. (p&F) and (T&F) - these will both result in False, because anything and False is False.
4. (g&F) - this will result in False, because again anything and False is False.
5. (! (F&T)) will become (!F) because F&T is always False. !F will result in True, because it's not False.
6. (F & ((T & False) | True) | True) - remember this's what the second part of our formula became after simplifying - will become (F& (False | True) | True), which will become (F & True | True), which will finally become (F | True), which is always True.
7. The whole formula will then become (True | True), which will result in True.

So, the output of this logical formula is True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the T and F symbols represent True and False respectively. Therefore, we can simplify the whole statement according to the rules of the logical operations:

1. For logical 'or' operation, any literal 'or' True will always give True. False 'or' True will also give True. Meanwhile, any literal 'and' False will always give False. 

2. For logical 'not' operation, not True will give False. Not False will give True. 

Using these rules, we can start simplifying the expression:

(!((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F)))) 

=>(!((o|T)&((F&s&F)|((F&(!F))&F))))
