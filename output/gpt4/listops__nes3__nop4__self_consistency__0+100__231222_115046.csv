= [SM 4 [MIN 7 2 2 6] [MAX 7 9 1 [SM 6 4 7 7]] 1] 

Now, let's find out the results of maximum and minimum operations:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we handle the inner brackets by using the semantics of SM, MAX and MIN operators.
We start by solving the MAX 5 9 2 5 expression. According to the MAX operator's semantics, it returns the maximum integer within the list. The maximum integer from the list is 9.

So, it becomes MAX 9 [SM 9 3 9 9] [SM [SM 3 7 0 9] 8 [MIN 7 1 6 2] 4] 7.

Similarly, the values for MAX 5 0 9 7 and MIN 7 1 6 2 are 9 and 1, respectively.

We end up with MAX 9 [SM 9 3 9 9] [SM [SM 3 7 0 9] 8 1 4] 7.

Next, let's solve the SM operator in inner brackets. The SM operator sums up the totality of numbers on a list and then the result is modulo 10.

So, SM 9 3 9 9 equals [(9 + 3 + 9 + 9) MOD 10] = [30 MOD 10] = 0.

The equation now is MAX 9 0 [SM [SM 3 7 0 9] 8 1 4] 7.

For the remaining SM operator, SM 3 7 0 9 equals (3 + 7 + 0 + 9) MOD 10 = [19 MOD 10] = 9.

Therefore, we get MAX 9 0 [SM 9 8 1 4] 7.

The SM operator then evaluates SM 9 8 1 4 as (9 + 8 + 1 + 4) Mod 10 = [22 MOD 10] = 2.

So, the expression becomes MAX 9 0 2 7. 

Finally, applying the MAX operator to this results in 9 since 9 would be the maximum value of the integers 9, 0, 2, and 7.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, recognize the deepest embeddings brackets and carry out their operations:

[SM 5 3 8 8] = (5 + 3 + 8 + 8) modulo 10 = 24 modulo 10 = 4

[SM 5 7 8 2] = (5 + 7 + 8 + 2) modulo 10 = 22 modulo 10 = 2

[MIN 2 6 2 9] = minimum of (2, 6, 2, 9) = 2

[MAX 5 8 0 0] = maximum of (5, 8, 0, 0) = 8

The expression now is simpler:
[MIN 1 [MAX 3 4 4 2] [MIN 2 3 5 8] 1]

Then, performing the MAX and MIN operations inside the brackets:

[MAX 3 4 4 2] = maximum of (3, 4, 4, 2) = 4

[MIN 2 3 5 8] = minimum of (2, 3, 5, 8) = 2

Further simplification yields:
[MIN 1 4 2 1]

Finally, taking the minimum of (1, 4, 2, 1) gives us 1.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, evaluate the inner-most functions.

- [MIN 7 9 2 7] = 2 since minimum of these numbers is 2.
- [MAX 3 0 9 4] = 9 since maximum of these numbers is 9.
- [MAX 1 3 1 2] = 3 since maximum of these numbers is 3.
- [MIN 8 9 0 1] = 0 since minimum of these numbers is 0.

So after first step, the expression will look like this:
- [MAX 2 [SM 8 2 0 9] 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

Now, calculate sum modulo 10.
- [SM 8 2 0 9] = (8 + 2 + 0 + 9) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9. 

So the expression will be:
- [MAX 2 9 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

Now, calculate the maximum again.
- [MAX 5 3 1 0] = 5.

So the expression will be:
- [MAX 2 9 1 5].

Lastly, find the maximum of these numbers:
- [MAX 2 9 1 5] = 9.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, MAX will give the maximum value in a list. So, [MAX 9 2 5 9]=9, [MAX 3 0 7 5]=7, [MAX 7 9 9 9]=9 and [MAX 5 6 1 5]=6. 

So, the expression will be: 

[SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1].

Now, the SM operator sums the numbers and if the result is over 10, return the modulo of 10. 

[SM 4 9 6 7]= 26 so, 26 modulo 10 = 6. 

Now, the expression will be: 

SM [6] 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1]. 

Let's do the MIN operation now: MIN will gives the minimum value in a list. So, [MIN 9 7 6 1]=1.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we'll solve the expressions inside the square brackets:

[ MAX 9 2 4 6 ] gives the maximum among 9, 2, 4, 6 which is 9

[ MAX 8 2 4 0 ] gives the maximum among 8, 2, 4, 0 which is 8

[ SM 0 6 5 7 ] gives the sum of 0, 6, 5, 7 modulo 10, which is (0+6+5+7)mod10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

[ MIN 8 9 1 6 ] gives the minimum among 8, 9, 1, 6 which is 1

Substituting these results in the main expression gives:

[ SM 2 7 8 1 ] gives the sum of 2, 7, 8, 1 modulo 10, which is (2+7+8+1)mod10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

Substituting these results in the main expression gives:

- [MIN 1 4 8 9]: The smallest number in this list is 1.
- [MAX 7 9 [MIN 0 7 5 0] [SM 3 1 1 4]]: Before we find the maximum, we need to evaluate the inner expressions under this operation:
