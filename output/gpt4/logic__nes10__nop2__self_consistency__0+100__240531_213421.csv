A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the statements (F&T), (!(!(!T))), (j|j), and (F&F) simplify to F, T, j, and F respectively. 

With these simplifications, the given formula becomes:

(i|(i|F))&(!(F|(T&(!u&j)))). 

Furthermore, the statements (i|F) and (T&(!u&j)) simplify to i and (!u&j) respectively. 

Substitute those to the formula results in:

i&(!(F|(!u&j)))

Now, the statement (F|(!u&j)) simplifies to (!u&j). Substituting it back to the formula:

i&(!(!u&j)). 

Finally, De Morgan's laws suggest that we transform the !(!u&j) into the equivalent (u| !j). 

So, the simplified logic formula is:

2. Simplify (((x|x)|x)|x)) and (((c|c)|c)|c), it will both be x and c respectively because any value OR the same value is that value itself.
3. Simplify !(F&T), it will be T because False AND any value is False and negation of False is True.
4. Simplify (!T|T), it will be T because negation of True is False and False OR True is True.
5. Simplify !(F&!T), it will be T because negation of False is True and True AND any value is True. Consequently, negation of that result is False.
6. Simplify (x&T), it will be x because any value AND True is that value itself.

((F | T) corresponds to true since anything OR true is true.
((!F) corresponds to true.

Again,
((c&(c&T)) gives us C since anything AND true is itself. 
(f&(F|F)) gives us false, since anything AND false is false. 

Then, simplifying the formula again we have # (!((T|T)|c)|(false|T)&(true)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, starting from left to right:

- (T | (T & (T | T))) simplifies to T because T or anything is always T.

- (!(!(F&F))) simplifies to (!(T)) or F because F & F is always F, and not F is T. Thus, not T is F.

- (!(T & (!(j&F)))) simplifies to F because T & anything is True, but not j&F. This is always either True as well when j is True or False when j is False, hence the whole statement is never False. Thus, not T or F.

- (!(t|T)) simplifies to F because t or T is always T, and not T is F.

- First, let's simplify (s|s)|s into just s. So, (T&((s|s)|s) is simplified to T&s. But keep in mind, anything ANDed with False (F) becomes False. So, T&s&F becomes F.
- Second, anything ORed with False (F) remains as is. So, (s&F)|F becomes F, and T&F and F|F becomes F as well. The whole clause ((F|(((T&(((s|s)|s)&F))|F)&T))|F) simplifies to F. So, z&F turns to F.
- In the other part, any clause ORed with True (T) simplifies to True. So, w|(s|(T|((u&F)|F)) simplifies to True. The NOT operator flips True to False, so, !(w|(s|(T|((u&F)|F))) simplifies to F.
- Also, anything ANDed with False (F) becomes False. So, T&F becomes F and T&(T&F) simplifies to F.
- Final step, anything ORed with False (F) remains as is. So, z&F or T&F simplifies to F or F which finally results to F.

4. Likewise, `(F&(T&(i&F)))` equals `F & T & F` or `F` (any statement and false equals false).
5. Hence, `((F&F)|T)&F` equals `(F | T) & F` equals `T & F` or `F` (true and false equals false).
6. Therefore, `((m&T)&((((F&F)|T)&F)|(F&(T&(i&F)))))` equals `(m&T) & (F | F)` which equals `(m&T) & F` or `F` (any statement and false equals false).

5. (F&(T|(F|((!T)|(!T)))))) is the next subexpression, where (!T) can be F. Hence we have F&(T|(F|(F|F))).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T | (any_expression) simplifies to T (since True or anything is always True). T & (any_expression) simplifies to (any_expression) (since True and anything just takes the value of the second expression).
2. F | (any_expression) simplifies to (any_expression) (since False or anything just takes the value of the second expression). F & (any_expression) simplifies to F (since False and any expression is always False).
3. !T | (any_expression) simplifies to !T | (T | (!T)). The expression (T | (!T)) is a Tautology (always True), hence !T | (Tautology) simplifies to T, because ""Not True or Anything"" is always True.
4. !(any_expression) has the opposite value of (any_expression).

With these guidelines in mind, we can start simplifying your formula:

Original: (((((T|(F|((F|((F&F)&(F&T)))|((T&F)|T))))&T)|(!(T|(T|(!T)))))&F)&((F&F)|T))

- Step 1: The part (F|((F&F)&(F&T))) simplifies to F, because anything ANDed with False becomes False and then False ORed with False remains False.
- Step 2: This leads to ((T|(F|F&F))&T), which further simplifies to (T&T)=T, because anything ORed with False simply takes on the value of the first expression and T&T = T.
- Step 3: !(T|(T|(!T))) simplifies to !(T), because T ORed with anything becomes T and not T is F.
- Step 4: ((T&F)&((F&F)|T)) simplifies to (T&F) & T, because (F&F) | T simply becomes T, and then this simplifies to F & T = F, because anything ANDed with False becomes False.

So, the entire complex formula simplifies to F.",F,F

Performing the simplification:

Leads to:
((False&r) & T) = (r&T)

Further simplification yields:

((r&T)|F)&T) = ((r AND T) OR False) AND T

It simplifies to (r&T)&T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, we simplify the inner most brackets first. In this logic equation, (F|F) is similar to saying False OR False which will remain False.

2. Now replace (F|F) with False. The equation becomes 
!((F|(T&((False)&((F&(F&(T&F)))&(!(((False)&T))))&T)))|(F|(T|(F|(!T)))))

3. Here, (False & T) is similar to saying False AND True which turns into False. 
4. Also, (T&F) can be simplified down to False. 

After substituting in those results, we get:
!((F|(T&((False)&((F&(F&False))&(!False))&T)))|(F|(T|(F|(!T)))))

5. The simplified equation further simplifies to:

!((F|(T&((False)&((F&False)&True)&T)))|(F|(T|(F|(!T)))))

6. Here, (False&((F&False)&True)&T) can be simplified to False as AND operator with False results in False.

The simplified equation is now:

!((F|(T&False))|(F|(T|(F|(!T)))))

7. The expression (T&False) simplifies to False, while the expression (!T) simplifies to False. Also, False OR False OR False becomes False. Therefore, the equation further simplifies to:

8. As F OR False simplifies to F, equation simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any Boolean operation ""and"" (&) with False (F) will result in False regardless of the other value. Therefore, the statement (T&F) can be substituted with F. Similarly, (T&F) is F.
2. Any Boolean operation ""or"" (|) with True (T) will result in True regardless of the other value. Hence, wherever T|anything or anything|T is found, it can be simply replaced with T. So, (T|F), (y|T), ((T|F)|T), (((T&F)|T)|F) etc. are all T.
3. Negation (!) of False (F) is True (T). So, !(F) and !(F&) can be replaced by T. 
4. And (&T) is not changing the value that is next to it.
5. Similarly, |T will become just T.

With all these simplifications, the formula becomes:

(F&(T&(F&(F))) which simplifies even further to F.

3. The not operator `!` inverts the truth value of a Boolean, since `F` stands for False and `T` for True, we can simplify `!F` to `T` and `!T` to `F`.

4. In an AND statement, `True` and `True` is `True`. Hence `(T&T)` simplifies to `T`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, break down the innermost expressions that can be simplified:

1. T&F becomes F (since both values have to be true in ""and"", but one of them is false)
2. T&F&T turns to T (irrespective of any number of T, if there's a F, the result will be F)
3. ((T|F)|T) turns to T (either one of the values is true, result is true)
4. F&T simplifies to F (both values have to be true in ""and"", but one of them is false)
5. F|F reduces to F (since both being false, output in ""or"" will be also false)

So far, we get:
((((l&(((w&((T&F)|T))&w)|!(F|F))))&l)&T)&(l|(F|(j&(v&F))))).

Now simplify further:

6. T&F is F (both values have to be true in ""and"", but one of them is false)
7. w&F simplifies to F (for ""and"" both values have to be true)
8. W&F&W reduces to F (regardless of any number of T, if there's an F, the result will be F)
9. Being not F i.e. !F becomes T
10. As we have T in both parts of ""or"" i.e. F|T becomes T

Now we have:
((((l&T)&l)&T)&(l|(F|(j&F)))).

Then look at the remaining operations:

11. L&T turns into L (if L is true then output is true, else output is false)
12. L&L simplifies to L 
13. F|F reduces to F (since both are false, result in ""or"" will also be false)
14. J&F is F (since in ""and"", if one value is false, the result will be false)
15. F|F including remaining ""or"" results in F

Finally, you get:

((!((T&(T|((T|(F|((T&T)|T)))&(!(T|(!(F|T)))))))&(F&((!T)&T))))&(n|(!F))

1. Simplify the embedded values:
   
   (T|F) simplifies to T (since T or anything is always T).
   
   (T|T) also simplifies to T.

   (F|T) simplifies to T (since True or False is always True).
   
   (!T) simplifies to F (since it is negation of T).
   
   (F&T) simplifies to F (since False and anything is always False).

   (!F) simplifies to T (since it is the negation of False)

Thus, the formula becomes: 

((!((T&(T|((T|T)&(!T))))&F))&(n|T)).

2. Let's simplify further:

   (^)(T|T) simplifies to T.
   
   (T&(!T)) simplifies to F (since T and F is always False).
   
   (T&F) simplifies to F.
   
   (!(T&F)) simplifies to !(F) which is T (as !F is T).

2. Next, look at ((j&((j|F)|j))|F). Here, 'F' stands for False and anything ORed with False stays the same. So, this simplifies to (j&(j|j)) which is j.
3. Now, look at v&(l&((a|F)&(F&T))). Here, (F&T) simplifies to False (Anything ANDed with False gives False). So, this now becomes v&(l&(a&F)), which also simplifies to F as anything ANDed with False gives False.
4. Therefore, (!F) becomes T (since '!' stands for logical NOT, and NOT False is True).
5. So, w|((!F)|(!F)) simplifies to w|T|T, which simplifies to T.

Further simplify:
(h&h) = h (a variable and itself is always itself)
(h|h) = h (a variable or itself is always itself)
(h|F) = h (a variable or false is always the variable)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, look for constant values. We have a few instances of 'F & anything' and 'T | anything'. We know that 'F & anything' is always False, and 'T | anything' is always True.

Next, in the expression, you can see 'F&(!F)'. This is basically False, as we're doing an AND operation with False and Negation of False which is True.

So, the expression simplified becomes:

(((((T&(!((T|(F))|T)))|F)&F)&T)|(F&(!((!((T|((k|(T))|T))&F))|F))).

After that, 'F' in '|(F)' can be simplified to 'False' again. And notice, 'T | False' simplifies to 'T'. 

This leads to: 

(((((T&(!((T)))))|F)&F)&T)|(F&(!((!((T|((k|(T)|T))&F))|F))).

'F' in 'F&!' and 'F' in '&F' can be simplified to 'False' again. Also 'T | False' simplifies to 'T'. All 'T' in the expression simplifies to 'True':

((((T&(!T))|F)&F)&T)|(F&(!((!(T|k|T&F))|F))).

'(!T)' in 'T&(!T)' is 'Not True' that means 'False'. And 'T and False' becomes 'False'

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can consider the logical operations with values True or False (T or F). Here, we remember:

- The 'and' (&) operation with False (F) gives F, unless both sides are T then it gives T. So, X&F or F&X = F, and X&T or T&X = X.
- The 'or' (|) operation with True (T) gives T. So, X|T equals T.
- The logical 'not' (!) on False (F) gives True (T), and vice versa. So, !F = T and !T = F.

After considering these, we can simplify the logic as follows:

1. Start to simplify from inner brackets towards outer brackets.
2. The first inner bracket is (s&F)- This is F

(!T) gives us ""F""
(!F) gives us ""T""

Additionally, any expression in the form of ""F & something"" gives us ""F"", because ""falsy"" and anything is always ""falsy"". Similarly, any expression in the form of ""T | something"" gives us ""T"", because ""truthy"" or anything is always ""truthy"":

(F&(!T)) is equivalent to (F&F) which gives us ""F""
(F|(m&F)) is equivalent to (F|F) which gives us ""F""
(T|(F&m)) is equivalent to (T|F) which gives us ""T""

Replacing those expressions in our original formula results in:

!(((x|(((k|F)|k)|(!(n&(p&(!F|T))))))&T)|(F|T))

Next, we should consider ""!"" operator again, now it applies to more complex expressions:

!((n&(p&(!F|T)))) is equivalent to: !((n&(p&(!F|T))))
because (!F|T) is always T, so this expression becomes: !(n&p&T), according to DeMorgan's theorem, a negation of a conjunctive proposition is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations, so this  is equivalent to: !n | !p | !T

Therefore, the simplified form of !(n&(p&(!F|T))) is !n | !p | F which simplifies to !n | !p as False OR anything is just ""anything"".

Substituting these values back in our main formula we get:

We can combine ""k|k"" to ""k"".

The formula is now
!(((x|(k|(!n | !p)))&T)|(F|T)).

This can be simplified to
!(((x|k|!n | !p)&T)|T)).

Because anything AND True is just ""anything"", we can omit ""&T"" to get
!((x|k|!n | !p)|T)).

Anything OR True is always True, so this simplifies further to

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The first thing to note is that the !T transforms into F. So, our expression becomes ((F&((!(!(v|T)))&((((((w&((w|w)&T))&T)|((T&(F&(r|T)))|F))|(F&F))&F)&F))).

2. Further, ANY value or True logically OR-ed will always be True, therefore we can simplify v|T becoming T. Then our expression becomes ((F&((!(!T)&((((((w&((w|w)&T))&T)|((T&(F&(r|T)))|F))|(F&F))&F)&F)))).

3) Any value logical AND with False (F) will result in False (F). 
4) Double negations (!!) cancel out.

Using these logic rules, we can simplify the formula as follows:

(T|(!(h|T))) is T, and (((q&T)&T)|T) is T. Also, (u|T) is T.

So the formula becomes:

Next, take care of double negations and simplify:

This gives us ((F|T)&F) and the ((T)&F) which further simplifies to (T&F).

1. Start with the innermost brackets, and fold outwards.
2. Use the following facts: 
   T or anything = T, F or anything = anything, T and anything = anything, F and anything = F, not(T) = F, not(F) = T

4. Simplify F&(any_expression). ""False AND any_expression"" is always ""False"". This is because, in logical 'and', the output is true only when both operand are true. So, if one operand is False, the output will definitely be False.

5. Simplify !T and !F. ""!True"" is ""False"" and ""!False"" is ""True"". Not operation simply makes the original boolean value its opposite.

7. x & True & x => x, according to idempotent law (A & A = A).
8. F & F => False, as anything AND False is always False.

Also, (!F) returns True and False ANDed with anything (T or F) returns False, i.e. ((!F)&F) is False. Also, anything ORed with False remains same, i.e. (!F) is True.

In addition, True ANDed with anything simply returns the same value, i.e. T&(!(!F)) means T&True which is simply T.
