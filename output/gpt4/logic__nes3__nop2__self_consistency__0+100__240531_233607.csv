Next, (w&w) will always equal ""w"" because any variable and-ed with itself will always equal itself. So the formula simplifies down to (w|w)|f, which is much simpler.

However, any variable ""or-ed"" with itself ((w|w) in the case of our formula) will also always equal itself. This simplifies the formula down even further to w|F.

Finally, w|F will always equal ""w"".

(((n&n)&n)|((s&s)&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","A: Firstly, any value and-ed with False (F) results in False, so ((s&s)&F) simplifies to F.
Secondly, any value and-ed with itself does not change the value. So, (n&n)&n simplifies to n. 
Therefore, the original logic formula simplifies to n|F. 
Finally, any value or-ed with False is just the value itself. So, n|F simplifies to n.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (!F) represents not False, which is True.
The expression (F|T) represents False or True, which is True.
So the expression ((!F)|(F|T)) can be simplified to (True | True), which is True.

Next, the expression (T&F) represents True and False, which is False.

Therefore, the overall expression simplifies to (True & False), which gives you False. So, the simplified formula is F.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that 
!T is equal to F because not true is false.
T & T equals to T because true and true is true.
T & F equals to F because true and false is false.

So the expression can be reformulated as follows:
((F)|(T))|(F).

Next, in the context of logic operations, F (False) or T (True) equals T (True). This can be represented as:
(T)|(F).

Finally, T (True) or F (False) equals T (True). 

So, the simplified value of (((!T)|(T&T))|(T&F)) is T or True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, T&T is T (True AND True is always True)

Now, the formula looks like ((c|F)|((c|F)&T))

Then, (c|F)&T is (c|F) because anything AND True is the same thing.

Now, the formula looks like ((c|F)|(c|F))

Finally, (c|F) OR (c|F) is same as (c|F) because anything OR itself is the same thing.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, (y|y|y) simplifies to y because ""or""-ing a value with itself does not change the value.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify (T&T) as this is simply True. 

So, the formula becomes ((i&True)&((i&T)&i)).

Then, logic operation i&True is the same as i itself, as 'and' operation with True doesn't change the value. 

Now, the formula becomes (i&((i&T)&i)).

Similarly, (i&T) also simplifies to i, making the expression now (i&(i&i)).

Finally, 'and' operation i&i returns i, so the final simplified formula is (i&i) which further simplifies to i.",i,i

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1.  Logical AND operation for any variable with itself will result in the same variable: so (c&c) becomes c

- !F is equivalent to T, 
- T&T is also equivalent to T.
