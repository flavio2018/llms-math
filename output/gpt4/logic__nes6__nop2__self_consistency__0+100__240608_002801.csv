Which then simplifies to:

(((z)|z)&(z&(z&T))).

Note, ""z|(z)"" gets simplified to ""z"", and ""(z&T)"" gets simplified to ""z"" because T is True and ""anything AND True"" is ""anything"". Therefore, we are left with:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1:
On the left hand side (LHS) of the formula, we have (F | (F | (!F))). 

Here, F | F is F because false OR false is false, and (!F) gives T. So, (F | (!F)) simplifies to (F | T) 

Then, F | T is T, since false OR true is true. So, simplifying even further, the LHS becomes T.

Step 2:
On the right hand side (RHS), we have (T | (n & ((!T) | (F & F & F))))).

On the RHS, (!T) is F because the negation of true is false and F & F & F is F because false AND false AND false is false. 

This leads to (T | (n & (F | F))), which simplifies to (T | (n & F)).

As false AND anything is false, (n & F) becomes F. So, (T | F) simplifies to T, since true OR false is true.

'n&(n&True)' gives us 'n&n', which is simply 'n', and 'n&T' simplifies also to 'n'.

""i AND T"" will always return i, because AND operation returns T only when both its operands are T.

Now, let's break down the given formula:

Firstly, simplify ""(i|i)"" to ""i"".

Secondly, simplify ""(i|T)"" in the second part of the formula to ""T"".

Thirdly, simplify ""(k|T)"" to ""T"".

Then, simplify ""(i&T)"" to ""i"".

Reason: Because True & False = False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice any expression ""& T"" or ""| F"" doesn't change the value of the expression. It's like multiplying by 1 or adding 0 in arithmetic. 

Second, an expression combined with ""& F"" or ""| T"" always equates to F or T, respectively. This is similar to multiplying by 0 or adding infinity in arithmetic.

Also, anything OR'd with itself remains itself, much like ""X + X = X"".

Applying these rules:

(((r & r) & T) & (((((r & T) | F) | ((T & T) & F)) | (F | F)) | r))

Simplifies to:

2) Some value AND True gives that value.
3) Some value AND False gives False.
4) Some value OR True gives True.
5) Some value OR False gives that value.

Now, let's start simplifying:

Step 1 : Simplify !T and !F in formula:
    = (a&F) | ¬((F & F) & F & w&F)
    = (a&F) | ¬(F & F & w&F)
   
Step 2 : (F & F) gives F

Step 3 : Again (F & F) gives F
    = (a&F) | ¬F

Step 4 : Any value AND F gives F, (a&F) gives F
    = F | ¬F

Step 5 : F or ¬F is a tautology that is always True

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that any value OR with False equals to the value itself which means F|T is equal to True, and any value AND with True also equals to the value itself which indicates T&T is equal to True. Also negation of True (!T) is False and False AND with any value is always equals to False. 

So we can simplify the given expression to:

((T&(T|((!T)&T))) | (F&(T&(F&F))).

Which reduces further to:

((T&(T|F)) | (F&(T&F)).

Now, any value AND with True equals to the value itself and also any value OR with False equals to the value itself. Negation of False (!F) is True and True AND any value is always equals to the value itself.

Our expression then simplifies to:

(T|F).

T|F simplifies to True because any value OR with True is always True. By substituting the values, we get T for the whole expression. Thus, the simplified form of given expression is: T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the innermost expressions:

T | T = T (true OR true is always true)

T & F = F (true AND false is always false)

F & T = F (false AND true is also always false)

t & F = F (literal AND false is always false)

Next, you can simplify the expressions where you have true AND something else:

!(T & F) = !(F) = T (NOT false is always true)

T & T = T (true AND true is always true).

Finally, the whole expression can be simplified as follows:

(T & ((T & T) | T)) = T & T = T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that anything OR'd with itself is just equal to that thing. Hence, g|g simplifies to g.

Next, note that anything AND'd with False is always False. So, (p&F) simplifies to F.

We also know that the NOT of False is True. So, !(p&F) simplifies to !F, which is T.

Therefore, the expression (((!(p&F))&T)|F) simplifies to (T&T)|F, which further simplifies to T|F. The value of T|F is always True, so the whole expression simplifies to T.

Applying the same logic, we see that (F&T)|F simplifies to F|F, which in turn simplifies to F.

Hence, x&((F&T)|F) simplifies to x&F, which is always F because anything AND'd with False is False.

So, the whole expression F|(x&((F&T)|F)) simplifies to F|F, which is False.

Finally, let's put everything together. Our original expression ((g|g)&((((!(p&F))&T)|F)|(F|(x&((F&T)|F))))) simplifies to (g&T)|F, which further simplifies to g|F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify T&F to F since both values need to be true for the overall statement to be true. So the formula becomes:
((!(((y|F)&T)|(T|((T&T)|T))))|(!(T|T))).

Then, applying the identity law T&T = T and eliminate the parentheses, becomes:
((!(((y|F)&T)|(T|T))))|(!(T))).

Again, y or F is always y, and T or T is always T, this can further simplify to:
((!((y&T)|T)))|(!T).

The not operator (denoted by '!') will make !T = F. So we have:
((!((y&T)|T)))|F.

And since notting (""!"") everything inside the brackets changes their value, we have:
(!(y&T & !T))|F.

But (y&T & !T) is always False, hence this can further simplify to:
(!F)|F.

Use demorgen's law - the complement of a conjunction is the disjunction of the complements and so you get:
(!y & !T & T)|F = (False & False & True)|False = False|False.

The final simplification is the logical or operation (denoted by '|'), where F or F is always False. The final result accordingly is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, any condition or term operated with False by using an AND operator is False, as something is only True in AND operation if both are True. Thus (T&F) simplifies to F, so our formula now looks like:
((v&(v|F))&(n&(F&(((!T)|T)|((d|T)|F))))).

Secondly, any condition or term operated with True by using an OR operator results in True. This happens because something is True in OR operation if at least one item is True. Thus (d|T) simplifies to T, so the formula now looks like:
((v&(v|F))&(n&(F&(((!T)|T)|T)))).

Next, any condition negated twice will fall back to its original state. As T is True, !T will be False and !!T will be True. Thus (!T) simplifies to F, so the formula now looks like:
((v&(v|F))&(n&(F&((F|T)|T)))).

Now we know from the second step that any condition or term operated with True by using an OR operator results in True. We can apply this rule to both (F|T) and its result with T which simplifies to T and T, so the formula now looks like:
((v&(v|F))&(n&(F&T))).

Again applying the first rule, we know that any condition or term operated with False by using AND operator is False. Thus (F&T) simplifies to F and the formula now looks like:
((v&(v|F))&(n&F)).

Again applying the first rule, we know that anything operated with F using an AND operator results in False. Thus (n&F) simplifies to F and the formula now looks like:

Next, focus on the expression ((((!F)|F)&F)&F)). This can be simplified to (T&F&F), which will be False, because a logical AND with False is always False.

These substitutions simplify the initial expression to ((b|F)&(T)). An Or operation with True also always results in True, so we can simplify this further to T.

The result of (w&T) will be T only if w is T. Because T&T equals T and F&T equals F.

The expression ((((w&T)&T)|w)|F) simplifies to w.

Next, consider the formula `u & T`. This returns the value of u, as anything and True is the value itself. Thus, the formula simplifies further to:

(((u&u)&T)&((u&(!F))|u))&(u&u)

Consider the formula `u & (!F)`. The not False equates to True, making this equivalent to `u & T` and hence simplifies to u. The formula continues to coincide:

((u&T)&(u|u))&(u&u)

The value of `u|u` is u, so:

((u&T)&u)&(u&u)

(c|(c|((c&c)|c))). Since 'c&c' is true whenever 'c' is true, so 'c&c' can be simplified to 'c'. So that part reduces to (c|(c|(c|c)))), and given an 'or' operation is true if at least one of the operands is true, this whole section simplifies to 'c'.

For Part 2: 
We know that 'e&F' is always False (since 'F' is False and 'and' operation is true only when both operands are true). So 'T&(e&F)' simplifies to 'T&F'.
