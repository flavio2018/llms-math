A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The statement ""T&T"" is always True, because it says both are True. So, we can simplify ""T&T"" to T.
2. The statement ""T|T"" is always True, because it says at least one is True. So, we can simplify ""T|T"" to T.
3. The statement ""!T&F"" is always False, because it says True and False together makes False. So, we can simplify ""!T&F"" to F.
4. For a or operation where one value is always True, the result is always True. Therefore, ""<any_boolean>|T"" or ""T|<any_boolean>"", we can simplify it to T.
5. For a and operation where one value is always True, the other value effects the result. Therefore, ""<any_boolean>&T"" or ""T&<any_boolean>"", we can simplify it to <any_boolean>.
6. For a or operation where both values are same. The result is same as the values. Therefore, ""<any_boolean>|<any_boolean>"" is always <any_boolean>.
7. For a and operation where one value is always False, the result is always False. Therefore, ""<any_boolean>&F"" or ""F&<any_boolean>"", we can simplify it to F.

After those simplifications, we end up with ""m&(m|((i|F)&F))"". Then we continue as follows:

8. The statement ""i|F"" is equal to i, because or operation with one False value reduces to the other value. So, we can simplify ""i|F"" to i.
9. And at last, the expression ""(i&F)"" is always False. So, the whole expression can be simplified to ""m&F"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first thing to note is that `F|(!F)` can be simplified to `T` because it means False OR Not False (True), which must be True. The same simplification can be made for `T&F`, which means True AND False, which must be False. 

So the formula can be simplified to:

(((j|(!((F|T)&T)))&j)|(((((j&((F|T)|(F&F))&w)&j)|j)|F)|j))

Next, `F|T` simplifies to `T` (because it means False OR True, which must be True) and `T&T` simplifies to `T` (because it means True AND True, which must be True). Also, `F&F` means False AND False, which must be False.

So the formula simplifies to:

(((j|(!(T&T)))&j)|((((j&((T)|(F))&w)&j)|j)|F)|j))

Again, `T&T` simplifies to `T`, and `T|F` simplifies to `T`.

So we have:

(((j|(!T))&j)|(((j&(T&w)&j)|j)|F)|j))

Then, `!T` is `False`, so `j|!T` simplifies down to `j`.

The formula now becomes:

((j&j)|(((j&(T&w)&j)|j)|F)|j))

Also note that `j&j` is just `j` and `j&(T&w)&j` is `j&j&w`, which simplifies as `j&w`.

So the formula is now:

(j|((j&w|j)|F)|j)

The subformula `(j&w|j)|F` indicates that you either have `j&w` or `j` or False. This simplifies down to `j` because if `j&w` is true, then `j` must be true; if `j` is true, then it's true; and False doesn't change the fact that if `j` is true, then it's true.

The formula is now:

(j|j|j)

The OR operator `|` is idempotent, which means that `j|j|j` simplifies down to just `j`.

So, the final simplified formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The part inside the parenthesis can be simplified as follows:

1. Any value logical and with False (value & F) is always False. 
2. Any value logical or with False (value | F) is always the value itself. 
3. Any value logical or with True (value | T) is always True. 
4. Any value logical and with True (value & T) is always the value itself. 

The logical not operator (!) will just negate the value (True to False, False to True). 

Using these rules, we can simplify as follows:

1. !((k|((k&(k|F))&((((t|(F&(j|(T|F))))&t)&(F|((F&((F&T)&T))|T)))|T)))|(F|(T|F)))

2. This simplifies to !((k|((k&k)&(((t|j)&t)&T))|T))

3. Which simplifies to !((k|(k&(((t|j)&t)&T))|T))

4. Since anything logical and with True is itself, we get (!((k|k|T)))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, simplify within brackets and replace: 
   a) F&something = F and 
   b) T&something = something and
   c) T|something = T and
   d) F|something = something.

The simplified expression after this step for ""((s|((T|(!F))&((w&F)&T)))|T)"" becomes ""T"". The part ""((T|(!F))&((w&F)&T))"" gets simplified to ""F"" so the whole expression ""((s|F)&T)"" simplifies to ""T"".

Similarly, ""g&(s&&(F&(a|T)))"" which simplifies to ""g&(s&F)"" = ""g&F"" = ""F"". The part ""(y|(g&(s&(F&(a|T)))))"" simplifies to ""(y|F)"" = ""y"".

So the expression ""((y|(g&(s&(F&(a|T)))))&y)"" simplifies to ""y&y"" = ""y"".

After simplifying these parts, the given expression becomes: “((y|F)&(y|y)&y)” = ""y&y&y"" = ""y"" as logical and is idempotent law.

2. Any value AND'd with False (x&F) gives False (F). So z&F gets simplified to F.
3. Anything OR'd with True (x|T) gives True (T). So T|(F&(F&(T&T))) simplifies to T.
4. Any value AND'd with itself (x&x) gives the original value (x). So (i&i) simplifies to i.

    - F | F = F
    - !(F) = T (since negation (!) of false (F) is true (T))

3. ""v | F"" is again simplifies to ""v"".
4. Inside the brackets with a lot of ANDs ""&"" anything that is ANDed with False will be False, and similar anything ORd with True will be True: ""f&F"" is ""F"", ""z|T"" is ""T"", ""T&(!T)"" is ""F"", ""F|T"" is ""T"", and ""T|(T|(T|(r&r)|T)))"" is ""T"".

3. An expression ""w & w"" is always the same as ""w"", so (w&w) equals to w.

4. Anything OR True (T) is True, and anything AND True (T) is simply the same as that ""anything"". For example, w|T = T, and T&w = w, for any boolean w. So, we simplify the second part of the logic formula. The expression (w|(((w|(((w&w)|w)|w))&w)|F)) simplifies down to ""w | T"", which equals ""T"". 

5. So finally, we have that the whole formula simplifies to (F) | !(T & T), where ""T & T"" becomes T, so ""!(T & T)"" becomes F. Therefore, the initial formula simplifies to (F | F), which equals to F (False).",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we notice that operation with True (T) and False (F) can be simplified immediately:

2) For the OR operation (|), anything OR True will be True, and anything OR False will be the original value. So, '(d|T)' will be True.
3) Logical NOT (!) operation flips the final result so that True becomes False and vice versa. Therefore '!T' will be False and '!F' will be True.
4) ('F|F') will be False

Applying these simplifications, we can rewrite the formula as:

(T&(((c|(!(T&F)))|F)|(F|(!(F|(j&((!F)|F)&(True)))))))|False.

Again we can simplify this as:

(T&((c|True)|F) | (F | (!F|(j&F&True)))) | False

(T&True) | (False | True) | False.

The result of each part is:

Looking deeper, an OR operation between a letter and itself (e.g., u|u or w|w) will always just simplify to that letter (u or w).
Likewise, an AND operation (using &) between any letter (say x) and False (F) will always be False (i.e. x&F = F) any letter OR False will be just the letter (i.e., x|F = x).

4. There is an expression ((F&(!F))&(!(a|T)))&F , which contains both !F and F, hence that is a contradiction and is considered false. 
5. Drilling down inside it, the innermost expression (a|T) is a or True, which is always True. Its negation is then always False. So, F&False&F & False results to False.

However, condensing (~(!(o|T))|F) first, as anything OR with true is true, the expression anything OR with T gives T, so we have o|T. Similarly, NOT(NOT(Boolean value)) gives you its boolean value, so NOT(NOT(T)) gives True.

Next, consider the expression (q|(T|T)), anything OR true gives you T. Therefore, the condensed form becomes True OR T which gives T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) First of all, notice that (!T) is equivalent to False and (T|(!T)) is equivalent to True since the negation of True is False and True OR not True is always True.

2) Also, (F&F) is False, ""something & False"" is False and ""something | False"" is ""something"".

3) (((F&F)&T)&(((T|(!T))|((n|F)&F))|F)) simplifies to F.

4) Thus, the whole complex expression u|((!T)&((((F&F)&T)&(((T|(!T))|((n|F)&F))|F))|(F|F)) simplifies to u|F, which is just u.

5) Take a look at the other part of the original expression: (!(d&F)) is equivalent to (!d | !F). Since !F is True, this is equivalent to (!d | True) which is always True.

6) (T&(!(!(d&F)))) simplifies to (T & True) which is just T.

7) So, the whole expression (((((u|((!T)&((((F&F)&T)&(((T|(!T))|((n|F)&F))|F))|(F|F))))|F)|u)|(T&(!(!(d&F)))) simplifies to (u | T), which will be always True (because either u is True or T is always True).",T,u

Then, (o|o) and (y|T) is o and T respectively.

We can further simplify ((o&F) and ((T&F)&T) and ((r|T)&T) to False, True and True respectively.

Given the expression:
((a&(T&(((F&(F|T))&T)|T)))|(!(((a&(((!(!(F|(T|T))))&(T|(!((T&T)|F))))|T))&a)&F))

F&(F|T) simplifies to F
(T&T) simplifies to T
!((T&T)|F) simplifies to F
(T|F) simplifies to T 

Thus we are left with ((a&(T&T))|(!(a&T)&F)), which simplifies further to ((a&T)|(!a&F)).

However, ""&F"" always returns F and ""T|"" always returns T, within the Basic Logic Laws.

2. In a logical 'AND' operation, if one of the operands is false, the result is also false. This means that for any literal 'P', (P&F) evaluates to 'F'. Hence, expressions such as ((k|k)&F), (q&F), (u&F), (!F)&u, and (s&T)&F become F, F, F, u, and F, respectively.

3. In a logical 'NOT' operation, a false value becomes true. This means that for the literal 'F', !F evaluates to 'T'. 

4. In a logical 'OR' operation, if one of the operands is true, the result is also true. This means that for any literal 'P', (P|T) and (T|P) evaluate to 'T'. Hence, expressions such as (T|((!F)|((s&T)|(T|T)))), (T|u), and (u|T) become T, T, and T, respectively.

5. (((!True)|F)) simplifies to True. Since (!True) equals False, and False or anything equals that thing, this simplifies to False|F, which is False.

Now, replace all these values into the formula.

(!((n&n)&(((e|(F|((F&(F&T))|T)))&((((!((q&F)&((!T)|(T|F))))|F)|F)|F))&(!T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We can simplify things which have negation (!) first. 

   `(F&T)` is always False, as False and anything is False. So, `(F&(F&T))` is always False. 

   `(F|(F&(F&T))` is also always False, because it's False OR False which results in False.

   `((F|(F&(F&T)))|T)` is always True, because anything OR True is True. So, the whole expression `(F|(F&(F&T)))|T)` can be just replaced with T.
   
   Also, `!(q&F)` is always True because it’s NOT (something AND False), which is NOT False, and is therefore True. 

   `((!T)|(T|F))` is True. `(!T)` is False, but `(T|F)` is True, because True OR False is True. So False OR True is True.

   `((q&F)&((!T)|(T|F)))` is False AND True which is always False. 

   `((((!((q&F)&((!T)|(T|F))))|F)|F)|F))` is True OR False,  which is True. 

   Then `((e|(F|((F&(F&T))|T)))&((((!((q&F)&((!T)|(T|F))))|F)|F)|F))` is  `(e|True)&True` which is True AND True is True.
   
   Thus, this statement can be simplified to `(n&n)&True&(!T)` 

2. Now we can simplify things with ANDs. 

   `n&n` is simply `n` because something AND itself is just itself.

   `(!T)` is always False.

3. Thus, we can simplify the expression as `n&True&False` which is effectively `n&False` because True AND anything is the value of that thing and anytihng AND False is always False. 

4. So, the simplified formula is `False`.",F,T

((F&(u&((o&o)&F)))|(!(!((((o|(o&o))|F)&((o&(((o|(F&F))&(o|(o|o)))&(o|F)))&o))&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Since F & anything equals F, then (F&(u&((o&o)&F))) simplifies to F.

2. Since anything | F equals itself, then (o|(o&o))|F simplifies to (o | (o&o)). 

3. Since anything & F equals F, then (o|(F&F)) simplifies to o.

4. Since o | anything equals o, then o|(o|o) simplifies to o.

5. To go back to the original statement, (((o|(o&o))&((o&((o)&(o)))&o))&F) simplifies to F because the operation &F returns F.

6. The not (!) negates F to T, therefore, !F simplifies to T.

7. Negating T (!T) returns False, hence !T simplifies to F.

8. Now to the whole formula again, (F | (!(!F))) equals T because the OR operation between any value and True results in True.

So the simplified formula is T.",T,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First off, the value of the formula (T&T) is T. Thus we replace every instance of (T&T) in the formula with T.

 (((m|(((m|F)|(((m&T)&m)&((((s|F)&(!F))&T)|T)))&m))|F)|(m|(m|((m|m)&T))))|T.

2. The formula F|X simplifies to X because a logical OR with False doesn't have any effect on the value of X. Thus, we replace ((s|F)&(!F)) with (s&!F) and (m|F) with m:

((m|((m|((m&T)&m))&m))|(m|(m|(m&T))))|T.

3. The value of the formula X&X is X because the logical AND of any formula with itself doesn't alter the value of the formula. Therefore, (m&m) is the same as m and (m&T) as m since m&(True)=m:

((m|(m&m))|m)|T.

4. Applying the rule from step 3 again, we can reduce (m|m) to m:

(m|m)|T.

5. Finally, applying the rule from step 3 once more, the formula can be reduced to:

m|T.

6. Lastly, the formula X|T is always T because a logical OR with True will make the overall formula True, regardless of the value of X. Thus the simplified formula is:

Also, since anything OR with TRUE is always TRUE, and anything AND with FALSE is always FALSE, FF = FALSE and TF = TRUE and
((p & T) | F) = p and
((d | F) & (d | d)) = d and also
((d and d) | T) = T.
Therefore, the original formula simplifies to (c | !o | T), which is essentially T because anything OR with TRUE gives TRUE.

So, the simplified formula is T.",T,c

(!(!(((T|((l|(((T&(T&F))&F)&(!(T|(T|F)))))|T))|F)&((((x|(i&F))|F)&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's take the simplest pairs:
    T & F = F (True and False = False)
    T | F = T (True or False = True)
    not(T | T | F) = not(T) = F (Not True = False)
From this simplification we get:
    !(!(((T|((l|((T & F) & F) & F))|T))|F)&((((x | (i & F))|F)&F)&T)))

This simplifies to:
    !(!(((T|((l|(F & F) & F))|T))|F)&(((x | F)&F)&T)))

And this further simplifies to:
    !(!(((T|((l|F) & F)|T)|F)&((x & F)&T)))

The pair F & F = F.
The pair i & F = F and F | F = F
The pair T & F = F (because True and False = False)
The pair x & F = F (because any value and False = False)

So, continuing our simplification, we have:
    !(!(((T| F |T)|F)& F))

And since T or F = T and any value along with F gives us False except F or F is equal to F. This simplifies further to:
    !(!(T&F))

And since T and F = F, we get:
    !(!F)

Lastly, the negation of False (not False) is True. So, the simplified version of the original logical formula is:

2. Again, (t|t) can be simplified to t. Hence, this results to (t|T) which is always True. 
3. (!j|T) is always true and can be simplified to T.
4. (T|T) is always true and so this simplifies to T.
5. (F|T) is always true and this simplifies to T.
6. ((a|F)|T) simplifies to (a|T) because (a or False) is equivalent to a, and logically OR'ed with True results in True.
7. ((T&T)|T) simplifies to (T|T) because the ""and"" operation with two True values is always True. Then, logically OR'ed with True still results in True.
8. (p|F) is equivalent to p because logically or operation between any value and False results in the original value. This results in ((p&F)|T), which in fact simplifies to (F|T) because the and operation between any value and False is always False. This then simplifies to T because the or operation between any value and True always results in True.
9. Finally, ((t|T)&(T|t)) simplifies to (T&T) since logically OR'ed with True is always True. The logical AND operation of True is always True.

(iv) !T = F, a not True, evaluates to False

((T)&(l|((s&T)|(T|((True)|((!(True|F))|((z&z)&F)))))).

Continue simplifying, ""!(True|F)"" is equivalent to ""!T"" which is False. So it becomes:

2. `(w&T)` becomes `w` because `any Boolean value AND True = the Boolean value`.

3. `(!(T|T))` is `False` because `not True OR True = not True = False`.

4. `(h|T)` is `T` because `any Boolean value OR True = True`.

5. `(T| (F&(a|T)))` is `T` because `(F&(a|T))` is `False` (since `any Boolean value AND False = False`), and `T OR False = T`.

6. The next section `(T|(F&(a|T)))&F` is `F` because we found `(T|(F&(a|T)))` to be `T`, and `T AND False = False`.

7. `(u|(T|((!(T|T))& ((T|(F&(a|T)))&F))&T))` simplifies to `u|T` which is `T` because `any Boolean value OR True = True`.

The new formula is (T|(!(((T&F)|T)&(e&((F&(o&(T&F)))&(T&((F|T)&F)))))))

Step 3: T|anything is T
The new formula is just T 

The second part of the formula is: ((F&(T&F))|F).

First chunk is F&(T&F):
T&F is F
So, the formula becomes (F&F)|F.

Second chunk is (F&F)|F:
F&F is F

3. The statement (T&T) is always 'T', and (!T) is 'F'.

4. If we have a statement like (A&(!A)) or (A&F), they will always evaluate to 'F'. Thus, (((T&(!T))&T) turns into 'F'.

5. (A|F) is still A. So (F|((((x)&T)|((x)&x))&F))) turns into 'F'.

6. (!T) always gives 'F' and (T&F) will be 'F'. So, (!(T&T)) gives us 'F' too.

7. Using rule 4 we conclude that (F|(F)) is equivalent to 'F'.

Next, get rid of double negations (like !(!T) => T):

!((n&T)&(w&!(u&T)))

Applying the De Morgan's laws, we change a conjunction into a disjunction or vice versa by negating each element:

4. (((F|(T&T))&F)|F) = F, as (T&T) = T and anything AND False becomes False. Or False becomes False again. 

5. (T&F) = F since True AND False is always False.

3. ((((d & T) | d) | ((k | k) & F)) | d) & (d | (!T)), simplifies to (((d | d) | F) | d) & (d | F), because d & T becomes d, k | k becomes k, and k & F becomes F, and !T becomes F.

((z|z)&((((z|F)&(!((T&F)&(F|F))))&T)|(F&T)&z&T)) = after simplification of inner operations we get

(z&((z&!F)&T)&z&T) = here !T = F

z&z&T = after simplification of (z&!F) we get

z&T = simplifying z&z (because z AND z = z).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that ""T|X"" is always true for any X, so T|!(T&F) simplifies to T. Then, !(T) is always false. ""F|F"" is always false and ""F&X"" is always false for any X. Similarly, “T|X” is always true for any X. We use these rules to progressively simplify the formula:

Step 1: Replace (T|!(T&F)) with T:
Formula is (f|((f|(((f|(!T))&T)|F))|F))|(((f|(f&((((f&(f|(!T)))&T)&T)&f)))|F)|f)

Step 2: Replace (!T) with F:

Step 5: Replace ((f&T)&T)&f and (f|(f&T)) with f&T:

Step 6: Replace (f|(f&T)) with f:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The term ((T&F)) simplifies to F as in any AND operation, if one of the operands is false, the result is always false.
2. Thus, the expression (T|F) simplifies to T, because in any OR operation, if one of the operands is true, the result is always true.
3. Therefore, the term (w|(T|T)) turns to (w|T), which also simplifies to T, in the similar rules specified above.
4. Next, the term (!(T&((m|F)&T|T))) converts to (!(T&(T&T|T))) because (m|F) simplifies to M as any OR operation gives true if at least one of the operand true.
5. The term (T&T|T) further simplifies to T as in any AND operation, if all operands are true, the result is true.
6. Thus, the term (!(T&(T)) turns into !(T), because the AND operation with both operands as true gives true as result.
7. The term (t|!(F&F&T)) simplifies to (t|!F) because F&F&T simplifies to F as in any AND operation, if any one of the operands is false, the result is always false.
8. Hence, the term (t|!F) further simplifies to (t|T) as the NOT operation negates the value. So, !(F) is equivalent to T.
9. Therefore, the term (t|T) simplifies to T again using the rules of the OR operation.
10. With T|F simplifies to T, the term (!T|F), thus simplifies to !T and finally to F as the value of T when negated gives false.
11. So, the whole simplification becomes T&F.
12. Lastly, this simplifies to F, as in any AND operation, if any one of the operands is false, the result is always false.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we negate !F, which leads to F.
2. F & F = F, because a statement and itself is just that statement.
3. F | T is T, because in an or statement if one of them is true, then the result is true.
4. T & F is F, because in an and statement, if one of them is false, then result is false.
5. So the term ((F&(T&(!(!F))))|(F&(((t|t)&F)|T))) simplifies just to F.
6. We negate F, receiving T.
7. T & (!(!(T&T))) simplifies just to T, because a statement and its negation always equal false, and because we are saying that the statement and the statement are true, it is simply true.
8. So the original term ((F&T)|(!((F|T)&((F&(T&(!(!F))))|(F&(((t|t)&F)|T)))))|T) simplifies just to T.

2. Simplify (t&T) as t, and (F&T) as F. 

   The expression now:

1. (w & (F & ((F | F) & T))) | ((g | (((!(m & (n & (((l & F) & T) & ((!T) | T)))))) & ((d & (d | (d & d))) | T)) & T))

Based on the above rule, F | F is equal F, then we rename it:

2. (w & (F & (F & T))) | ((g | (!(m & (n&F)))) & (d | T) & T)

From this step we do similar operations, solving each grouping as possible. So we get:

3. (w & F) | (g | (!m & !n) & T)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the innermost parentheses. Recall that:

- & is logical AND operation, meaning both sides must be True for the whole to be True.
- | is logical OR operation, meaning at least one side must be True for the whole to be True.
- ! is logical NOT operation, it inverts the logical value.

1. (!T) is False (F).
2. So (d&(!T)) is (d&F), which is also False. 
3. Then, F|(d&(!T)) is F|F, which is False.
4. Hence, !(F|(d&(!T))) is !F, which is True. 
5. F&(((F&F)&(!T))|(F|T))is F&((F&F)|T) because T|F is always T.

7. F&((!(F&(F&(((F&F)&(!T))|(F|T)))))&T) is F&(!F & T) = F&T= F.

9. Now, (!(F|(d&(!T))))|F is T|F which is True.
10. Therefore, s|(!((!(F|(d&(!T))))|F)) simplifies to s|F, which just equals to s.

2. (T&F) term is equal to F, because & operation is true only if both literals are true.

3. Any literal value or true (x|T) is true as well, because | operation is true if either one or both literals are true.

- T | T | F | (q & F) equals to T (because T OR T is T, OR F is still T, OR (q AND F) is also T).
- T & F equals to F (because T AND F is F).

- ((x & T) & T) is x (because x AND T is x, and then x AND T is again x).

5. `T | X` is equivalent to `T`, where `X` can be any logical formula.

Using these rules, let's simplify the formula:

So, we will apply this principle whenever possible.

Step 1: Remove redundancy
F&T simplifies to F 
q|q simplifies to q
T|F simplifies to T
q|q simplifies to q
q|(q|F) simplifies to q|F
T|(T|...) simplifies to T

Step 2: Simplify the & and | operations to get final result
!(!(F|F)) simplifies to !(F), which is True (T)

4. Regardless of u and f, (F|F) will return False. Hence, u&((f|T)&(F|F)) will always be False.

5. Since the 'and' operation is being applied, (((u&((f|T)&(F|F)))&F)|T)&F equals False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","We know a few things:
1. Anything AND False is False.
2. Anything OR True is True.
3. NOT False is True and NOT True is False.
4. The AND operation is associative, ie. (a AND b) AND c equals a AND (b AND c), the same applies to the OR operation. In the same way, you can remove any unnecessary parentheses.
5. True AND True is True

Now, we'll apply these rules to our problem starting by the innermost parentheses:

(!(!(T&(T|T)))) turns into !(!T) by the 3rd and 5th rules which is T by third rule.

((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T)) is now (F&T&T) and by the first rule, is F.

So, ((j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T)) is j&T by first and second rule, which is just j, because anything AND True retains its initial value.

Next, 

(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F)))))) simplifies to !(i|(!F)) thanks to the rules 2 and 1. Then using rule 3 it further simplifies to !(i|T), which simplifies to !T = F thanks to rules 2 and 3.

The expression (((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T) simplifies to (F|F)|T, and by rule 1 it transforms to F|T which is T by rule 2.

At this point the entire formula simplifies to:

((j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T))&(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T)) = j&T = j",j,j
99,logic,self_consistency,(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively.

(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, look at the innermost brackets that can be simplified:
!T equals F, so !(!T) equals to !F, which is T.
The operation T|T will be always T; T|F will be always T; F|anything will be  equal to 'anything' according to the laws of the Logical OR operation.
So let's rewrite out simplified points together:

(((s&(T|F))&s)|(s|(s&((o&T)&(h|T)&F&T)))).

Now, let's simplify further:
T|any equals T; s&T equals s because anything AND True equals to the anything itself; F&any equals F according to the logic AND operation.
Let's rewrite again:

((s&s)|s|(s&(F))).

Now, let's simplify this: s&s is s; s&F is F, because anything AND False equals to False itself.

So the final simplified form of the logical formula is:

s|s|F.

According to the OR operation, if one part of the operation is True, all OR operations equals True. 
In our case, we have s|s|F -> s|F -> s. 

The final simplified form of the logical formula is: s.",s,s
