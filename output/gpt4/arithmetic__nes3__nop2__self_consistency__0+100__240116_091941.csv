A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, compute each parentheses from innermost to the outermost:

-80-7 = -87, and take the modulo -100: -87 mod -100 = -87.
So, (-80-7) = -87.

53+91 = 144, but take the modulo 100 because it's positive: 144 mod 100 = 44.
So, (53+91) = 44.

-89-79 = -168, and take the modulo -100: -168 mod -100 = -68.
So, (-89-79) = -68.

17+69 = 86, take the modulo 100: 86 mod 100 = 86.

-68 - 86 = -154, and take the modulo -100: -154 mod -100 = -54.

44 - (-87) = 44+87 = 131, and take the modulo 100: 131 mod 100 = 31.

Now, substitute these values back into the original equation:

After that we perform multiplication:

-98*60 = -5880

Taking modulo 100, we get -80. Now our expression looks like this:

19+2 = 21, and -8-83 = -91. 

21-(-91) = 21 + 91 = 112. Modulo 100, it becomes 12.

We add these two results, 98 + -18 = 80 (modulo 100 since it is positive).

In the second expression, we subtract 18 from 61 to get 43.

We multiply these two results, so 43 * 19 = 817. But we can take modulo 100 since it is positive, so we get 17.
