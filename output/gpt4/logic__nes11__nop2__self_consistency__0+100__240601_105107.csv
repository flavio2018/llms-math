A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Since True AND True equals True, T&T simplifies to T. 
2. Next, True AND False (T&F) is always False. 
3. The negation of False (!F) is True.
4. Following from the above, (T&T)|T is equivalent to T|T which is True and (((T&T)|T)&(!F)) simplifies to T. 
5. Therefore, m&(((T&T)|T)&(!(T&F))))&T simplifies to m&T. 
6. From the definition of T&F, the formula simplifies to m&F. This also simplifies to False.
7. So, the term m|(T&F)&T simplifies to m&F, which simplifies to False. 
8. The left parts of first OR simplify to ((m|((m&T)|(m&True)))|(m|m)). This is equivalent to m|m, which always equals m.

2. Now, we can see that F&T = F. So, ((F&(T&T))|((F&T) & F))=0. Hence, j&0&(w|T) will still be 0. The statement (((j&0)&j)|j) finally equals j. So the entire formula simplifies to ((j&j)|j)|j.

3. From the Associative Laws of Logic, we can rearrange terms as desired without affecting the logical outcome. Hence, ((j&j)|j)|j = j&(j|(j|j)) = j&(j|j) = j&j = j.

((y|F)&((y&(T&s|T))|y)&(y|(g&s&F)&y))|(F|T)

Next, ""(T&s|T)"" just simplifies to ""T"" and ""(g&s&F)"" simplifies to ""F"". Therefore, our equation transforms into:

4. `(i|F)` is `i`, because anything OR with `F` is itself (in this case, `i`).
5. `(i&i)` is `i`, because anything AND with itself is itself.
6. So `((((((i|F)|(((i&i)&i)|((z&F)&T)))|(i|F))&i)&(i&(i&i)))&T)` simplifies to `(i|i)&i&T`, which further simplifies to `i&T`.
7. The expression `(i|(i&(i&T)))` simplifies to `i` because `i` OR ( `i` AND any value ) will always be `i`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!(!F)) simplifies to F because a double negation cancels out. So, our formula now looks like this: ((v|F)|((v|F)|(F|(F&(((((z|T)&(!T))&(f&F))&T)&F)|T)|(T|(T|((r&r)|T))))))).

2. Any term combined with 'F' under the logical OR operation, |, results in the term's original value, because OR operation with False doesn't change the result. So, (v|F) simplifies to v. Our formula now becomes: (v|v|((F|(F&(((((z|T)&(!T))&(f&F))&T)&F)|T)|(T|(T|((r&r)|T)))))).
   
3. (z|T) simplifies to T, because for any value, OR operation with True always results in True. Similarly, (T|(T|(T|((r&r)|T)))) simplifies to T because again for any value, OR operation with True always results in True. Another simplification here: (f&F) simplifies to F because for any value, AND operation with False always results in False. Hence, our expression looks like: (v|v|((F|(F&((T&(!T))&F)&F)|T))).

4. (T&(!T)) simplifies to F, as we are saying something is both True and not True, which can't be possible. Thus, our formula now becomes: (v|v|((F|(F&F&F)|T))).

5. (F&F), (F&F&F) simplifies to F because for any value, AND operation with False always results in False. (F|F), simplifies to F because OR operation with False doesn't change result. Thus, our expression now becomes: (v|v|(F|T)).

6. (F|T) simplifies to T because something being either False or True will always be True. So, our formula simplifies to: (v|v|T).

2. `T & Anything = Anything`. So we can ignore the AND T and the last term in the expression simplifies to `((w | (((w | (((w & w) | w) | w)) & w) | F)) | T)`.
3. `F | Anything = Anything`. So, `((w | (((w | ((((w & w) = w) | w) | w)) & w) | F)) = ((w | ((((w | w) | w) | w)) & w))`.
4. Inside, observe that `(w | w) = w` and `(w & w) = w`. So we can simplify `((w | ((((w | w) | w) | w)) & w)) to ((w | w) & w) = w & w = w`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first simplification can occur by applying the law of nature (anything logical AND with false is false) to the parts '(o&F)' and '(g&F)', making them false:

((l&(l&((g&((((e&(!F))&(e|((e|e)|F)))|e)|T))|(k|((T|F)&T)))))&(l|((T|T)&F))).

Anything logical OR with false is the other value, so '((T|F)&T)' becomes '(T&T)' or just T, '(!F)' becomes T and '((e|e)|F)' becomes 'e'. So, we have:

((l&(l&((g&((((e&T)&(e|e))|e)|T))|(k|T))))&(l|(F))).

The logical OR with F can be eliminated and also logical AND with T:

((l&(l&((g&(((e&(e))|e))|T))|(k|T)))&l).

Since '(e&e)' is just 'e', '(T|k)' is just T and '(e|e)' is just e we have:

((l&(l&((g&(e|T))|T)))&l).

Since anything logical OR with true gives true:

((l&(l&(g|T)))&l).

And finally, using the fact that G OR T is just T:

((l&(l&T))&l).

So, the expression
((y|F)&((!(!(F&(!(!T)))))|(!((((((F|F)|F)|(((F&(!F))&(!(a|T)))&F))&T)|F)|T))))
can be simplified as:
((y|F)&((!(!(F&(!F))))|(!((F&((F&F)&F))))))
 
2. Next, simplifying (F&(!F)) results in F since both values must be True for & operator to return True and we know one is False.

((y|F)&((!(!F))|(!((F&F)))))
 
3. Now, we can further simplify by dealing with ""not"" (!) operator. 
!F is T.

((y|F)&(T|F))
 
 
4. The expression now becomes:

(y|F) & T

5. we know that (any binary operator)& T = (that binary operator) 

Therefore, this equation simplified becomes:

y|F

6. lastly y|F simplifies to y since a value | False always returns the value before the | operator.

So, the final simplification is:

- Thus, `((r|T)&(T&T))&F` simplifies to `T&F` which simplifies to `F`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula simplifies as follows:

Step 1: Logical not flips true to false and vice versa. Thus, !F becomes T.

(!(!((!F)&((v|T)|((T|((!(T|T))&((((F|F)|F)|(T|(T&F)))|T)))|(T&(T|F))))))

becomes 

(!(!(T&((v|T)|((T|((!(T|T))&((((F|F)|F)|(T|(T&F)))|T)))|(T&(T|F))))))

Step 2: Contained inside, we have (T&F). As logical 'and' is true only if both literals are true, T&F becomes F. 

(!(!(T&((v|T)|((T|((!(T|T))&((((F|F)|F)|(T|(T&F)))|T)))|(T&(T|F))))))

becomes

(!(!(T&((v|T)|((T|((!(T|T))&((((F|F)|F)|(T|F)))|T)))|(T&(T|F))))))

(!(!(T&((v|T)|((T|((!(T|T))&T))|T)))|(T&(T|F))))))

Step 4: We have ((T&(T|F))), logical 'or' is true if either of the literals is true, so this becomes T&T which simplifies to T.

(!(!(T&((v|T)|((T|T)|T))|T)))

Step 5: We have !(T|T). Logical 'or' is true if either of the literals is true, so this becomes !T which simplifies to F.

(!(!(T&((v|T)|(F|T))|T)))

Step 6: We have (T&((v|T)|F)|T)), logical 'or' is true if either of the literals is true, so this becomes T&((v|T)|T)

((!((T&((v|T)|T))|T)))

Step 7: Finally, we simplify this to (!T). This is because T & (v | T) = T, because for T to be true, v or T must be true. Therefore, this simplifies as (!T | T) which further simplifies to T as one side must be true.

Then, we simplify T&F again to F.

So, ((z&((T&F)|T))|F)|((z&(!((!F)|((z|T)|F)|(!(T|F))))&F)|F).

Then simplify !F which is always T.

So, ((z&((T&F)|T))|F)|((z|((T|((z|T)|F)|!(T|F)))&F)|F).

2. (B&A)&C = B&(A&C) - the order in which 'and' operations are performed does not matter (associativity).
3. (B|A)|C = B|(A|C) - the order in which 'or' operations are performed does not matter (associativity).
4. B|A, A|B - the order in which 'or' operations are carried out does not change the result (commutativity).
5. A&F = F, A&!A = F - anything 'and' false gives false, anything 'and' its negation gives false (annihilation).
6. A|A = A - anything 'or' with itself remains itself (idempotence).
7. A|F = A - anything 'or' with false remains itself (identity).
8. A|T = T - anything 'or' with true gives true (domination).
9. A&T = A - anything 'and' with true remains itself (identity).
10. !(!A) = A - the negation of a negation returns to the original value (double negation). 

According to these principles, your formula simplifies as follows:

(((i&((i|(i&(i&i))))&i)&(((((((i&((i|(i&((i&T)|i))))&(((a|F)|a)&a))|T)|T))|F)&T)|i)&T))

3. From that, `(o&(o&o))` is only `o`, resulting in `(o&o)` which is `o`.

5. `(o&u)` simplifies to `o` when `u` is `True` and `F` when `u` is `False`.

6. Finally, `!(!u)` converts to `u`. Thus the whole sentence simplifies to `(F|u)`.

7. `(F|u)` simplifies to `u` because `(False or u)` is equal to the value of `u`. If `u` is `True` the whole sentence is `True`, and if `u` is `False`, the whole sentence is `False`.

Notice that (T|F) = T, and any value AND F (False) is F. Substituting those values in simplifies to:

(!(T|!(T&F))&F) | F

Now, (T&F) = F, so substitute this back in to get:

(!(T|!F)&F) | F

Obviously, Not False is True, and anything OR True is True. Substituting back into the equation:

(!(T|T)&F) | F

Once again, anything OR True is True, so the equation simplifies further down to:

(!T&F) | F

Finally, anything AND False is False, and anything OR False is itself. Therefore, the solution is:

F | F = F

3. F&T simplifies to F for the same reason.
4. For F|(z|(F|T)), F or-ed with anything is the same as the 'anything'. So it simplifies to z|T.
5. Since z or-ed with True is always True, so it simplifies to T.
6. F&T simplifies to F.
7. t&F simplifies to F.
8. F|T is T because false or true is always true.
9. So the whole first part t&(((((((u&u)&F)&T)&(F|(z|(F|T))))&T)&T)|T is T.

3. As False & T  is False, it simplifies further to o|((False)|(F|((F)|((x|F)&T)|((x&x)&x))&F)).
4. x|F is equal to x as the ""or"" operator will always result in the value of True if one of the variables is True, so if x is True, the operation would result in True. If x is False, the operation would result in False.
5. x&x&x is the same as x.
6. So the above expression becomes o|(F|(((x)&T)|x)&F)
7. x|x is still just x.
8. So we have o|(F|((x&T)&F)), and x&T is True if x is True and False otherwise, so let's call it z.
9. The expression is now o|(F|(z&F)). z&F is always False so it simplifies to o|F, which is always o - the ""or"" operator will always result in True if one of the variables is True.
10. Inside the brackets, we have o, o|o, and o once more, and the result of the operation o|o is o. Therefore, the bracketed expression [(o|(o|o))|o] simplifies to o.

Let's simplify the inner lines first:

The expression (!((n&T)&(F))) simplifies then to:

1. ""!"" negates the value after it, so ""!F"" is T (true) and ""!T"" is F (false).
2. ""T&T"" is T. The operation ""&"" returns true if both values are true, so it is true when T AND T.  However this result does not matter because if any operand for ""|"" operation is true, the result will be True. But also in the same operation there is ""F|"", so the overall result will be False  because if any operand for ""&"" operation is false, the result will be False.
3. As with the above, ""F&F"" returns F, because & requires both values to be true to return true.

So, several simplifications come as follows:
- ((F&F)|(((T|((((o&(T&o))&T)|T))&F)&(!F)))&(T&F)) Simplify !F and !T, F|...&..&F and T|...
- ((F)|(((T|((o&T)&T)&F)&(T)))&(F)) Simplify F&F and T&F
- (F|((T&F)&T)&F) Simplify (|T) which does nothing and can be ignored

The final simplification can be written as follows:

4. anything&F is always F ('anything' and false is always false). This is because 'and' only returns true if both inputs are true. So if one is false, return value is always false.

As per standard logic rules:

  1) ""FALSE & anything"" results in FALSE - since 'and' operation requires both conditions to be true to result in true. So we replace ""(F&F)"", ""((i&i)&(i|i))&T)|T)&F"" and ""(F|(F&(T&(((r|(r&r))|r)&F)))"" with F. 

  2) ""TRUE | anything"" results in TRUE - since 'or' operation requires only one condition to be true to result in true. So we replace ""T|(((((i&i)&(i|i))&T)|T)&F))))"" with T.

  3) ""anything & TRUE"" results in ""anything"" - since 'and' operation with TRUE doesn't alter the other operand. So we replace ""x&(x&(T"" with ""x&x"".

  4) ""anything | FALSE"" results in ""anything"" - since 'or' operation with FALSE doesn't alter the other operand.

So, the expression reduces to:

((v&v)|((x&x)&F))

Then, 

  ""v&v"" simplifies to ""v"", so does ""x&x"".

So, the expression now reduces to: (v|(x&F))

Finally, as we have already established that ""anything & FALSE"" results in FALSE, the expression can be simplified further to:

Again, ""anything | FALSE"" results in ""anything"", we get:

4) (g|(z&F)) is equivalent to (g|F) which is g, since anything AND with false results in false.
5) Then (g|(g|F)) simplifies to (g|(g)) equals to g.
6) The expressions (g|T), (d|T) are equivalent to T, since anything OR with true results in true.

8) (((i&(i|F))&(((g|(g|F))|(g|(z&F)))|T))&T) simplifies to (i&T).

10) ((d|F)|T) simplifies to T and
11) ((i&T)|((d|F)|T)) simplifies to (i|T). Anything OR with true results in true. So, the whole expression equals to T.

(T|F) will always be T and (F&T) will always be F. So, ((q&((T|F)|(F&T))) can be simplified to ((q&((T|F)|F)). Now (T|F) will be T. So, the whole part reduces to (q & T).

Now q or F will be q since 'or' operation is being performed. So, the whole part becomes (q & F). (q & F) will be F because F which is universal false will make the resultant false while performing and operation. So, the whole part becomes: (F&T). (F & T) will be F.

1.2. (F | X) results in the same value X, where X is either True or False.
1.3. (T & X) results in the same value X, where X is either True or False.
1.4. (F & X) always results in False, where X is either True or False.

2. The NOT (!) operator only transforms True into False and vice versa.

Using these facts, we can simplify the formula as follows:

Step 1: Simplify nested statements

((F|F)&T) simplifies to F (from 1.4.)
!((F|F)&T) simplifies to T (from 2.)
(b|b) simplifies to b
(b|b)&b simplifies to b

((d|(((((b|b)&b)|F)&F)))|(F|(d&(((!T)&T)&F)))) simplifies to d (from 1.1. and 1.2.)

(T|T) simplifies to T (from 1.1.)
(b|T) simplifies to T (from 1.1.)

2. On other part, you see (!(((T|T)|(!T))&T)) which will simplify to (!((T&T)) which simplifies to !(T) and that lead to False.

3. Now let's simplify ((((n&(T&F))&F)&F)|T)), which becomes ((n&F)&F)|T, as we know n&F would always be F, so formula becomes (F&F)|T, which simplifies to F|T => T.

4. Now (((((s|(!T))|s)|s)&s)&F), would simplify to ((((s|F)|s)|s)&F), s|F will always be s, simplifying it we get, (((s|s)|s)&F), s|s will always be s, simplifying it we get ((s|s)&F) which becomes (s&F) and will always be F.

5. From these steps, our formula now is simplified to ((((r&T)&r)&r)&F), r&T will always be r, thus simplifying the formula to ((r&r)&F), r&r is r, so the statement becomes (r&F), which will always be False (F).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: We start by simplifying everything inside the innermost brackets.
      For any value e, (e|e) simplifies to e, (e&e) simplifies to e and (T|F) simplifies to T. The expression becomes:
      
      ((!(((e&((e|((e&(l|T))&e)&e))|(e|e)))|(F&(F&F)))|T))|(!((T|F)&T))

Step 2: The expression ""F&F"" simplifies to F. Then ""F&(F&F)"" simplifies to F again. ""T|F"" simpllifies to T. The expression becomes:

      ((!(((e&((e|((e&(l|T))&e)&e))|e))|F)|T))|(!(T&T))

Step 3: In logic, (e&(l|T)) simplifies to e as (l|T) is always True. Also, (T&T) simplifies to T. The expression becomes:

      ((!(((e&((e|(e&e))&e))|e))|F)|T)|(!T)

Step 4: Any scenario ""e&e"" simplifies to simply e. ""F|T"" simplifies to T. ""T|F"" simplifies to T. The expression becomes:

      ((!(((e&((e|e)&e))|e))|T)|(!T))

Step 5: The expression ""(e|e)&e"" simplifies to e. ""e&e"" simplifies to e. We do another simplification ""!T"" which simplifies to F. The expression becomes:

      ((!((e&e)|e))|T)|F

Step 6: The expression ""(e&e)|e"" simplifies to e. ""T|F"" simplifies to T. And ""F|T"" simplifies to T. The expression becomes:

      (!(e))|T)

Step 7: The expression ""(!(e))|T"" simplifies to T, as anything OR'd with T becomes True. Hence, the expression simplifies to:

      T

So, the simplified form of the given logic formula is ""T"" or True.",T,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify some obvious parts:

F&anything = F
T&anything = anything
T|anything = T
F|anything = anything
!T = F
!F = T

Following these rules, we can simplify the logic formula to: 

=j&T&T = j

So the final simplification of the logic formula is: j.",j,j

(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T|T is T since T OR T = T.
2. Then, !(T) becomes !T = F since NOT(inverse) of True is False.
3. T|!T simplifies to T because T or False is T. 
4. F&T becomes F because False and True is False.
5. Let's replace T|(F&T) is thus T. 

The simplifications thus far change the expression to: 
(((s&(T|F))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!F))&((h|(T|F))|T))&F)&T)))). 

6. s&(T|F) simplifies to s&T because s and True is s.
7. h|(T|F) simplifies to T because h or True is True. 
8. !F is T because not False is True. 
9. (T|F) simplify to T because True or False is just True. 

The simplifications thus far change the expression to:
(((s&T)&s)|(s|(s&((((o&T)&T)&F)&T)))). 

10. (s&T)&s simplifies to s & s which is just s. 
11. ((o&T)&T)&F simplifies to o&T&F which is always False because anything AND False is False.

The simplifications thus far change the expression to (((s)&s)|(s|(s&F))).  

12. s&s is again s. 
13. s&F simplifies to F because anything AND False is False.

The simplifications thus far change the expression to ((s|s)|F).

14. s|s simplifies to s because s OR s is just s. 

So, 

(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T))))

reduces to s. 

The simplified logic formula is s.",s,s
