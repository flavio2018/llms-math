((25-44)-(-37+76)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, you should solve the expressions in parentheses:

25 - 44 = -19
-37 + 76 = 39

When computing modulo -100 and 100 of -19:

-19 mod 100 = -19 (since -19 is a negative value, and less than 100)
-19 mod -100 = -81 (because -100 - (-19) = -81)

When computing modulo -100 and 100 of 39:

39 mod 100 = 39
39 mod -100 = -61 (because -100 - (39) = -61)

We don't have to calculate both positive and negative modulo, just the one that pertains to our operation, but for the sake of completeness, all are determined.

So the expression now states (-19) - 39 (or -81 - (-61)).

The result is -58 (or -20 if you use the negative modulos).

-58 mod 100 = -58
-58 mod -100 = -42

or using negative modulo:

-20 mod 100 = -20
-20 mod -100 = -80

So answer would be either -58 using positive modulo, or -42 using negative modulo for the first case and either -20 using positive modulo or -80 using negative modulo for the second case.",-58 or -42 or -20 or -80,-58
