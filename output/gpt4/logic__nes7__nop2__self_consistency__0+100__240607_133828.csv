    (!T)&T = F&T = F   Because false AND anything is always false.
    !(T&T) = !(T) = F. Because double negation will give the original value.

So, the reduced formula is ((((k|F)&T)&F)|(F&(!(!(!(F|(T&T)))))).

Further simplifying we find:
k|F = k because when any value is logically or-ed with False, that value remains.

So, the formula becomes: (((k&T)&F)|(F&(!(!(!(F|(T&T)))))).

Next, simplify T&T = T because when True is logically and-ed with True, it always gives True. 
F|(T&T) = F|T = T because when False logically or-ed with True, it will always give True.
So, the equation becomes:

(((k&T)&F)|(F&(!(!(!T))))).

Keeping in mind that !T equals F and therefore !(!T) equals T and !(!(!T)) equals F, we can simplify further:

(((k&T)&F)|(F&F)).

Then k&T = k if k is true and false if k is false, so we rewrite the formula:

Then, F|anything is just the ""anything"", so F|(((c|((T&F)&(q&F)))&F)&T)) is just F.

2. `l|T` always is True because we're or-ing with a True, which will always yield True. It simplifies to `T`.
3. `(y|F)` simplifies to `y` because or-ing with False does not change the original value.
4. `!F` simplifies to `T` because we're taking the not of False, which changes it to True.
5. `!(!T)` simplifies to `T` because double negation gets us back to the original value.

So, we've simplified the formula to `((F|((y|((y&T)&y))|T))|T)` so far.

5. ""F|T"" will always be T, as logical 'or' will be true if either condition is true.

Now, look at ""F|(n&F)"". Since False (F) and anything joined with ""or"" (|) can be simply simplified to that ""anything"", this part of the expression simplifies to just ""n&F"". 

Replacing this in our expression it becomes: 
(!(((n&F)&(T|(F|F|F)))&F)&(!T)).

Then look at (n&F), using same rule F and anything with AND operation means False. So this can be replaced with F.

So the expression become :

Now consider the part ""T|(F|F|F)"", i.e. True or False or False or False. The meaning of logical ""or"" is that it's true if either side of the ""or"" statement is true. Since True OR anything must be True, we simplify this to T.

So the expression now becomes:
((!((F&T)&F))&(!T)).

Again, observe ""F&T"". We already know that False and anything is false, so this becomes simply F.

Replacing in our expression gives us:
((!(F&F))&(!T)).

Again, since False and anything is false, we get:

((!F)&(!T)).

Finally, we note that the not symbol (!) negates the value that follows it. Thus, !F is true (T) and !T is false (F). Replacing these, we get:

Rewriting the expression with these simplifications will give us:

We can simplify the expression !(false) to True, so we get:

Rewriting the equation to remove the not before true will give us:

!(false | (o | (c | (false| false | true))))

2. Next, h&F simplifies to F as anything AND False gives False. The expression then becomes:

3. Also, the expression T|F|F simplifies to T, as anything OR-ed with T is T. And, T&F gives False, so we are left with:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the inner most brackets. 

In this case, let's start with (F | (!F) | T). Since (!F) denotes not false, which translates to true and T is True, the whole expression becomes True as in a logical OR operation if any one is true then the result is True.

Now we are left with (!(!((T)|F) & (T & ((g | F & T) & F)))).

Now let’s simplify (F & T) within the bracket, this becomes False because in a logical AND operation if any one is False then the result is False.

Now the expression looks like (!(!((T)|F) & (T & ((g | F) & F)))). 

The expression (((g | F) & F)) simplifies to false, as F & any_value = false.

Our expression becomes (!(!((T)|F) & (T & F))), which simplifies to (!(!(T) & False)) because T & false is always False.

The expression becomes (!False) which simplifies to True. Therefore, (!(!(((F|((!F)|T))|F)&(T&((g|(F&T))&F))))) = True.",True,F

((F|T) = T as Anything OR with True results in True
(T&F) = F as Anything AND with False results in False

Step 2: Negation of F, !F is T

Step 3: e OR (!F) = e|T = T as Anything OR with True results in True

Step 4: So, the entire sub-expression (((F|T)|(T&F))|F)|(e|(!F)) simplifies to T (from Step 1) OR T (from step 3) equals to T

Step 5: (T&T) = T as Anything AND with True results in same value, here True.

Step 6: From Step 5, (T&((((F|T)|(T&F))|F)|(e|(!F)))) becomes T&T = T

Step 7: (F|T) = T as Anything OR with True results in True.

Step 8: So, ((F|T)&T) simplifies to T&T = T

Step 9: Now, look at the entire expression again, (F|F)&(T|T) = F&T = F as Anything AND with False results in False.

Since T&T is just T, the formula further simplifies to !(r&T).

Then, we can simplify (s|True), which gives True because anything ORed with True is True.

Next, the element ((F&((F|(T&F))|F))|F) can be simplified. (T&F) equals False and (F|(False)) equals False, which yields us F.

That makes, ((F&False)|F) = (F|F) and this result is F.

1. `f|f&f` - the 'and' operation here does not change the output as 'f and f' is still 'f', therefore, this simplifies to 'f'.

2. `T|F` - this operation simply results in 'T' because the 'or' operation is true when either of its operands are true.

3. `F&T` - this operation will be 'F' because 'and' operation is true only when both operands are true. 

4. `f|F` - the 'or' operation will result in 'f' because it is true when at least one operand is true, and 'f' can be true. 

Therefore, the first part of the expression, `f|(f&f))|(F&(T|F))|(f|F))&((f&T)` simplifies to:
`(f | F) & (f & T)`, which in turn simplifies to `f & T`, because the 'or' operation with 'False' ('F') will result in whatever the other operand is, and 'f and True' is 'f' (as for 'and', if one operand is true, the result follows the other operand).

Then, continuing to simplify F&(F&F) gives us F. The result (F) will be false no matter how many times we apply logical 'and' to it, and with whatever value.

Next, consider the expression (q|q). This evaluates to q itself; because if q is true, True or True = True, and if q is false, False or False = False.

Next, Not operator (!) negates the result of the expression next to it. Therefore !(q) is equivalent to !q.

Applying the not operator ((!) twice, like in !(!q), does not affect the result. Therefore !(!q) = q.

Again, going back to our expression (T&F) evaluates to F, because according to 'and' operator's rules, whatever we and with false becomes false.
