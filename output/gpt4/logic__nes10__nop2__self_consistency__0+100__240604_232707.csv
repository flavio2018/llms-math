2. In the same manner F| anything will always be the whatever the another value is, so simplify it by removing the F. Also, T&T will also be True and True and anything will be that value itself.

3. The expression (F&T) simplifies to F, since false and anything is false.
4. The expression (F&(!T)) simplifies to F, since false and anything is false.
5. (!F) simplifies to T, since the negation of false is true. 
6. The expression (((c&c)|c)|c)|c), where c is either True or False, simplifies to c, since anything or-ed with itself is itself.
7. By De Morgan's law, !(F&(!c)) simplifies to T|c, because the negation of and is or.
8. By De Morgan's law, !(T|c) simplifies to !T&!c, again because the negation of or is and. However, in our case where !T is always false, !T&!c simply reduces to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Simplify `(T|F)`:
   It's logical disjunction operation, which returns true if at least one of the components is true. Since `T` (True) is present, it returns True.

2. Simplify `(F&T)` and `(F&F)`:
   It's logical conjunction operation, which returns true if both the components are true. If any component is False, it returns False.
   
    Hence, `(F&T)` and `(F&F)` simplifies to `F`.

3. Clearly `(k&(x&F))` will be `F`, because anything AND with `F` returns `F`. So, `(!(k&(x&F))` translates into `!F`, which is `T` (because `!` is logical Negation which changes True into False and False into True).
   
   Similarly, `(!(T&(T&T)&F))` simplifies to `!F` and finally to `T`.

F&T is always F because AND operation with F is always F regardless of the other operand. 

T|T|T is always T because OR operation is inclusive i.e., it returns T when any/all of the operands is T. 

Replacing these values in the expression, we get:

!((T)|(((((F)&(T|T)))|F)|((l|T)|T))|F|(F))

The term (F)&(T|T) would be F as there is an AND operation with F. Replacing this, we get:

!((T)|((F)|F)|((l|T)|T))|F|(F))

Since OR operation with F effectless, and T|T|T is still T, and l OR'd with T is T, we're left with:

- If both the sub-expressions are True, it returns True.

For OR operator,

- If both the sub-expressions are False, it returns False.

- Any expression with AnyValue&(True) becomes simply AnyValue,
- Any expression with AnyValue|(True) becomes simply True.

The logical AND operation with True doesn't change the result, so, we simplify  (d&T) to d and (a&T) to a.

The logical AND operation with False always results in False. Hence, (F&(((a&T)|a)&(((!F)&(T&T))&F))) simplifies to F and (d&F) simplifies to F.

1. From the innermost conditions, T|F , T&T, and F&F simplify to T, T, and F, respectively.
2. Therefore, T|F and T|F & T&T also becomes T. They occur in two places in the formula, so we replace them with T.

T & F = F
T | F = T
T | T = T
F & T = F

Now, focusing on !F:
!F = T

So the formula becomes:

((F)&((T|y&T)))&F))

Now, focusing on ""T|y"":

Since ""T""|anything = T, so T|y = T.

Thus, the formula became:

(F&T&F)

Now focusing on ""F&T"":
F & T = F

So, the formula simplifies to:

Also, in any OR operation with True, or any AND operation with False, the outcome will be True or False respectfully. 

Applying these rules to the given logic formula, we will simplify like this:

Step 1:
((((d|((T&(!((F|(T&(T|T)))|F)))&T))|(F&((w|(!(!(!((F|F)|T)))))|T)))|(!F))
Notice that (T|(T&T)) is equivalent to T, and (T|T) is also equivalent to T, and this applies to all other conditions.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the constants in the equation.

T or anything is always T, because T is true. 

F or anything is just the value of anything, because F is false and doesn't influence the result of ""or"".

T and anything is the value of anything, because T is true and doesn't influence the result of ""and"". 

F and anything is always F, because F is false.

Negation of T (!T) is F, and negation of F (!F) is T.

So let's simplify accordingly:

1. Substitute T|Anything = T
   T|(g|T) = T
   T|(F|(T|T)) = T

2. Substitute F|Anything = Anything
   F|(T|T) is T, but anything or T is again T. So substitute it.

3. Substitute F&Anything = F
   F&(T|((F|(T|T)))) simplifies to F

4. Substitute T&Anything = Anything
   ((a|a)&T) simplifies to a

Applying these substitutions.

((a & ((!(!T)) | (T | F)))) | a

Next, let's simplify double negatives and logical operations:

5. Substitute !(!Anything) = Anything
    !(!T) minimizes to T

6. Substitute Anything | T = T 
    (T | F) minimizes to T

So it now simplifies to

((a & (T))| a)

Now we can use again use rule 4 to simplify a & T to a:

(a | a)

  This becomes:

  ((T|F)&(x&(((((((z&(z&T))&T)&T)|(F&(n|(F|T))))|z)&T)&(F&F)))).

2. Again we apply some identities; False and False is False (F&F = F), True and True is True (T&T = T), False or True is True (F|T = T), True or any proposition is True (T|p = T). So we continue to simplify:

  ((T|F)&(x&(((((((z&(z&T))&T)&T)|(F&(n|T)))|z)&T)&F)).

  ((T)&(x&(((((((z&T))&T)&T)|F)|z)&T)&F)).

  ((T)&(x&((((((z&T)&T)|F)|z)&T)&F)).

4. Using commutative law in (z&(F|(!T))) we get:
(((!T)&((!T)|((z&(!T|F))|(!T))))|(!F))

5. !T|F will always be True. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:
(((!T)&((!T)|((z&True)|(!T))))|True)

6. Anything AND true equals to itself, also anything OR true equals to true. So:
(((!T)&(!T)|True)

7. Using an idempotent law for AND operation ((F&F)<=>F) we get:

3. T&P is equivalent to P. 
4. F&P is equivalent to F. 
5. P|F is equivalent to P. 
6. P&F is equivalent to F. 

Let's apply these to simplify the given formula.

Given: 

(((q&q)|q)&(((x&((x|(((T&(T&T))&F)|((F&(F|T))|F)))|F))|(x&(x|((F&T)&T))))&F))

First ((q&q)|q) is equivalent to (q|q) by the law 1 that simplifies further to q by the law 2. 

Moving to (((x&((x|(((T&(T&T))&F)|((F&(F|T))|F)))|F))|(x&(x|((F&T)&T))))&F))

We know that F&T is equivalent to F by law 4 that simplifies the above expression to:

((x&((x|((T&F)|((F&T)|F)))|F))|(x&(x|F)))&F))

Further, (T&F) and (F&T) both are equivalent to F, so the above expression will simplify to:

((x&((x||F)|F))|(x&(x|F)))&F)

Expression (((x||F)|F))|(x&(x|F)) reduces to (x|F) because of the law 5 and then reduces to x as || means logical or operation in (x||F).

Hence we have: 

(q&(x&F))

The x&F become F because of the law 6.

(T | !F)  - We know that the ""!F"" is actually True, so the expression is equivalent to ""True or True"", which will return True.

Becomes:

4. By applying the associativity rule of OR operation which says A | (B | C) equals (A | B) | C equals A | B | C, we have (j|j|j). 

5. The OR operation is idempotent which means A | A equals A. Hence, (j|j|j) simplifies to just j.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we'll simplify the smallest repeated combinations possible:

((F&(m&F))|T) - This simplifies to T(reason: F & anything is always F, because it requires both values to be true but F is always false. Therefore the other side of the logical disjunction (or) dominates and this expression simplifies to T).

(!T) - This simplifies to F.

(F|T) - This simplifies to T.

So replacing the above in the given expression:

(!(((x|((((k|(F))|F)|k)|(!(n&(p&T))))))&T)|T).

Now, simplifying F&x to F and ((F)|k) and the other terms gives:

(!(((x|(((k)|k)|(!(n&p))))&T)|T).

Now, simplify the (k|k) it remains k:

(!(((x|(k|(!(n&p))))&T)|T).

The right side of expression is not useful anymore, because anything disjuncted with T is always true. Hence, we remain with the left side of the expression as:

!(((x|(k|(!(n&p))))&T).

3. T&F simplifies to F. This is because 'and' operation with False always results in False.
4. T&T simplifies to T. This is because 'and' operation with True always results in True.
5. !F simplifies to T. This is because 'not' operation switches the boolean value, and 'not' False is True.

1. (T|F) simplifies to T.
2. (s|F) simplifies to s.

1. (F|T) simplifies to T. 
2. (T|F) simplifies to T.

Next, we can simplify `F|(!(T|((!F)|F)))` to `F|(!T)`, because regardless of what the outcome of `((!F)|F)` is, it wouldn't affect the Boolean result of `T|((!F)|F)`.

Then, since `(!(T))` is `F` and `F|F` is just `F`, we can now simplify the formula: `(r&((r&((r|r)|r))|(((F|F)|T)&F))`.

We can simplify this further by evaluating `T&F` as `F`. Knowing this, we get:

`(r&((r&((r|r)|r))|(F|F))`.

Next, because the result of `(r|r)` is `r`, the formula becomes:

`(r&((r&(r|r))|F))`.

Next, `r&r` would always be `r`, so the formula is now:

`(r&(r|F))`.
