A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, look at the operations involving constants T and F. 

More specifically, consider the following logical principles:

- !T = F: this is self-explanitive, the negation of True is False.

- T & F = F: any logical and operation where False is involved results in False.

- F | F = F: the disjunction (logical or operation) of two False values is False.

Using these principles, let's simplify:

(!T) | (T & F) simplifies to F | F which equals F. 

So the first term is: (z | F | z) simplifies to z | z which equals z.

The second part, (z & ((z & T) | F)), simplifies to (z & z) as z & T = z and F or anything equals the thing itself.

Therefore, the overall simplified expression is:

2. Simplify `((((F|T)&F)|((u|T)|T))&T)` expression. As you know, expression `(A|T)` always equal True, since if at least one value in `or` operation is True, it returns True. Therefore, `((((F|T)&F)|((u|T)|T))&T)` expression becomes `((T&F)|((T)|T))&T`. The `T&F` equals False, so the expression in brackets simplifies to `(F|(T))&T`, which simplifies to `T&T` and equals `T`.

        - ((F&T)|T) & ((F|F)&T) simplifies to F|T, which is T, because true or anything is always true.

Next we simplify (!T) to F because the not of true is false.

So, now the original logic formula is (i&T|F) | (T & c & F). 

(T & c & F) always gives F, because false and anything is always false.

Now, i&T|F simplifies to i&T, because T|F simplifies to T, and anything or false is just that thing.

Using these rules, we can simplify the expression. Let's start:

(((((n&(n&T))&T)&n)|n)|(((n|(o&(!T)))|F)|F))

According to the above rules (n&T) equals n and (o&(!T)) equals o, so:

((((n&n)&T)&n)|n)|((n|o)|F)

(n&n) equals n so:

((n&T)&n)|n)|((n|o)|F)

((n&T)&n) equals n, same with the rule (n&n) equals n:

n|n)|((n|o)|F)

This leads to n|((n|o)|F)

The expression ((n|o)|F) is equivalent to (n|o) same with the rule (A|F) equals A:

n|(n|o)

According to the distributive law, this simplifies to:

n|n|o

(n|n) equals n so the final simplified form is:

(!((x|x)&((!(T|(T&F)))&(F|((!T)|F))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting with the innermost brackets:

1- (!((x|x)&((!(T|(T&F)))&(F|((!T)|F))))
The logic operation ""or"" (|) is commutative: T|F is equivalent to F|T, so we can switch the order for our convenience. 

2- Then: (!((x|x)&((!(F|(T&T)))&((!T)|F|F))))
""T"" and ""F"" via ""and"" (&) always ends up with ""F"", so we can simplify (T&T) as T because T&T is equivalent to T and F&T is equivalent to F.

3- So our formula becomes: (!((x|x)&((!(F|T))&((!T)|F|F))))
""T"" or ""F"" is always ""T"". We can simplify (F|T) as T.

4- This results in: (!((x|x)&((!T)&((!T)|F|F))))
The logical not (!) inverts the value of ""T"", turning it into ""F"". Therefore, we can simplify (!T) as F.

5- So the formula now looks like this: (!((x|x)&(F&(F|F|F))))
""F"" and ""F"" via ""or"" (|) always ends up with ""F"". So we can simplify (F|F|F) as F.

6- So the formula now is: (!((x|x)&(F&F)))
""F"" and any other value via ""and"" (&) always ends up with ""F"". Therefore, we can simplify (F&F) as F.

7- This leads to the formula: (!((x|x)&F))
Again, ""F"" and any other value via ""and"" (&) always ends up with ""F"". Therefore, we can simplify ((x|x)&F) as F.

8- Finally, this gives us the formula: (!F)
The logical not (!) inverts the value of ""F"", turning it into ""T"". Therefore, we can simplify (!F) as T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify T&F to F.

The formula becomes: 
((!(((p|F)|((f&F)&F))&(p&F)))|((T&T)&T)).

Then, because anything OR'd with False returns the original value, the formula simplifies to:
((!((p|((f&F)&F))&(p&F)))|((T&T)&T)).

Next, f&F simplifies to F (Anything AND'd with False equals False), which simplifies the formula to:
((!((p|F)&(p&F)))|((T&T)&T)).

Again, anything OR'd with false returns the original value:
((!((p&F)))|((T&T)&T)).

Now, p&F simplifies to F (Anything AND'd with False equals False). Giving us:
((!(F))|((T&T)&T)).

!(F) simplifies to T (Not False is True):
(T|((T&T)&T)).

T&T simplifies to T. So we get:
(T|T&T).

(T|T).

Finally, anything OR'd with True is True. So the final simplified logical formula is:

So, both the parts inside (q|(((T|F)|T)&((o&T)|T))) turn into (q|T). This expression is also always True, because OR with True is always True.

So, (F&(Q|(((T|F)|T)&((o&T)|T))) becomes F&T which is False. Because AND with False is always False.

Finally, ((F|F)|T) simplifies to T, and then !((F|F)|T) simplifies to !T, which is False.

Aditionally, '!!any Boolean value' returns the original Boolean value, that is if B is a Boolean, then !!B = B

Then it simplifies to :
n or n --> n

Also, in ((v&(!T)) part, not T is False due to which the whole expression is dictated by it and become False, meaning all v become v&F (because anything AND False results in False).

The expression (False) | F is also False, because at least one of the values must be True for an OR operation to be True.

Therefore, (F&((F&T)|F)) is equal to False.

Consequently, e&(T|(F&((F&T)|F))) simplifies to e&(T|False), which is the same as e&T, which is simply e, as AND operation with True does not change the original value.

Let's look at the second part of the expression. (!(!(!F))) is equivalent to !(!True) which is equivalent to !False which is True.

Next, simplify the innermost expressions. We know that !F = T, T&(!F) = T&T = T and t&F = F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, the operation (g|g) is equivalent to g.
The operation (!p&F) is equivalent to F because ""not p"" and False result in False (for any value of p). Then it's multiplied with True, resulting in False.
The operation (F&T) results in False, because False and True is False.
This gives us a simplified formula: (g & ((false | F) | (F | (x & F)))).
Complex truths can be simplified further, as ""False or False"" results in False, and ""x and False"" results in False.
So the formula simplifies to: (g & (F | F)), which is just g & F.

((!(((y|(T&F))&T)|(T|((T&T)|T))))|(!(T|T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (T&F) results in F, because the logical ""and"" (represented by the ampersand symbol) returns True only when both conditions are True. When one of the conditions is False (as it is here), it returns False.
   Thus, the expression simplifies to ((!((y|F)&T)|(T|T)))|(!(T|T)).

2. Then, (y|F) simplifies to y because the logical ""or"" operation (represented by the vertical bar | ) returns True when at least one of the conditions is True. In this case, since y can be either True or False, the ""or"" operation will return y.
   Thus, the expression simplifies to not((y&T)|(T|T)) or not(T|T).

3. Now, y&T will just be y, and T|T will be T. So, we simplify the expression to ((!y|T)|F). 

4. In this scenario, the first part (!y|T) will always be T, because if y is True, !y is False and False or True is True. If y is False, !y is True and True or True is True. Thus, the expression simplifies to T|F.  

5. Finally, T|F translates into T, because ""or"" operation returns True if at least one of the operands is True.

So, the simplified result of the expression ((!(((y|(T&F))&T)|(T|((T&T)|T))))|(!(T|T))) is True or T.",T,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical formula can be simplified as follows:

We know that,

so,
False & F = False  (False and False is False)

Hence, this simplifies the nested part of the formula to,

Which simplifies to just b (b or False is just b)

Then substituting the next part,
(b | F) = b (b or False is b)
(b | b) = b (b or b is b)

So, ((b | ((b | F) | b)) & b) simplifies to just b 

So, overall the formula simplifies to b. Therefore,
