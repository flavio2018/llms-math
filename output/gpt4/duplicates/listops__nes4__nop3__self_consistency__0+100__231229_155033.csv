The expression simplifies to:
MIN 4 [MIN [MAX 8 8 2] [MAX 3 4 2] 8] [MIN 2 [MIN 4 5 2] [SM 1 2 2]]

Then, we perform the MAX operations in the brackets:

Next, find the MIN and MAX values for all lists:

MIN [9, 0] = 0.
MIN [7, 0] = 0.
MAX [9, 9, 0] = 9.

Substitute these values back into the expression, the problem then becomes:

Now, take the SM value:

SM [8, 8] = (8+8)%10 = 16%10 = 6.

Substitute this back into the expression, the problem then becomes:

We also have [MIN 2 7 7]. The minimum of 2, 7, 7 is 2. 

Then we have [SM 2 8], so we sum these numbers and take modulo 10, which would be (2+8)%10 = 10%10 = 0.

Next we have [SM 3 6 4], that is (3+6+4)%10 = 13%10 = 3.

So [SM 6 2 8] becomes (6+2+8)%10 = 16%10 = 6.  

Lastly [MAX 5 4 9], the maximum of 5, 4 and 9 is 9.

Similarly, [SM 8 6 7] equals 8 + 6 + 7 = 21, but SM gives us only 1.

[MAX 2 1 2] equals the maximum of 2, 1 and 2 which is 2.

[SM 0 3 5] equals 0 + 3 + 5 = 8.

First of all we need to evaluate the innermost expressions. In this case, they are the MAX, MIN and SM operations at the bottom level.

The expression [SM 3 1 8] results in 2, because the sum of 3 + 1 + 8 = 12, but it's modulo 10, so there's only 2 left.

The expression [MIN 9 6 6] results in 6, as 6 is the smallest of the three numbers.

The expression [MIN 5 2 8] results in 2, as 2 is the smallest among them.

The expression [MAX 0 8 0] results in 8, as 8 is the maximum among them.

The expression [MIN 8 7 2] results in 2, because 2 is the smallest of three numbers.

After these calculations, our expression becomes:

[MIN 6 [MAX 8 [MIN 8 5 2] [SM 6 4 1]] [SM 5 [MIN 0 2 [MIN 8 1 2]]]].

[MIN 8 5 2] becomes 2 because 2 is the smallest.

[SM 6 4 1] becomes 1 because 6 + 4 + 1 = 11, then modulo 10 leaves 1.

[MIN 8 1 2] becomes 1 because 1 is the smallest.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's start from the innermost brackets:

- In the brackets [SM 1 4 4], SM meaning sum modulo 10, the sum is 9
- In the brackets [MIN 8 0 3], MIN meaning minimum, the smallest number is 0
- In the brackets [SM 1 9 2], the sum is 2 (as 12 mod 10 equals 2)
- In the brackets [MAX 0 9 3], MAX meaning maximum, the largest number is 9
- In the brackets [MIN 8 [MAX 6 5 2] [MIN 6 7 1]], the maximum number among [6 5 2] is 6 and the minimum in [6 7 1] is 1, so, the minimum number in [8 6 1] is 1
- In the brackets [MAX 7 [SM 2 5 9] [SM 4 1 9]], the sum of [2 5 9] is 6 (as 16 mod 10 equals 6) and the sum of [4 1 9] is 4 (as 14 mod 10 equals 4). The maximum number in [7 6 4] is 7.

Hence, our expression has simplified to: 
[SM [SM 0 [MIN 9 0 3] [SM 2 9] 4 [MAX 1 7 5]].

Now, lets simplify further:

- In the brackets [MIN 9 0 3], the smallest number is 0.
- In the brackets [SM 2 9], the sum is 1 (as 11 mod 10 equals 1).
- In the brackets [MAX 1 7 5], the largest number is 7.

So, our statement now is: 
[SM [SM 0 0 1] 4 7].

Again, simplifying further:

- In the brackets [SM 0 0 1], the sum is 1.

Therefore, our final expression is:

[SM 4 6 8] = (4 + 6 + 8) modulo 10 = 18 modulo 10 = 8
[MAX 7 [SM 5 8 4] [MIN 6 0 6]] requires resolving [SM 5 8 4] = (5 + 8 + 4) modulo 10 = 17 modulo 10 = 7 and [MIN 6 0 6] = 0, hence [MAX 7 7 0] = 7

[MAX 2 2 8] = 8
[SM 8 5 9] = (8 + 5 + 9) modulo 10 = 22 modulo 10 = 2

Therefore, we have:

[MIN 4 [SM 3 [SM 7 1 8] 7] [MIN [MIN 1 8 0] [SM 9 8 2] 9]]

Applying remaining SM, MIN, and MAX operations:

[SM 7 1 8] = (7 + 1 + 8) modulo 10 = 16 modulo 10 = 6
[MIN 1 8 0] = 0
[SM 9 8 2] = (9 + 8 + 2) modulo 10 = 19 modulo 10 = 9

[MIN 5 0 3] = 0
[MIN 8 4 9] = 4
[MAX 8 0 6] = 8

Substitute these values back into the expression:

    So, Max of 4 and 1 is 4, and Max of 4 and 3 is 4 again
    Max of 5 and 4 is 5

In the brackets, we have,

    Modulo 10 of 10 is 0

[SM 9 [MAX [SM 1 0 1] [MIN 2 0 [SM 5 5 9]] 1] [SM 1 [MIN 9 6 7] [MIN 1 3 6]]]

Since SM is the sum modulo 10, solve the nested SM:

[SM 9 [MAX 2 [MIN 2 0 9] 1] 3 ] = [SM 9 [MAX 2 [MIN 2 0 9] 1] 3 ]

Replace the MIN
[SM 9 [MAX 2 0 1] 3 ] becomes [SM 9 [MAX 2 0 1] 3 ] which becomes [SM 9 2 3 ]

- [SM 1 0 8] = 9 (because the sum of 1, 0, and 8 is 9 which is lesser than 10 so no modulo operation required)
- [MIN 1 5] = 1

So, the formula becomes:
- [MIN [SM 4 6 5] [MIN 9 1 4] 6 2]

Now, we can simplify the SM and MIN operations:
- [SM 4 6 5] = 5 (because the sum of 4, 6, and 5 is 15 and the modulo of 15 is 5)
- [MIN 9 1 4] = 1

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the SM operator means that we add the values together and then take the sum modulo 10.

Step 1: [MAX 2 2 9] -> The maximum value here is 9.
[SM 2 0 2] -> We add the values ""2+0+2"" which gets ""4"".
[SM 6 7 9] -> We add ""6+7+9"" which gets ""22"", and 22 modulo 10 is equal to 2.
[SM 6 7 7] -> We add ""6+7+7"" which gets ""20"", and 20 modulo 10 is equal to 0. 
[MIN 9 2 5] -> The minimum value here is 2.
[SM 0 8 7] -> We add ""0+8+7"" which is ""15"", and 15 modulo 10 is equal to 5.
[MAX 1 4 9] -> The maximum value here is 9.

- [MIN 5 5 5]: all numbers are the same, so the minimum is 5.

- [MAX 8 7 5]: among 8, 7 and 5, 8 is the maximum.
- [MIN 6 1 6]: among 6, 1 and 6, 1 is the minimum.

Next, let's calculate the SM operator:

- [SM 9 8 3]: sum is 9+8+3=20, and 20 modulo 10 gives 0.
- [SM 0 0 8]: sum 8 would be within single-digit integers, so it remains 8.
- [SM 1 [SM 9 9 8] 7]: since 9+9+8 = 26 and 26 modulo 10 = 6, then, 1 + 6 + 7 = 14, and 14 modulo 10 is 4.
- [SM [SM 0 0 8] 4 5]: since the calculated SM 4 of the previous step and SM 8 are smaller than 10, then, 8 + 4 + 5 = 17, and 17 modulo 10 is 7.

- [MAX 1 2 3] = 3, since 3 is the maximum value among 1, 2, and 3.
- [MIN 3 1 7] = 1, since 1 is the minimum value among 3, 1, and 7.

- [SM 5 0 6] = (5 + 0 + 6) modulo 10 = 11 modulo 10 = 1, since the sum modulo 10 of the list [5, 0, 6] is 1.

After these simplifications, the expression becomes:

[MAX [MIN 2 3 0] [MAX 6 3 1]] [MIN [MAX 8 0 0] 0 1] 5].

Continuing on the same way:

- [MIN 2 3 0] = 0, since 0 is the minimum value among 2, 3, and 0.
- [MAX 6 3 1] = 6, since 6 is the most significant number among 6, 3, and 1.

Substitute these values back into the original expression:

[MIN [SM 1 [MAX 8 8 5] [MIN [MAX 9 0 3] [SM 8 2 5] 2]] 3 [MIN [MAX 4 4 5] [SM 0 4 6] 7]]

Again solve for the innermost brackets:

[MAX 8 8 5] = 8
[SM 8 2 5] = (8+2+5) mod 10 = 5
[SM 0 4 6] = (0+4+6) mod 10 = 0

Substitute these values back into the expression:

[MIN [SM 1 8 [MIN [MAX 9 0 3] 5 2]] 3 [MIN [MAX 4 4 5] 0 7]]

Keep solving for the innermost brackets:

[MIN [MAX 9 0 3] = 9
[MIN [MAX 4 4 5] = 4
[SM 1 8 9] = (1+8+9) mod 10 = 8

Substitute these back into the expression:

- MAX [MAX 2 8 2] = 8
- SM [SM 9 9 4] = 2 (9+9+4 = 22, 22 modulo 10 is 2)
- MAX [MAX 6 5 5] = 6
- SM [SM 3 1 4] = 8 (3+1+4 = 8, 8 modulo 10 is 8)

- SM 5 5 5 adds to 15, but since we get the sum modulo 10, it results in 5
- MAX 1 5 9 returns 9
- MAX 6 9 4 returns 9
- SM 9 3 9 adds to 21, modulo 10 returns 1
- MAX 2 7 0 returns 7
- SM 9 6 0 adds to 15, modulo 10 returns 5
- SM 9 9 1 adds to 19, modulo 10 returns 9

Substitute these values to get the following:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to simplify the interior of the expression:

- [SM 9 4 0] is the sum of 9, 4, 0 modulo 10. The sum is 13, and 13 modulo 10 is 3.
- [MAX 6 4 3] gives the maximum of 6, 4, 3, which is 6.
- [SM 3 4 4] is the sum of 3, 4, 4 modulo 10. The sum is 11, and 11 modulo 10 is 1.
- [MAX 4 7 1] gives the maximum of 4, 7, 1, which is 7.
- [MAX 1 0 4] gives the maximum of 1, 0, 4, which is 4.
- [MIN 7 4 9] gives the minimum of 7, 4, 9, which is 4.
- [MAX 0 4 2] gives the maximum of 0, 4, 2, which is 4.
- [MAX 6 4 5] gives the maximum of 6, 4, 5, which is 6.

Substitute these values back into the original expression:

[ MAX 0 [MIN [MIN 3 6 3] [MIN 1 7 3] 4] [SM [SM 4 4 6] [MAX 4 6 2] 8] ].

Next, inside each bracket, compute the MIN and MAX:

- [MIN 3 6 3] gives the minimum of 3, 6, 3, which is 3.
- [MIN 1 7 3] gives the minimum of 1, 7, 3, which is 1.
- [SM 4 4 6] is the sum of 4, 4, 6 modulo 10. The sum is 14, and 14 modulo 10 is 4.
- [MAX 4 6 2] gives the maximum of 4, 6, 2, which is 6.

Replace these results in the expression:

Continue with processing:

- [SM 4 6 8] is the sum of 4, 6, 8 modulo 10. The sum is 18, and 18 modulo 10 is 8.

[MAX [MAX 3 5 5] [MAX 1 5 4] 0]

Further calculate the maximum operations:
