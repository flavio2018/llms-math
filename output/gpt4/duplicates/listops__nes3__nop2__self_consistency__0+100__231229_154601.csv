Continue to solve the expressions in brackets. [SM 8 4] gives 2, because 8+4=12 and we take 12 modulo 10, which results in 2. [SM 9 3] gives 2, because 9+3=12 and 12 modulo 10 gives 2.
Now the expression looks like this: [SM 1 [SM 2 2]].

Then, [SM 2 2] gives 4. 
Now the expression looks like this: [SM 1 4].

Finally, [SM 1 4] gives 5, because 1+4 equals 5. So, the answer to the original expression is 5.",5,5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the innermost operations:

[SM 5 0] results in a 5 because sum modulo 10 of 5 and 0 is 5.
[MIN 3 5] results in a 3 because the minimum of 3 and 5 is 3.
[SM 0 2] results in a 2 because sum modulo 10 of 0 and 2 is 2.
[SM 5 8] results in a 3 because sum modulo 10 of 5 and 8 is 13, and 13 modulo 10 equals 3.

So the expression now is: [SM [MIN 5 3] [SM 2 3]].

Next, proceed with the remaining operations:

[MIN 5 3] results in a 3 because the minimum of 5 and 3 is 3.
[SM 2 3] results in a 5 because sum modulo 10 of 2 and 3 is 5.

Now, let's solve the [MAX 2 0] and [MAX 5 3] operations. The maximum between 2 and 0 is 2, and the maximum between 5 and 3 is 5.

So, [SM [SM 4 6] [MAX [MAX 2 0] [MAX 5 3]]] becomes [SM [SM 4 6] [MAX 2 5]].

The next step is to solve the [MAX 2 5] operation, which results is 5. Thus, [SM [SM 4 6] [MAX 2 5]] becomes [SM [SM 4 6] 5].

Then, we solve the [SM 4 6] operation. The sum modulo 10 of 4 and 6 is 0.

Therefore, [SM [SM 4 6] 5] becomes [SM 0 5], which, finally, results is 5.

Next, inside the second MAX operator, we perform the SM operation on 4 and 5, getting 9 (since the sum of 4 and 5 equals 9) and compare it with 7 (which is the result of MAX 7 7). The maximum of 9 and 7 is 9.

Finally, we perform the outer most SM operation on 1 (the result from the first set of operations) and 9 (the result from the second set of operations), giving us 10.  But again, it is SM operation, so we again take the remainder of 10 divided by 10, which gives us 0.
