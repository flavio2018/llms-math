For [MAX 2 1 7], the maximum number among 2, 1, and 7 is 7.

Similarly, for [MAX 2 1 8], the maximum number amongst 2, 1, and 8 is 8.

So the equation now becomes [MIN 7 8 3].

Then, looking at ""MIN 7 8 3"", the minimum among 7, 8, and 3 is 3.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the value of the innermost SM operations, SM 9 9 4 and SM 2 1 2. 

For SM 9 9 4, we add all the numbers 9+9+4 = 22. Modulo 10 of the result is 2 (remains after the division by 10).

For SM 2 1 2, the sum is 2+1+2 = 5. The modulo 10 of 5 is 5 itself (as it's already less than 10).
