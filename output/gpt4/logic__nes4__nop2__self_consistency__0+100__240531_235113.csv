1. The expression k&k is logically equivalent to just k, so the formula can be rewritten as:

2. Rules of Boolean algebra dictate that anything ANDed with F (False) equals F. So, (k&F) simplifies to F, going down to:

   ((F&F)|(((g|F)&F)|F))

3. Further apply the same rule of anything ANDed with False equals False, so (F&F) simplifies to F and ((g|F)&F) simplifies to F too, giving us:

For '&', the result will only be true if both elements are true.
'!' is simply a negation.

Let's apply these rules to the formula:

We start by applying the logical 'or' rule to 'q|F' which simplifies to just 'q' since anything 'or' false is just the value of the variable.

In the same manner, '|F' can be dropped from the formula, as 'or false' doesn't change the logic of the statement.

So (((q|F)|q)|F)|(q&((q&q)&q)) can be simplified to (q|q)|(q&((q&q)&q)).

But q or q is just q, because a variable or itself is again the variable. So, we simplify this to q | (q & (q&q & q)).

- Now, simplify (T|False). ""Or"" operation returns true if any one operand is true. Since one is true here, it would return true. Hence the equation now becomes ((T|!T)&T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider the term (a&T). This term will simply be evaluated as 'a' because 'a' AND 'True' is just 'a' (since anything AND 'True' retains its original value). So, (a&(a&T)) simplifies to (a&a), which further simplifies to simply 'a'.

Next, consider ((!F)&T). Logical not (!) of 'False' (F) is 'True' (T) because '!F' means 'not False' which is 'True'. Thus (!F) changes to (T). Hence, this term becomes (T&T), which simplifies to 'T' because anything AND itself is always itself.

Then, the full equation with these simplifications looks like:
!(a|T).

Now, 'a' OR 'True' (a|T) is always 'True'. If 'a' is 'False', 'False' OR 'True' will be 'True'. If 'a' is 'True', 'True' OR 'True' will also be 'True'. Hence, the formula becomes !True.
