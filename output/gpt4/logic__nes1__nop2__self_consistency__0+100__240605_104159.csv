0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical OR operator (|) results in True if either of the operands (both sides of the operator) is True. Here we have:
(h|T)

Since T is True, it doesn't matter whether h is True or False. The statement (h|T) as a whole will always end up being True. 

Simplified form: T",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","""F|T"" means ""False OR True"". And in logical terms, False OR True results in True. So, the simplified logic formula is ""T"".",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula (v&T) signals that value v and True (T) are under logical AND operation. In a logical AND operation, the result is true if and only if both operands are true. 

Since T is always True, the result will simply be the value v.

Hence, the simplified form of logic formula is v.",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that 'F' represents 'False'. 
We also know that any value 'X' OR 'False' will result in 'X', because 'False' will not change the value when used with an OR operation. 
Therefore, (o|F) simplifies to 'o'.",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical operator ""or"" (represented by ""|"") outputs true if at least one of its operands (i.e., the values being operated on) is true. If we look at the expression, we have (q|F), or in other terms, q OR False. This means that the expression will be true if q is True OR if False is true. 

However, we know that False is, by definition, not true. Therefore, the expression actually simplifies to just depend on whether q is true or not. If q is true, then the whole expression is true. If q is false, then the whole expression is false too.

Hence, the expression (q|F) simplifies to just q.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical AND operation (&) gives True if and only if both operands are True. In this case, the operands are f and F (False). Since False AND anything is still False, the simplified form of this logic formula is simply F (False).",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","""AND"" operation holds true if both of its inputs are true. In this case, both inputs are ""w"". Which simply means this is equivalent to ""w"". So the simplified form of the given logic formula is ""w"".",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical or ""|"" operation between any value and ""False"" (""F"") will result in the value itself. This is because ""or"" operation is satisfied when at least one of its operand is ""True"". In this case, for ""b|F"" to be true, ""b"" must be true as ""F"" is definitely false. 

So, the simplified form of the logic formula ""(b|F)"" will be ""b"".",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (o|o) means that it is true if at least one o is true. Since these are the same elements, if one is true, the other is also true, and if one is false, the other is also false. So, this expression can be simplified to just o.",o,o
