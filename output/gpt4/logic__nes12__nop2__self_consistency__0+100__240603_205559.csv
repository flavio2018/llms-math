(!T) is False.
(!F) is True.
T&T is True.
F|T is True.
F&T is False.
T|T is True.

With these simplifications, let's rewrite the whole statement:

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|False)|True))|(w&False)))&T)|w))&((w&((F|True)|T))|w))&(F|T)))

(w & (((w | (((w|((w|True))|False)))&T)|w) & ((w&(True|T))|w) & True))

Simplify again:

(w & (((w | (w | True))|False)&T) & ((w&True)|w) & True)

This simplifies to:

(w & ((w | True) & T) & w & True)

We know (w or True) will always be True, the statement now simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we have logical not (!) which essentially inverts the value of anything it is before. It turns True (T) into False (F) and vice versa. So !F becomes T and !T becomes F. 

Second, we have logical or (|), which returns True if at least one of the arguments is True. This means that a lot of the nested conditions in your expression can be simplified, because whenever we see T|X, where X can be T or F or a more complex expression, the result will always be T. 

Third, we have logical and (&), which returns True only if both arguments are True. So a statement like T&X, where X can be T or F or a more complex expression, will return the value of X. 

Here’s how to reduce your expression, step by step:

(((!F)|F)|((((!((((F&(!(F&(d|T))))&F)&(!((F&(T|(T|F)))|F)))|T))|(!((T|T)|F)))|(!T))|F))

Given the fact that any value OR-ed with itself remains itself, then (v|v) simplifies to v, and (l|l) simplifies to l, therefore (l|(l|(l|l))) simplifies to l.

Moreover, l OR-ed with FALSE equals l, thus ((l|(F&F)|F)) simplifies to l, and ((l|F)|((l|l)&T))|l) simplifies to l.

Also, not TRUE (!T) equals FALSE (F), and any value AND F equals F, so T & F simplifies to F. Hence, (!T & F) simplifies to F, and (!o & (b & F)) simplifies to F.

Step 2: (T|(!T)) is a tautology as it is always true, because either T is true or T is not true. This means (!(T|(!T))) is always false, because the negation of a tautology is always false.

Step 3: (F&((!(T|(!T)))&T)) is thus equal to F, because any statement and a false is always false.

Step 4: (b&T)&b is equivalent to b, because for the statement to be true, b must be true, hence we can simplify it to b.

Step 5: (l|l) is equivalent to l, because a statement or the same statement is equivalent to the original statement.

Step 6: (t&F) and (f&F) are equivalent to F, because any statement and false is always false.

Step 7: (r&r)&(((l|l)|(t&F))&(f&F))) is equivalent to r, because the expression after & simplifies to f&F, which is always false.

Step 8: Thus, (!((!(((r&r)&(((l|l)|(t&F))&(f&F)))&F))|T)) is equivalent to T, because the expression is simplified to (!(F|T)) which is always true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First simplify the innermost parentheses and &T, |T and |F parts: 

In any logic formula: 
- multiplying anything by True (a&T) or adding anything with False (a|F) results in the original value (a).
- adding anything with True (a|T) results in True.
- multiplying anything by False (a&F) results in False.

Therefore ((e&((e&e)&T))|F) simplifies to e&e&e 
which simplifies to e. 

Similarly, (((u&u)|(F&T))&(!T)) simplifies to (u|False)&False
which simplifies to False.

2. Replacing the simplified parts back in the formula results in: 

((m|e|T)&((i&(!(F&(m&False))&T))&F)) 

3. Simplifying this gives:

((m|e|T)&(i&(!F)&T&F))

4. Simplifying further:

2. (F&F) and (F&T) are both always False whereas (e&T) is simply e, so the expression simplifies to:

   (((d&(T&(T&((T|((F|(F&e)))|(T&F)))))&(!F)))|F)&((d|(F&F))&T)).

3. Furthermore, (F|(F&e)) is just F or e. 

    (((d&(T&(T&((T|e)|F))))&T)|F)&((d|F)&T).

4. (T&e) is e and (T&F) is F, so we simplify further:

Thirdly, for the logical OR operator (|), it is known that T|F = T, F|T = T, F|F = F and T|T = T.

Now, let's simplify:

2. F&F equals F, and T&T equals T, so, the formula further simplifies to:

3. (k|F) equals k, so the formula simplifies to:

2. Inside ((((x&(((((x|x)|x)&T)&(x|(x&(T|F))))|F))&(!(T&(!F)))))|(!T)),

Then we can simplify (((d|d)&t)|T) by removing repetitive d variables, that becomes (d&t)|T that is always T.
Hence, we get ((d&d)|(T|F)&(d&((d&T)|d)))|(F|F)).
Seeing that T|F is always T, so the statement becomes ((d&d)|T)&(d&(((d&T)|d)|F)).
After that (d&T)|d becomes d and (((d&T)|d)|F) becomes d.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The first simplification can be done by replacing multiple occurrences of a same variable using AND operator by a single occurrence of that variable. Therefore, ((c&T)&c) simplifies to ""c"".

2. Since True OR anything = True and True AND anything = anything, simplifications can be made in the following subexpressions:

   a) T|(F|(T&(j|T))) simplifies to ""T"".

   b) (i|(i&(i|i))) simplifies to ""i"".

   c) ((i|T)|F) simplifies to ""T"".

   d) (T&T) simplifies to ""T"".

4. Then any expression OR True = True, using this fact (k|T) simplifies to ""T"".

5. Also, NOT True = False and NOT False = True. Therefore !T simplifies to ""F"" and !F simplifies to ""T"".

6. Finally, any expression AND False = False, using this fact (F&T) simplifies to ""F"".

Putting all these together the given logic formula simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we simplify any operation that involves 'not' (!), 'and' (&), and 'or' (|) with True (T) and False (F).

Because:
- T & F = F
- F & T = F
- T | F = T
- F | T = T
- !T = F
- !F = T

Now, applying these laws, 

1. (!(!(t&F))) becomes !(t&F) because double negation of a statement is equivalent to the statement itself. 

2. !(t&F) becomes !F because 't' & 'F' = 'F'. Hence, the entire expression becomes !F where !F = T.

Now our expression looks like this:
((F|(!(T|(F|(T|T&T|F)))))|(!((F|T&F|T)&F)|T)).

3. Simplifying (T|T&T|F), it becomes T as ""T OR T"" and ""T AND T"" both yield T, ""T NOR F"" also yields T.

Now our expression looks like this:
((F|(!(T|(F|T))))|(!((F|T&F|T)&F)|T)).

4. Simplifying ((F|(!(T|(F|T))))), since ""T OR F"" and ""T OR T"" both yield T, the whole expression becomes (F|!T) and !T is equal to F.

Now our expression looks like this:
((F|F)|(!((F|T&F|T)&F)|T)) = F|(!((F|T&F|T)&F)|T).

5. Finally, in (!((F|T&F|T)&F)|T) since ""F OR T"" and ""T AND F"" both yield T and F respectively and the whole expression becomes F&F which results in F.

Then, the formula becomes `(((t|((i&T)|T)|T))|T)&True)` .

`(((t|'T')|T))|T)&True`, as such 't' would be replaced with 'T'.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider any logic operation concerning ""F"". For logical AND, anything AND with ""F"" becomes ""F"". For logical OR, anything OR with ""F"" is itself. For logical NOT, the opposite logic value of ""F"" is ""T"". The below operations would take place:

1. ""F& ANYTHING"" would become ""F"".
   - (F & (p &F)) = F
   - (F & T) = F
   - F & ANYTHING = F

2. ""ANYTHING | F"" would return ""ANYTHING"".
   - (n | F) = n
   - (F | F) = F
   - ((F & T) | F) = F

3. ""!(F | T)"" would return ""!T"" = ""F"".

Thus, the original complex logic formula can be simplified as:

- ((F & F) & (T | (F & F))).

Then, simplify further:

- (F & (T | F) = (F & T) = F.

So, the given logic formula simplifies to ""F"".",F,F

Now let's look at the first inner expression `T&(!(((((F&T)|F)|T)&(((((F&(T|(F|T)))&F)&((g|((c|T)|T))&T))&F)|F))&(!T))`.
- Because `T|(F|T)` = `T|T` = `T`, the above can be simplified to `T&(!(((((F&T)|F)|T)&(((((F&T)&F)&((g|(c|T))&T))&F)|F))&(!T))`.
- Then, because `F&T == F`, the above can be simplified to `T&(!((F|T)&((F&((g|(c|T))&T))&F)&(!T)))`.
- After that, due to `F|T == T` and `F&X == F`, we get `T&(!(T&(!T)))`, which further simplifies to `T&(!F) == T&T == T`.

The second inner expression `n|(T|F)` can be simplified to `n|T == T` as `T|X` is `T` for any X. But because `T&X` is `X` for any X, we get the final simplification of the formula equals to `T`.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Simplify T&(!((f|(!(w|(F|T))))&F): Since anything OR-ed with false (F) gets back itself, (F|T) = T. So the expression simplifies to T&(!(f|(!w))&F). 
Again anything AND-ed with false (F) is false. So T&F gives F. Hence, the original expression simplifies to c&T = c, because true AND any logical value is that value itself.

2. Simplify c|(c&(c&(!(!(!(((z|F)&T)&F))): Again applying the same rules, (z|F) simplifies to z, (((z|F)&T)&F) simplifies to F, (!(!F)) simplifies to F and (c&(!(!F)) simplifies to c&F, which further simplifies to F, because anything AND-ed with F gives F. So, c|F simplifies to c.

3. Thus, the original expression simplifies as follows: (((c&c)|F)|(c|F))|(!F) -> (c|F)|(!F) -> c|F -> c, because true NOT-ed gives false, any logical value OR-ed with false gets back itself and lastly, any logical value OR-ed with F gives back the logical value itself.

((e&T)|(T|T)) simplifies to ((e&T)|T)

2. A logical AND with True does not change the other operand's value( & T does nothing)

3. T or any statement is always True( |T is always True), So, e|T is just T.

4. The NOT operator switches the values of True and False, so !T is F.

2. Next, F or T simplified into T in the inner braces as well as F or T is T and then T or anything is true, so (F|T) simplifies to T.
Hence, (F|(F|T)) simplifies to T.
Now, the formula becomes: ((((z&T)|z)|z)&z)&((T|(T&(!(F|(T|((T|((o|(!F))|((q&q)|T)))&F))))))|F)).

3. Now, z and T simplifies to z. And as something or itself is that thing.
So, ((z&T)|z) simplifies to z.
Our formula becomes: ((z|z)&z)&((T|(T&(!(F|(T|((T|((o|(!F))|((q&q)|T)))&F))))))|F)).

4. As said before, z or z simplifies to z. Anything and itself is that thing itself.
Thus, (z|z)&z simplifies to z.
The formula is now: z&((T|(T&(!(F|(T|((T|((o|(!F))|((q&q)|T)))&F))))))|F)).

5. Next, F or T simplify to T. Then, T and not anything simplify to false because T and F are False.

2. F | (m&m) = m (since anything OR False is equivalent to itself).
3. F | ((m&m)|(F|T)) = T (since anything OR True is True).
4. b & (F | ((m&m)|(F|T))) = b & T = b (since anything AND True is equivalent to itself).
5. b & F = F (since anything AND False is False).
6. ((b & (F | ((m&m)|(F|T))) & F) = F (result from step 5).
7. !F = T (not False is True).
8. T | T = T (True OR anything is always True).
9. t | (T | (T & !F)) = T (result from step 8).
10. ((b & (F | ((m&m)|(F|T))) & F) & (t | (T | (T & !F)))) = F & T = F (anything AND False is False).
11. !(!((b & (F | ((m&m)|(F|T))) & F) & (t | (T | (T & !F))))) = !F = T (result from step 7).
12. F | !T = F (False OR anything is always False).
13. T & (F | (c & (F&F))) = T & F = F (anything AND False is False).
14. F | T = T (False OR anything is always True).
15. T & ((F | (c & (F&F))) | T = T & T = T (True AND anything is always True).
16. !T = F (not True is False).

So,

1. T & !(F | (!(!(((b & (F | ((m&m) | (F | T))) & F) & (t | (T | (T & !F))))))) = T & T = T (True AND anything is always True).
2. !(T & ((F | (c & (F&F))) | T)) = F (result from step 16).

Hence, the original Logic formula simplifies to `T & F = F` (anything AND False is False).",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F | anything = 'anything' and T & anything = 'anything'. This is because true is an identity with respect to and-operation and false is an identity with regard to or-operation. Hence, we can omit all the T and F, which are directly combined with literals via & and | respectively. Thus, the logic formula becomes:
    (((n|F)&n)&(h|(((F|(o&((o&o))&F)&T))|(!((F|(F&(((F|(F|F))|((F|F))&T)&T)&T)))|F))).

2. Then we know that !F = T, and anything | T = T. So, (!F) anywhere in the formula can be replaced by T, and that can be further replaced by a redundancy and eliminated. This brings the logic formula to:
    (((n|F)&n)&(h|(((F|(o&((o&o))&F)&T)))).

3. Furthermore, a & a = a or a | a = a, because anything and-ed or or-ed with itself is just itself. So, any duplicated literals can be shortened to just one. This brings the formula to:
    ((n&n)&h).

4. Then we can apply the step 3 again the final logic formula is:

1. (!F) can be simplified to T, 
2. ((T|(T|T))) can be simplified to T, 
3. (F & F) can be simplified to F, 
4. (F & T) can be simplified to F.
5. ((v|((v&v)|F)) can be simplified to (v|v) which is just v

Substituting these simplifications into the formula:
    ((T)&(((a|F)|(a&T)&(f|(!(v&((x&T)&x)&(!F)))))&F)). 

6. (a & T) simplifies to a
7. (x & T) simplifies to x
8. (!F) simplifies to T
9. (a | F) simplifies to True or can be written as T

The simplified form becomes: 
    (T & ((T|a)&(f|!(v&x&T)))&F).

The last simplification is removing T, because (T & Expr) always equals to Expr, if T was F in this operation the overall value would be F, but there's a (Expr & F) at the end, so the overall expression is F. The simplification yielded F.

 !(T&F) simplifies to T because T&F is F, so !F is T.
 (!T) is F because the opposite of T (F) is F.

2) Replace these in the formula:

 ((n|(F&(f|(T&(!((F&F)|F)|(F&F))))))&(n&((F|(F|T))|T)))|(F))&(d|T).

3) Let's reduce the formula some more:

 F&(f|(T&(!F|F))) trivially simplifies to F because anything AND False equals False.

 ((F|(F|T))|T) simplifies to T because the or operation with at least one True equals True.

 Therefore, the formula can be reduced to:

 (n&F)&(n&T)|(F)&(d|T), which still can be further simplified.

4) Further simplification will result in:

 F&(n&T)|F, because anything AND False equals False; and

 F&(d|T), because it doesn't matter what (d|T) is: AND operation with False results in False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, it should be noted that in logic:
- The operation ""THING1 | F"" is always equivalent to ""THING1"", and ""THING1 & T"" is always equivalent to ""THING1"".
- Also, ""THING1 | T"" is always ""T"", and ""THING1 & F"" is always ""F"".
- Additionally, ""THING1 | THING1"" or ""THING1 & THING1"" is always equivalent to just ""THING1"".

Now, simplifying your expression:

1. ((e & (T|F)) & (!((!((u | (u | (F & ((T & ((T|F) & F)) | T)))) | T)) & (a | (T | (F | (F & ((s | (((k|F) | F) | T)) & F))))))) means
2. (e & (!((! (u | F)) & a)) because according to what we mentioned (T | F) = T, (T & F) = F, any THING1 or T is always T, and THING1 and F is always equivalent to F.

However, it can be simplified further:
3. (e & (!((!u) & a)) because u | F is always equivalent to u),

and then finally,
4. (e & ((!u) | !a)) because of De Morgan's law, explaining that !(P & Q) equals (!P | !Q).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to understand several basic laws of logical operations:

1. The law of idempotence: p & p = p (logical and) and p | p = p (logical or), where p is any propositional variable.
2. Boolean laws: True & p = p, False & p = False, True | p = True, False | p = p.
3. Negation laws: !True = False, !False = True.

((g&g)&((b|(b|(u|(h|(T))|!v)|T)|((T&True)|F))|False)).

Let's simplify again. T&True is T and (True)|F is True. We can also simplify True|p to True which leads us to:

- (!((F&T)|(T&T))) can be simplified to False because the expression inside the negation is True.
- From the above steps, we can simplify (!(F&((((z|z)|T)&F)&((!((F&T)|(T&T)))|T)))) to !(F&False), which is always True.

3) We know that T & A = A. This is because anything AND true is just itself.
4) We know that T | A = T. This is because anything OR true results in true.

6) We know that !T = F. This is because not true is false.

This simplifies further (using the properties that anything OR true equals true, and anything AND false equals false) to:

3. Therefore, (T&((((q|F)&((q|(q|F))|(q|q)))|q)|(!(!T)))) becomes (T&q), as any variable OR'ed with false or itself stays the same and True AND any variable is the variable itself.

! -> logical NOT
& -> logical AND
| -> logical OR

For logical NOT:
!T = F
!F = T

For logical AND:
T & T = T
T & F = F
F & T = F
F & F = F

For logical OR:
T | T = T
T | F = T
F | T = T
F | F = F

Based on these principles:

1. Any AND (&) operation with F results in F.
2. Any OR (|) operation with T results in T.

So:
F&T = F
T&F = F
T|(w&F) = T
F|T = T

Substituting these in the formula, it simplifies to: 

((c|(F&C))&((c&T)&T))

5: ((T&(T&T))&T)|False becomes T|False which is only T.
6: ((F&T)|T) becomes (F|T) since anything AND with False is False, which is T, because anything OR with True is True.
7: So this part (((T&(T&T))&T)|((F&T)|T)) becomes T.
8: (T&T) is T, hence (s|T) is always T because anything OR with True is True.
9: The whole part (T&((s|T)|T)&(T&(((((T&(T&T))&T)|(!((T|F)|T)))|F)|((F&T)|T)))) simplifies to T, as there are multiple T's ANDed together.

4. ""F&false"" => false (applies the same rule as above)

So, (((T|(F|(T|(T|((F|F)&(F&T))))))&F) simplifies to false.

Second, we can simplify (F|(T|T)) to True, because False or True is True.

Next, consider (!(F|(T|T))), which simplifies to !(True), which is False, since !True is False.

Then, we have (f|(F&(T|((x|x)&(F&T)))))&(T&(!(F|(T|T)))), which simplifies to f&False, because something and False is False. And &F also results in False, then (h|F)&h) is h, because something or False is that something.

Continuing simplifying, ((((h|F)&h)&T)&T)&F simplifies to F and (T&(((!((f|(F&(T|((x|x)&(F&T)))))&(T&(!(F|(T|T))))))&F)|F) simplifies to F.

So, the whole logic formula ((q|(((((h|F)&h)&T)&T)&F))|((T&(((!((f|(F&(T|((x|x)&(F&T)))))&(T&(!(F|(T|T))))))&F)|F))&T) simplifies to (q|F)|(F&T), which simplifies further to q|F, because something and True is that something.

- T&!F = True (both parts are True, and & operator is logical and, so True and True is True)
- !(T&!F) = False (it's logical not of True, so the answer is False)
- T|T = True (| operator is logical or, so True or True is True)
- F|!True, combining it with the above, = True
- T&!False & F = False (T&True = T, and T & F = False)
- T|False = True
- n|T = True

Replacing these in the original expression yields:

2. Then continue simplifying:

3. Then approximate:


((((e|e)|(x&(y|T)|0|x|F)&F)&(!T))&(T)).


4. Now, remember that T&F = F, T|F = T, and that anything OR-ed with False retains its original value, so this simplifies down to:

5. Observing parts of the expression that are AND-ed with F and will always be False:


((e|F)&(!T))&(T)).

((T&T)|((f|F)&((!(T|(T|(((((!T)&F)&T)&(s|(((u|F)|(!F))|F)))&(F|F)))))&((!(T&(T&F)))&T)))).

Firstly, charting through the optional logical operations: 

- We know that T & T = T (since ‘and’ requires both conditions to be true)
- The expression (!T) changes True to False and vice versa. Hence, !T = F. 
- Therefore, (((!T)&F)&T) becomes ((F&F)&T) which results in (F&T), and this ultimately equals to F (since one condition is False)
- For any values  s, u, F and !F  's|(((u|F)|(!F))|F)' would always be True because ‘or’ requires at least one condition to be true, and we have T or F or s or u.
- So, any expression that 'or's with True would equal True, i.e., T.
- Now, for the expression F|F, we have two False conditions, so the output is F. 
- Then, T & F = F 

Next, replacing the above conclusions inside the given logic expression gives:

((T)|((f|F)&((!(T|(T|(F&T))))))&((!(T&F))&T)).
  
- Breaking down f|F gives us f (as F or f will be f in a boolean operation due to F being False).
- Simultaneously, T|(T|(F&T)) simplifies down to (T|T), which becomes T (as 'or'ing T with T is still T). 

Replacing these in the logical expression turns it to:

(T|f&(!T&T)).

- Notice that we have (!T&T), just as before, we have a False and a True condition being 'and'ed, hence, they result in False 

Therefore, keeps transforming the logic expression yields:

(T|f&F).
  
Here, anything 'and'ed with False is False. Thus, the logic expression transforms as:

(T|f). 

- This states that we have either True or f, but since True supersedes in an 'or' condition, the outcome is T.

3. The logical 'not' of F (False) is T (True). Hence, !(h&F) becomes T (since h&F can be at best, h, and at least, F. Its not becomes T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, it is important to state that the logical not operator (!) changes the truth value of whatever it is operating on, and the logical and operator (&) is only true if both operands are true. For the logical or operator (|) only one of the operands needs to be true, it means if either operand is true, the result is true.

1) The term T|F is always equal to T, since the expression is true when either of conditions is true.
2) !T is equal to F and !F is equal to T.
3) F&T and T&F are always equal to F because for a logical and (&) both of the arguments must be true.
4) F|another_term is always equal to another_term , because F or another term is just another_term (unless another term is also F, in which case it would then be F).
5) T&another_term is always equal to another_term , because T and another_term is just another_term.

So if we use the abovementioned substitution rules we can simplify the original formula to x&v&!y&T which further simplifies to x&v&!y (because T&another_term is always equal to another_term).",x&v&!y,F
96,logic,self_consistency,(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively.

(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any statement OR'd (|) with False (F) remains the same, thus ((w|(f&F)) reduces to (w|F) which further reduces to w. 

2. Any statement AND'd (&) with False (F) gives us False, thus (w|(f&F)) reduces to w.

3. Any statement OR'd (|) with True (T) gives us True, thus (q|(T|(T|T))) simplifies to T.

4. Any statement AND'd (&) with True (T) remains the same, so (!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T)) simplifies to !(T&T) which is equivalent to !T. This further simplifies to F since the negation of True is False.

5. Therefore, the whole w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T))))) simplifies to w&((F)|(u&T)) which is equivalent to w&((F)|T)) as (u|T) simplifies to T. This simplifies to w&T which is simply w. Thus, our expression until now is w | w.

6. Further, any statement OR'd (|) with F remains same and any statement OR'd (|) with T gives T. Hence (!(F|F))|F simplifies to (!F)|F which equals T as the negation of False is True.

7. The whole statement (((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)) simplifies to (w&w)&T | T. 

8. Any statement AND'd (&) with same statement remains the same and any statement OR'd (|) with T gives T. Thus, (w&w)&T | T simplifies to w&T | T. This further simplifies to T as any statement OR'd (|) with T gives T.

So, the final simplified expression is T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, any value is logically AND-ed with False results in False. Thus, any expression which is AND-ed with False can be directly simplified to False. Based on this rule, the formula simplifies to:

F & (T | (T & !((T & T) & F)) | F)

Next, we know that True AND-ed with True or True AND-ed with not False is always True. Thus, the formula simplifies further to:

F & (T | T | F)

Again, True OR-ed with anything (True or False) is true. Thus the above formula is simplified to:

F & T

Lastly, False AND-ed with True results in False. So, the final simplified logic formula is:

((y|(T&(((F&((!T)&T))|T)&F)))|(((F|((F&(F|((((o|o)|o)&F)&((!((F&F)&(F|T)))&F))))&T))&F)&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, it is clear that the ""F"" (False) term attached by ""&"" (And) makes the entire statement or element False. It's because anything AND False is False. So we can simplify elements such as ((F&((!T)&T))|T)&F), (((F&F)&(F|T)))&F and (((o|o)|o)&F) to F. Similarly, any element with T and F connected by OR ""|"" like (F|T) simplifies to T since anything OR True always ends up being True. 

Lets go through the formula step-by-step:

1) ((y|(T&(((F&((!T)&T))|T)&F)))|(((F|((F&(F|((((o|o)|o)&F)&((!((F&F)&(F|T)))&F))))&T))&F)&F))

Which simplifies to (in steps):

2) ((y|(T&F))|(F&F))

As we know anything AND False is False and anything AND True is True.

Let's simplify again:

3) ((y|F)|F)

And anything OR False simplifies to the original value itself. Which ultimately gets us:

4) y

So the simplified form is just y.",y,y
