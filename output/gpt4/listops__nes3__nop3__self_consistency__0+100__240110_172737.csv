Our expression now is [MIN 7 3 2].

Finally, let's solve outer MIN function:
[MIN 7 3 2] = minimum of 7, 3, and 2 = 2.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, it's important to clarify that the sum modulo 10 (SM) operator adds up all the numbers in the list and then takes the remainder when that sum is divided by 10. Meanwhile, the MIN operator selects the smallest number in the list. 

Now, we can solve the expression by breaking down each clause:

- [SM 1 4 7] will give us (1 + 4 + 7) modulo 10 = 12 modulo 10 = 2.

- [SM 5 8 0] will give us (5 + 8 + 0) modulo 10 = 13 modulo 10 = 3.

- We then have [SM 3 2 3], which can be solved as (3 + 2 + 3) modulo 10 = 8.

Then, [SM 9 8] will give us (9 + 8) modulo 10 = 17 modulo 10 = 7.

The first action to be performed on the right side of the equation is the following:

- [MIN 6 2 9] will give us 2 since it is the smallest number in the list.

- [MIN 2 0 7] will give us 0 since it is the smallest number in the list.

- We then have [MIN 2 0], which will be 0 as it is the smallest number between 2 and 0.

Finally, the expression would look like: [SM 7 0], and since we're adding 0 to 7, the result would be 7 modulo 10 = 7.

MIN 1 3 6 = minimum of 1, 3, and 6 = 1

MIN 5 7 0 = minimum of 5, 7, and 0 = 0

After replacing these results in the expression, we get:

The equation now looks like this: 
[SM [SM 6 5 0] [SM 8 3 [SM 4 3 7]] 5].

Next, we solve the innermost SM functions. SM adds the given numbers and takes the modulo 10 of the result. Thus, [SM 6 5 0] equals (6+5+0) modulo 10 = 11 modulo 10 = 1, and [SM 4 3 7] equals (4+3+7) modulo 10 = 14 modulo 10 = 4.

[MAX 6 [MAX 8 2 5] corresponds to the maximum of 6, 8, 2 and 5, which is 8.

Now let's calculate [SM 2 7 9]. SM stands for sum modulo 10, so we add together 2, 7 and 9 to get 18, then take 18 modulo 10 to get 8.

So the first part of our expression becomes [MAX 5 [MAX 8 8]].

Now let's tackle the second part. [MIN 5 5 4] corresponds to the minimum of 5, 5 and 4, which is 4. Similarly, [MIN 9 6 4] corresponds to the minimum of 9, 6 and 4, which is also 4.

So the second part of our expression becomes [MAX [4] 5 [4]]. The maximum of 4, 5 and 4 is still 5.

Now our expression is [MAX 5 [MAX 8 8] 5]. This becomes [MAX 5 [8] 5] which simplifies to [MAX 5 8 5].

- MIN of (4, 4, 7) is 4.

So, the simplified version of the array is [SM 9 [MAX 2 4 2] [MIN 8 2]], which further simplifies to [SM 9 4 2 9 4].

Next, solve for the SM operator. Since SM represents ""sum modulo 10"", we need to add these numbers together and then take the result modulo 10. The sum of 9, 4, 2, 9, and 4 is 28, and 28 mod 10 equals 8.

MAX 0 3 0 = max(0,3,0) = 3

Substitute these answers back into the original expression, we get:

Further solve inside brackets by:
MIN 6 4 = min(6,4) = 4
MIN 9 6 0 = min(9,6,0) = 0
SM 3 0 7 = (3+0+7)%10 = 0

Substitute these answers back, we get:
[MAX 4 0 0 5]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should solve the innermost brackets. 

1. [MAX 2 6 4] = 6 (6 is the maximum number out of 2, 6, and 4)
2. [MIN 1 1 1] = 1 (1 is the minimum number, and all the numbers are 1s)

The resulting expression is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the innermost brackets. 
For [SM 8 6 4], it represents the sum (modulo 10) of 8, 6 and 4.
For the modulo operation, you take the result of division (here, the sum divided by 10) and then take the remainder. 
So, SM 8 6 4 = (8 + 6 + 4) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8.

Secondly, for the [SM 2 3 4], similarly, it represents the sum (modulo 10) of 2, 3 and 4.
So, SM 2 3 4 = (2 + 3 + 4) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9.

Next, solve [MAX 1 9 6], which represents the maximum out of 1, 9 and 6. So, MAX 1 9 6 = 9.

Lastly, [MIN 1 7 2] represents the minimum out of 1, 7 and 2. So, MIN 1 7 2 = 1. 

So, the expression now stands as:
[SM [MIN 8 7 9] 1 [MAX 7 9 1]].

Next, solve [MIN 8 7 9], which represents the minimum among 8, 7 and 9, which gives us 7.

And the expression now stands as:
[SM 7 1 [MAX 7 9 1]].

Now solve [MAX 7 9 1] which represents the maximum among 7, 9 and 1. It gives us 9.

Now, the expression becomes [SM 7 1 9]. 

Finally, [SM 7 1 9] indicates the sum (modulo 10) of 7, 1 and 9. Therefore, SM 7 1 9= (7 + 1 + 9) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7.

[MAX 8 4 6] = 8 (since 8 is the largest number among 8, 4, 6)
[MIN 2 0 1] = 0 (since 0 is the smallest number among 2, 0, 1)

[MIN 1 9 0] = 0 (since 0 is the smallest number among 1, 9, 0)
[SM 3 8 0] = 11 (since 3 + 8 + 0 = 11)

In the first part of the expression, this is [SM 6 4 4]. SM is an operator that sums all values modulo 10. So, 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 and 14 modulo 10 is 4. So, SM 6 4 4 equals 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the SM operators. 
SM 8 8 6 = 8+8+6 = 22, but as the SM operator takes the sum modulo 10, we have 22 mod 10 = 2.
So, SM 8 8 6 = 2

SM 4 8 5 = 4+8+5 = 17, again using the modulo operation, 17 mod 10 = 7
So, SM 4 8 5 = 7

SM 4 7 9 = 4+7+9 = 20, so 20 mod 10 = 0
So, SM 4 7 9 = 0

So, the expression becomes:
[MIN 6 [SM 2 9 7] [MIN 0 7 [MAX 2 3 2]]]

Calculate the remaining SM operator: 
SM 2 9 7 = 2+9+7 = 18, but with modulo 10 operation, 18 mod 10 = 8
So, SM 2 9 7 = 8

The expression now turns into: 
[MIN 6 8 [MIN 0 7 [MAX 2 3 2]]]

Next, calculate the MAX operator:
MAX 2 3 2 = 3, since 3 is the largest number amongst 2, 3, and 2.

The expression now turns into: 
[MIN 6 8 [MIN 0 7 3]] 

Next, compute the remaining MIN operator:
MIN 0 7 3 = 0, since 0 is the smallest number among 0, 7, and 3

Now, the expression finally turns into: 
[MIN 6 8 0]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Evaluate the nested expressions first: MIN (0, 8, 3) and MAX (5, 7, 8). The minimum of 0, 8, and 3 is 0. And the maximum of 5, 7, and 8 is 8. So the expression becomes: [MIN 4 [SM 2 0 [SM 2 5 8]] [MAX 8 9 [MIN 3 4 3]]].

2. Evaluate the next nested expression: SM (2, 5, 8). The sum of these numbers modulo 10 is (2 + 5 + 8) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5. Now the expression becomes: [MIN 4 [SM 2 0 5] [MAX 8 9 [MIN 3 4 3]]].

3. Now we evaluate the remaining nested expressions: SM (2, 0, 5) and MIN (3, 4, 3). The sum modulo 10 of 2, 0, and 5 is 7, and the minimum of 3, 4, and 3 is 3. So the expression becomes: [MIN 4 7 [MAX 8 9 3]].

4. Evaluate the remaining nested expression: MAX (8, 9, 3). The maximum value of these numbers is 9, so we simplify the expression to: [MIN 4 7 9].

SM 9 7 4 = (9 + 7 + 4) mod 10 = 20%10 = 0

MAX [SM 2 0 3] [SM 5 6 2] 6 = MAX [5 3 6] = 6
MIN 9 5 0 = MIN [9 5 0] = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, find values for each minimum operation: MIN 9 8 5 = 5, MIN 4 3 1 = 1, MIN 7 5 7 = 5.

So the expression then becomes: 

[MAX [SM 5 1 4] 1 [MAX 1 5 [SM 2 4 1]]].

Next, calculate the sum modulo 10 operation for SM 5 1 4 and SM 2 4 1, which means add the numbers together and then take the remainder when divided by 10. So SM 5 1 4 = (5 + 1 + 4) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0, SM 2 4 1 = (2 + 4 + 1) mod 10 = 7 mod 10 = 7.

The expression then is simplified to: 

[MAX 0 1 [MAX 1 5 7]].

Now, find the maximum value in each MAX operation. MAX 0 1 = 1, MAX 1 5 7 = 7.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to calculate what's inside the first bracket, using the SM operator:
[SM 9 6 6] = 9 + 6 + 6 = 21, but since we do the sum modulo 10, the result is 1.
Similarly, [SM 6 7 5] = 6 + 7 + 5 = 18, modulo 10 is 8.
So the first expression simplifies to [MAX [MAX 1 8 5] 4 [MIN [MAX 0 0 2] [MIN 8 5 1] 2]].

Next inside the MAX function, MAX 1 8 5 - here 8 is the highest number.
The expression becomes MAX 8 4 [MIN [MAX 0 0 2] [MIN 8 5 1] 2].

Next, calculating [MAX 0 0 2] and [MIN 8 5 1]:
MAX 0 0 2 = 2 because this is the highest number among them.
MIN 8 5 1 = 1, as this is the smallest number among them.

So the expression now becomes MAX 8 4 [MIN 2 1 2].

MAX 4 9 5 = 9 (because 9 is the largest number among 4, 9, and 5)
MAX 3 9 0 = 9 (because 9 is the largest number among 3, 9, and 0)

Now let's resolve the innermost MIN expression:

Now, resolve the expression within the bracket:

Now substitute this result back into the original expression:

[SM 5 6 7]

Finally, evaluate the last SM expression:
