The expression now is: [SM 3 8 [SM 8 9 6]].

Next, we solve for SM 8 9 6. The sum of 8, 9 and 6 is 23. But we need to take the modulo 10 of that, which gives us 3.

Now the expression is: [SM 3 8 3].

Finally, the sum of 3, 8 and 3 is 14. We take the modulo 10 of that to get 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the inside brackets. [MAX 2 1 7] returns the maximum number between 2, 1, and 7. So, it is 7. Then [MAX 2 1 8] returns the maximum number of 2, 1, and 8. So, it is 8. 

So, the whole expression [MIN [MAX 2 1 7] [MAX 2 1 8] 3] now becomes [MIN 7 8 3], which finally returns the minimum number between 7, 8, and 3. So, the final answer is 3.",3,3

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the innermost operation: [SM 9 9 4]. The ""SM"" operator means taking the sum of the digits modulo 10. So:
SM 9 9 4 = (9 + 9 + 4) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2.

Now, plug this back into the original expression, which now reads:
[SM 2 5 [SM 2 1 2]].
