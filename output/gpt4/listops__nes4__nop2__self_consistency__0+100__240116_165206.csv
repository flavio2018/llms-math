A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the inner operations.

SM 2 0 = (2 + 0) mod 10 = 2 mod 10 = 2

MAX 1 3 = Maximum of 1 and 3 = 3

Next,

MAX 5 6 = Maximum of 5 and 6 = 6

MAX 6 8 = Maximum of 6 and 8 = 8

Therefore, [MIN [MAX [SM 2 0] [MAX 1 3]] [MIN [MAX 5 6] [MAX 6 8]]] becomes MIN 3 6, which is 3.

Next,

MAX 3 0 = Maximum of 3 and 0 = 3

SM 0 8 = (0 + 8) mod 10 = 8 mod 10 = 8

Next,

[MIN 4 0] = 0 (since 0 is the smallest number between 4 and 0)
[MIN 9 2] = 2 (since 2 is the smallest number between 9 and 2)

[SM [MAX 2 1] [MIN 8 5]] = [SM 2 5] = 2 + 5 = 7.

Therefore, we simplified the initial expression to: [MIN [SM 0 6] [SM 8 [MIN [SM 8 0] [MIN 5 8]]]].

Now, we execute the MIN operation between 5 and 8, which gives us 5. So, our expression becomes: [MIN [SM 0 6] [SM 8 [SM 8 0 5]]].

Now, the SM operation with 8, 0 and 5 gives us 3 (8+0+5=13 and 13 modulo 10 equals 3).
So, our expression now becomes: [MIN [SM 0 6] [SM 8 3]].

We execute the SM operation again:
- SM 0 6 equals 6.
- SM 8 3 equals 1 (8+3=11 and 11 modulo 10 equals 1).

So, we simplified our expression to: [MIN 6 1].

Finally, the MIN operation gives us 1, since 1 is the minimum between 6 and 1.

Module operations are defined as the remainder or signed remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another (called the modulus of the operation). Here, all SM operations are modulo 10. It means, whenever the result of the sum is beyond 10, we should eliminate multiples of 10 from the result. That is why SM 8 3, for instance, gave 1 as result (since 11 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 1).

And the minimum of 8 and 4 is 4.
So, MAX [MAX 9 2] [MIN 8 4] = MAX [9] [4] = 9.

Then, MAX [SM [MIN 9 4] [MIN 3 3]] [MAX [MAX 9 2] [MIN 8 4]] = MAX [7] [9] = 9.

- SM [6 3] is 9 (because 6+3=9 which is less than 10)

- MIN [3 1] is 1 (because 1 is the smallest number from the list [3 1])
- MIN [5 4] is 4 (because 4 is the smallest number from the list [5 4])
- MIN [8 8] is 8 (because both numbers in the list [8 8] are 8, so the smallest one is also 8)

Now we plug these back into the equation:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve the innermost expressions:

MIN 2 2 = 2 (since both values are the same, minimum is also the same)
SM 7 4 = 1 (sum of 7 and 4 is 11, but in our case values larger than 10 are reduced modulo 10, so 11 becomes 1)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to simplify each expression within the brackets, starting from the innermost set of brackets.

For the first set, [SM 4 6] gives 4 + 6 = 10, but considering the modulo 10 operator, we have 10 MOD 10 = 0.

So, in the next level brackets, we replace [SM 4 6] with 0.

Thus, we get the following:

[MIN [MAX 0 [MIN 0 0]] [MAX [SM 4 8] [MAX 5 8]]] 
[MIN [MAX 0 0] [MAX [SM 4 8] [MAX 5 8]]] 
[MIN 0 [MAX [SM 4 8] [MAX 5 8]]]

Also, For the expression  [MAX 5 8], the result is 8 as that's the maximum number.

So, we replace [SM 4 8] and [MAX 5 8] in the above expression respectively with 2 and 8:

[MIN 0 [MAX 2 8]]

So the minimum number is 0.

Start by simplifying the innermost brackets, 

[SM 2 3] is 2 + 3 = 5 (MOD 10).

[MIN 5 7] is 5 since 5 is less than 7.

[SM 0 9] is 0 + 9 = 9 (MOD 10).

[MAX 2 0] is 2 since 2 is bigger than 0.

Let's replace the results in the expression:

[MAX [SM 5 5]  [SM 9 2]]

Then:

[MAX [5 + 5 = 10 (MOD 10) = 0] [9 + 2 = 11 (MOD 10) = 1]]

[MAX 1 1] = MAX [1,1] = 1
[SM [MAX 2 0] [MAX 1 1]] = (2+1) mod 10 = 3 mod 10 = 3

- MAX takes two numbers and returns the larger one.
- MIN takes two numbers and returns the smaller one.
- SM adds the two numbers together and then calculates the remainder when divided by 10.

- MIN 3 0 = 0
- SM 1 5 = 6
- MIN 0 6 = 0
- MIN 3 4 = 3
- MAX 6 7 = 7
- MAX 3 7 = 7
- MAX 0 7 = 7 (this is the result of the first part of the expression)

The second part:

- MAX 1 0 = 1
- MIN 4 6 = 4
- MAX 1 4 = 4
- MAX 5 7 = 7
- SM 8 3 = 1 (11 modulo 10 is 1)
