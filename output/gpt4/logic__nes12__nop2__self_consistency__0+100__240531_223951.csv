A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we understand that ""!T"" is False and ""!F"" is True. ""T&T"" is True. ""T"" or anything will also be ""T"". ""F"" and anything will be ""F"". So,
(!T) = F, 
!F = T,
T&T = T,
F| anything = anything, 
anything | T = T, 
anything & F = F, 
anything & T = anything.

Applying these transformations,

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|(!T))|(!(F|T))))|(w&(!T))))&T)|w))&((w&((F|(T&T))|T))|w))&(F|T))

becomes:

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|F)|!(F|T))))|(w&F)))&T)|w))&((w&(F|T)|T))|w))&T)

For which we know that, 

(w|F) = w, 
!(F|T) = F,
(w&F) = F,
(w&(F|T)) = w,
(w|T) = T

Therefore,

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|F)|F)))|F))&T)|w))&((w|T)|w))&T)

becomes:

((w&T)&((w&T)&T&T))

For which we can simplify as:

(w&w)&T

which just simplifies to:

Hence, the simplified logic formula is w&T.",w&T,w

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify ""d|T"" to ""T"" since anything OR True is True.

The expression then becomes: 
(((!F)|F)|((((!((((F&(!(F&T)))&F)&(!((F&(T|(T|F)))|F)))|T))|(!((T|T)|F)))|(!T))|F)).

Now, the following expressions simplify:
- ""F&T"" is ""F"" since False & anything is always False
- ""T|(T|F)"" simplifies to ""T"" since True OR anything is always True

The expression now becomes: 
(((!F)|F)|((((!((((F&(!F))&F)&(!((F&T)|F)))|T))|(!((T|T)|F)))|(!T))|F)).

Then we can simplify further:
- ""!F"" simplifies to ""T"" since NOT False is True
- ""F&(!F)"" simplifies to ""F"" since False & anything is always False
- ""F&T"" simplifies to ""F"" since False & anything is always False

This now becomes: 
((((!((F&F)&F))|T)|(!((T|T)|F)))|(!T))|F)).

The following expressions can also be simplified:
- ""T|T"" is ""T"" since True OR anything is always True
- ""F&F"" is also ""F"" since False & anything is always False

The expression is now: 
((!F|T)|(!T))|F.

We can simplify:
- ""!F"" simplifies to ""T"" since NOT False is True
- ""!T"" simplifies to ""F"" since NOT True is False

The expression is now:

4) According to the law of Identity, u&((z&z)&s|T) simplifies to u&(z&s|T).

5) According to the law of Complement, Any logic and not it equals FALSE. So (t&(T|(T&(m|T))))&t)&F simplifies to F.

6) Finally, anything and FALSE equals to FALSE. So, ((F&(l&F))&((((u&((((z&((!(F|T))|(s|(F|T))))&z)|T)|F))|u)&(!(((t&(T|(T&(m|T))))&t)&F)))&F) simplifies to F.",F,F

    (((F|(T|T)))&((e&((!F|(((w&(w|w))|w)&(T&F)))&(h|T))|(!F)))|T)&(T))

2. Now, we can simplify (T|T) and (w|w) as T and w, respectively:

    ((T)&((e&((!F|((w&w)&F))&(h|T))|(!F)))|T)&(T))

3. The term ((w&w)&F) simplifies to False (because any value ANDed with False is False), so we get:

    ((T)&((e&((!F|F)&(h|T))|(!F)))|T)&(T))
   
4. Not False is True (!F = T), so the formula then becomes:

    ((T)&((e&(T&(h|T))|T))|T)&(T))

5. Any value ANDed with True is the value itself (True & X = X) and any value ORed with True is always True (True | X = True), so:

3) T & anything results in that anything. So T & F results in F.
4) Likewise, !((!(((r&r)&(((l|l)|(t&F))&(f&F)))&F))|T) simplifies to T because it is a disjunction with T.
5) So, the whole that part simplifies to T & T which is always T, and this part now simplifies to b|T which is always T regardless of the value of b.

Let's look at the left side of the formula. 

6) b&T results in b because T & anything (b in this case) results in that thing (b).
7) (b&b)|b simplifies to b|b which is always b. So, the left side of the whole formula simplifies to b.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We begin by simplifying any operation involving True (T) and False (F).

2. Then within the larger expression, ((a&T)&T) simplifies to just a, since 'and' with True doesn't change the original value. Also, ((u&(u&T)) simplifies to u. And (F|F) simplifies to F (since F or F is always F). So, we can rewrite the expression as:

5. (u&F) simplifies to F, and so our final simplified logic expression becomes:

2. (T|T) simplifies to T.
3. (T&(T|T)) simplifies to T&T which is T.
4. (F&T) returns F, because in a logical and operation, if one operand is false, the result is false irrespective of the other operand.
5. (((n&T)|n)|F) simplifies to n|F which is n because F (False) doesn't affect the outcome.
6. That operation is further followed by &F which returns F for the same reasons as point 4.

After these reductions, the initial formula becomes: (((g&F)&T)|T), which simplifies to (F&T)|T, which simplifies to F|T, which finally simplifies to True or T.

3. ""X&F"" equals F.
4. ""X|T"" equals T and ""X&T"" equals X.
5. Finally, ""X&F"" equals F.

((m|((((((e&((e&e)&T))|F)|T)&F)|F)|T))&(((i&(!((F|(m&((((u&u)|(F&T))&(!T))&F)))&T)))&T)&F))

We start by focusing on the most nested parts:

e & (e & e & T) = e, since ""X & X"" equals X.

(u & u) | (F & T) = u, since ""F & T"" equals F (i.e., False and True equals False), ""X | F"" equals X (i.e., X or False equals X)

F|(m&u&!T&F) = F, since ""!T"" equals F (if T is True, !T is False), ""X & F"" equals F, ""F | F"" equals F.

i&!(F)&T = i,  since ""!(F)"" equals T (negation of False is True), ""X&T"" equals X (X being i here)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Simplifications would make the logic formula easier to understand. First, let's consider all parts of the equation where the F (false) value appears. 

1. In logic, False AND anything would give False; and False OR anything would give anything itself.

With these principles in mind, the formula can be simplified as follows:

((d&(T&(T&(T|T)&(!F))))|F)&((d|(F&T)&T)). 

Simplified further:

((d&T&T)&T|F)&((d&F&T)&T). 

Then, let's consider all parts of the equation with T (true) values. 

2. In logic, True AND anything would give anything itself; and True OR anything would give True. 

The formula can be further simplified as follows:

((d|F)&F). 

Finally, let's remember that any term in a logical OR function with False would be False, as False OR anything gives anything itself. Therefore, the final simplified logic formula is: 

d&F.

However, since d AND False always gives a value of False (because 'False and anything' is False), the final simplified logic formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First thing to note in the formula is that F&F or b&F or a&F always simplifies to False because And operation with False results in False. And x|x simplifies to x because anything OR itself will always be itself.

2. Similarly, T|X or X|T, where X can be anything will simplify to True, because anything OR true is always true.

3. We can also note that !T will simplify to False and !F will simplify to True.

4. And we know that x&x simplifies to x because anything And itself will always be itself. 

5. With the rules above we can start by simplifying the inner most brackets.

(((b|b)|b)&F) simplifies to F because of rule 1.
(F&(T|T)) simplifies to F because of rule 1.
!T simplifies to F because of rule 3.

So, part of the formula ((u|(((u|(F&(((b|b)|b)&F)))|(!(T|(T|(F&(T|T))))))|(u|F)))|T) now simplifies to ((u|(u|F))|T) because of rule 2.

Also f|f simplifies to f because of rule 4. 

So, the whole formula now looks like : (f & ((u|(u|F))|T)).

Now, (u|(u|F)) simplifies to u because of rule 4.
And u|T simplifies to T because of rule 2.

 !(k&k)|((T|(F|(T&(j|T))))|T)&((i|(i&(i|i)))|T)|F)  = 
 !(k&k)|T =

As T | ANYTHING is always T and !(k&k) simplifies to !k since any value ANDed with itself remains the same.

3. In the other half of the expression, ((F&(F|(((w|F)|(!T))&F)))&T)&F) simplifies (F&F&T&F), which is F since anything AND False is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, it should be noted that any logic formula, including any other logical variable or literal, when ORed (|) with FALSE or ANDed (&) with TRUE doesn't change the value of the original variable or literal. Moreover, ANDing (&) with FALSE results in FALSE, and ORing (|) with TRUE results in TRUE. ANDing (&) with NOT (or negative) T and ORing (|) with NOT (or negative) of F always gives FALSE. Lastly, NOT (or negative) of F gives TRUE, and NOT (or negative) of T gives FALSE.

1. f | T will just be T because anything ORed with true gives true.
2. T | F becomes T.
3. F & T becomes F.
4. Thus (((T|F)|F)&T)&F eventually simplifies to F.
5. And therefore ((t&(f|(T|F))))&T) simplifies to t & T which is equivalent to t (since anything ANDed with T remains the same).
6. In the expression, r&(i&(F&(F|T))), everything ANDed with F gives F. Therefore the whole expression simplifies to F.
7. d|(T|r) ends simplifying in T, because anything ORed with T gives T. So (!(((d|(T|F))|F)|T)) also simplifies to F (due to NOT).
8. So (d&False) just simplifies to F (anything ANDed with F gives F).
9. F&T simplifies to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's examine the components of the formula: 

1. T&F = F (since for an AND operation to be true both operands must be True, but here one of them is False)
2. F&F = F (again because both operands need to be True for an AND operation to yield True)
3. T|F = T (OR operation will be True if any of the operands are True)
4. F|T = T (following the same reasoning as above)
5. (T&F)&T = F (because T&F yields F as seen above)
6. b|b = b (if both operands of an OR operation are the same, the operation yields that same value)
7. v|T = T (because OR operation yields True if any of the operands are True).

Next, substitute these components into the original formula:

(((F&F)&(!((!(T|((T&F)|T)))))&(T&F))),&(w&F))

Almost all components now are reduced to simple True or False values. Let's procede with further simplifications:

1. F&F = F
2. T|F = T
3. v|T = T

So the formula is now:

(F&(!(!T))&F)&(w&F)

Continue with the simplification:

1. F&!F = F (NOT operation flips the value from True to False and vice versa)
2. w&F = F (AND operation yields False if any of the operands are False).

So the formula is now F&F = F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's take a look at the basic logical operations:

- ""T | anything"" is always true no matter what ""anything"" is (True or False) because ""or"" operation with True is always True.
- ""F & anything"" is always False no matter what ""anything"" is (True or False) because ""and"" operation with False is always False.
- ""!T"" is always False, and ""!F"" is always True.

Consider this part: (((T|F)|((T|T)&(T|F)))&F).
This simplifies as follows:
 1. T|F = T
 2. (T|T) & (T|F) = T & T = T
 3. T & F = F,

so the whole part becomes: (((T|F)|((T|T)&(T|F))) & F = F.

The next part: (F|(T|(T&F))) is simplified as follows:
 1. T|F = T
 2. F|T = T,

so the whole part becomes: (F|(T|(T&F))) = T.

The part (((i&T)&((!(((T|F)|((T|T)&(T|F)))&(F|(T|(T&F)))))|T)|T)) simplifies as follows:
 1. ((i&T)&((!F) | T)) | T = ((i&T)&(T | T)) | T = (i&T | T) = T.

So far, we have (((t|T)|T)|T)= T (the whole formula in the left parenthesis).

The right parenthesis (T&(((F|T)&T)&T)) simplifies as follows:
 1. F|T = T,
 2. T&T = T,
 3. T&T = T.

Therefore, the original logical formula simplifies to T & T = T, which is True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's handle the parenthesis and nested ""or"" and ""and"" operations:

The '&' operation demands for both operands to be true. If one operand is false, the whole expression becomes false. In contrast, The '|' operation demands at least one operand to be true for the whole expression to be true.

Given this, we know that:

1. (F & T) is always = F
2. (F & p & F) is always = F
3. (T | F ) is always = T
4. (!F) is always = T (since ! is the negation operator)

So, (n | (F & T) | F) is equivalent to (n | F | F), which is just n.

With this logic, let's simplify the statement:

((F&((F&(p&F))&T))&(T|(F|(((n|F)|((((n|(((F&T)|F)|(!(F|T))))|(n|(F|F)))&(b|T))&(!F)))&F))).

Substituting the operators' principles, we get:

F & F & T & T & F

We can simplify this further:

F & T - results to F
F & T - results to F
F & F - results to F

So, the final simplified logic formula is

Secondly, no matter the value of any proposition, it along with True with logical or will make the expression become True. Any proposition or False will maintain the original proposition value.

This simplifies to:

v&T&v|F|F

Next, the logical not operation reverses the value of True to False. Also, Anything AND False is False as well as the OR operation with False will maintain the original expression value. So, the equation simplifies to:

- The logical AND between any value and True is equal to that value (X&T = X)
- The logical AND between any value and False is equal to False (X&F = F)
- The logical NOT for False is True (!F = T) and for True is False (!T = F)
- The logical OR between any value and True is always True (X|T = T)

- F or X = X: Because something is either False or the other thing, it will always be the other thing.
- F and X = F: Because something is False and the other thing, it must be False.
- !T = F: The negation of True is False

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, note that False OR False simplifies to False and True OR False simplifies to True. The expression (F|F)|T can be simplified to False OR True which is True. Also, False AND False simplifies to False and True AND False simplifies to False. The expression (l&l)|(T&F) can be simplified to l OR False which is l. 

2. So the expression F&(F&((((l&l)|(T&F))|(l&l))&F) simplifies to False AND xyz which is False.

3. y AND False is false. So, our expression simplifies to (z|(((F|F)|((y&F)|(((((F|F)|T)|F)|T)|(F&(F&((((l&l)|(T&F))|(l&l))&F))))))&T). Which then simplifies to z OR (False AND True) which simplifies to z OR False which is z.

4. (t&T)&F simplifies to xyz&F which is False. The NOT of False is True.

5. Finally, the expression simplifies to z AND True which results in z. 

So, ((z|(((F|F)|((y&F)|(((((F&F)|T)|F)|T)|(F&(F&((((l&l)|(T&F))|(l&l))&F))))))&T))&(!((t&T)&F)) simplifies to z.",z,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, T&F always gives F because logical AND (denoted as &) is only TRUE if both variables involved are TRUE. Secondly, any variable OR-ed (!) with F gives the result of the variable itself. For instance, i|F == i. Similarly, variable OR-ed with T always gives T results.

We also have to consider that !F = T and !T = F, and T | T will always equal T.

So, let's simplify:
((((((i|F)&i)|(((i&(i|((i&i)&i)))|(T&((((!(!T))&(F&(T&F)))&T)|F)))&i))&(z|T))&(F&F))|(T|T))

Replacing, the expression becomes:

After simplifying the internal parts, the formula looks like this:
(b & False) & False).

The output for and operation if any one of the operand is False will always be False. Hence the whole expression simplifies to False. And a negation of True will always be False. Therefore,

2. The expression can now be rewritten as:
(((n&n)&(h|(((o&F) | T) &T | !(F|F&F)))).
Note: n&n = n and n|n = n

3. Furthermore, 'o' and 'F' with 'and' (&) operator would be False (F), and any value 'or' by True (T) would be True (T). So (o&F) becomes F and (F|T) becomes T. And further simplifying, !(F|F&F) = !F = T because 'not' of False is True (!F = T).

4. The expression now simplifies to:
(n&(h| T))

5. Further, 'h' or True (T) simplifies to True (T), because true or any value results to True.

6. The expression now simplifies to: n&T

First, we know that the NOT operator (!) negates the Boolean value of its operand. So, we simplify !F to T, because the negation of False is True.

We also know that anything ORed with False remains the same and anything ANDed with False is False.

Additionally, anything ANDed with True remains the same and anything ORed with True is True.

So, ((F&F)) simplifies to F, (T|(T|T)) simplifies to T, and (F&T) simplifies to F.

Therefore, the given formula is simplified into:

Simplify it further:

1. Inside, T&F simplifies to F, because True & False is False. 
2. !(T&F) is therefore !F, which simplifies to T, because 'not False' is True.
3. !T is F, because 'not True' is False.
4. Any expression with F & anything simplifies to F, which leaves us with n|T.
5. n|T simplifies to T because anything | True is True.
6. Similarly, ((F&(F|T))|T) simplifies to T, because F & anything simplifies to F, anything | True simplifies to True.
7. So the leftmost part of the formula simplifies to (T&n) & T, which further simplifies to T & T, meaning T.
8. The rightmost part of the formula simplifies to (!T) & (d|T) which is F, because 'not True' is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The statement `F & T` is always False, because False AND anything is always False. 

Similarly, `T & F` also equals to False. So, the statement looks like this: 

`!(((((((t|(T&(F|F)))|(F|(T&(!T))))&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)|(F&(T|(!(F|(a|T))))))`.

We can further simplify `(T&F)` and `(T & (!T))`, it is always False because its one operand is always False. Therefore, we have 

`!(((((((t|F)|(F|F))&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)|(F&(T|!(F|T)))`.

`t|F` or `F|F` always equals to `t` or `F`. So, the statement is simplified as

`t & F` simply becomes `F`; then we have

`!((F|F)&F)|(F&(T|!(F | T)))`.

`F | F` equals to `F`. Thus, it's simplified to 

`!((F)&F)|(F&(T|!(F | T)))`.

`F & F` gives us `F`. So, the statement becomes

`!F | (F & (T|!(F or T)))`.

`!F` equals to `T`. Thus it's simplified to

`T | (F & (T | !(F | T)))`.

- `z | T` is always True, regardless of 'z', so we can replace `(z | T)` with `T`.
- `anything & T` is simply `anything`, so we can remove all `& T` parts.
- `r & F` is always False, regardless of the value of 'r'. So, we replace `r & F` with `F`.
- `anything | F` is simply `anything`, so we can remove all `| F` parts.

Step 1:
Let's simplify ""F&(F&F)"" first, which evaluates to F.
The updated expression is: ((F|((((a|(((F)|(!((v&F)&(F|T))))&(n&F))&(k&F)))&(F|(T|T)))&T)|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F)).

Step 2:
Now let's simplify ""v&F"", which evaluates to F. And ""(F|T)"" evaluates to T.
So ""!((v&F)&(F|T))"" simplifies to ""!F"" which in turn simplifies to T.
The updated expression is: ((F|((((a|(T))&(n&F))&(k&F)))&(F|(T|T)))&T)|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F)).

Step 3:
Now let's simplify ""n&F"" and ""k&F"", which evaluate to F.
The updated expression is: ((F|((((a|T)&F)&F))&(F|(T|T)))&T)|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F)).

Step 4:
By rule, ""F & anything = F"", so we can simplify the first part even further.
The updated expression is: ((F&F)&T)|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F)).

Step 5:
This can be further simplified using rule ""F & anything = F"", to:

Step 8:
Applying the rule ""T | anything = T"", ""T&F = F"" we get:

- d&d can be simplified to d.

- ""&"" (conjunction) is the logical and operator. It's True only if both of its arguments are True.
- ""|"" (disjunction) is the logical or operator. It's True if at least one of its arguments is True.
Now let's look at the constants:
- ""F"" stands for False,

(h & h) = h.
((h & T) = h, because anything and True is just the thing.
q |  ((h & F)) = q, because anything and False will be False, and anything or False is the thing.

3. This leads to `(x&((y&T)|T))|((o&F)|F))&T` which simplifies to `(x&((y&T)|T))|F`.

4. `(y&T)|T` simplifies to `T` because `y&T` will be either `T` or `F` and `T | T/F` will always be `T`.

5. NOT operation would only change the Boolean value of its immediate operand to its complement - Hence, in !(T|T), the inner T|T simplifies to T and then the NOT operation changes it to F
6. Similarly, for the expression !(T&(T&F)), the combination of T&F simplifies to F first. Then T&F simplifies to T&F which again simplifies to F due to AND operation. Applying NOT operation on F results in T.

- Logical NOT (!) of True (T) gives False (F), i.e., !T = F.

    - Anything or with T gives T.
   
3. Logical And (&) can be simplified as follows:
    - Anything and with F gives F.
    - Anything and with T gives the value as it is.

 
Applying these rules to the given expression, and taking it step by step:

((!F)|(((((i&((((e|((e&e)&e))&(!(F|(F|F))))&(!F))|T))|F)&i)&T)&(F|(!(T&(((t&t)|F)|T)))))) becomes:

1. =((T)|(((((i&((((e|((e&e)&e))&!(F)|F))&T))|F)&i)&T)&(F|!T))) (Applying !F=T and !(T&(((t&t)|F)|T))=!T).

2. =((T)|(((((i&(((((e&e)&e)&T))&T))|F)&i)&T)&F)) (Applying !(F)|F = !F and !(T) = F).

3. =(T|((((i&(e&T))|F)&i)&T)) (Applying (e&e) = e, e|F = e and F&T = F).

4. =(T|(((i&e)|F)&i)) (Applying e|F = e and T&F = F).

5. =(T|((i&e)&i)) (Applying T&i = i).

6. =(T|(i&(e&i))) (Applying the associative law ((p&q)&r = p&(q&r))).

Now, because anything OR (|) with true (T) is always true, we can simplify it to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Negation (!) operators start first:

    (i) !T is always F
    (ii) !F is always T

So your expression becomes:

2. Now we can apply AND operations second:

    (i) T&F and F&T both are always F
    (ii) T&T is always T
    (iii) F&F is always F
    (iv) F&(Any expression) will always be F

After applying these rules, your expression becomes:

(!T is always F)

- T&F is F.
- T|T is T.
- (!F)|F is T.
- !T is F.

So let's substitute these values in the expression:

((F|(l|((((F&(!T))|(T&((v&(F&T))|T)))|T)|T)))&(b&(T&F))).

After this, immediately we can notice that there are still several obvious simplifications we can do:

- F&(!T) can be converted to F.
- F&T, also, can be converted to F. 

After that we get:

((F|(l|((F|T)|T)))&(b&F)).

Then substitute F | T with T:

Conversely, 'F&anything' (False and anything) always equals False. '!(T)' (not True) is always False while '!(F)' (not False) is always True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (T | F) simplifies to T. This makes (!F) irrelevant, so that simplifies to T as well. The statement becomes: 

    ((s&(T|(((F&((g&T)&g))|(g&(g&(g|g))))&F))&T)&(((s|((T&(!T)&F))&F)&s)&T))

2.  F & statement is always F, so ((F&((g&T)&g))&(F&((g&g)&g))) becomes F, which simplifies everything in the parentheses to :

    ((s&T)&(s&T))
   
3.  (T & statement) becomes statement. So, above statement can become:

     (s & s)
     
4. (statement & statement) or (statement | statement) simplifies to statement. So above can be simplified to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. !F would evaluate to T as we're taking logical not of False.
2. F|T, F|Anything, T|F, T|Anything always result in T, says that the result is True regardless of the value of the other literal.
3. F&T, F&Anything, T&F, Anything&F always result in F, says that the result is False regardless of the value of the other literal.
4. k&F results F regardless of the value of k.
5. e|(!T) which can be written as e|F. It results False, if e is False; otherwise, it results True if e is True.

So, the given formula can be simplified to:
(T&(T|T)) | (F&F)

From step 2 and 3, we know that 
T|T results in T, F & F results in F.

So, the formula further simplifies to

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the simplification of innermost expression:
- F&T gives False.
- F&F and T&T gives both False & True respectively.
- F|T and F|F gives True & False respectively.
- So, second (!(!(s|(((F|T)|(F|F))|(T&T))))) gives s.

Then, second step, the simplification of other inner expressions:
- !(F&(F|T)) logically gives True.
- F&(True & s) gives False.
- So, result for the first expression T & False is False.

Then, the simplification of the other inner expressions:
- (t&t)&F gives False.
- !(F|False) gives True.

So, the entire original expression ((False&F)|T)|True boils down to 'True'. 
Hence, the expression is greatly simplified to T or True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any variable OR-ed with ""F"" simplifies to the variable itself, and any variable AND-ed with ""F"" simplifies to ""F"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We can start simplifying from the inside. Any literal value ""and"" False (A & F) always results in False. Hence, (T & F) is F, (F & T) is also F and (F & F) is also F. Therefore, ((F & (T & (F & T))) & F) simplifies to F.
2. One must apply the negate twice, for instance: !!A is equal to A. Hence, !!F turns into F and !!(!(!F)) simplifies to T.
3. (T | F) is T and it remains T when negated. Therefore, the expression, (T | F) simplifies to T and (! (T | F)) simplifies to F.
4. For the ""or"" operator: A | F is always equal to A. Consequently, we have F | F reduced to F. 
5. Applying the ""and"" operator: A & T is always equal to A. Thus, in the formula: x & F simplified to F.

In summary, the whole expression simplifies to ((x & F) & T) which further simplifies to just False (F) because anything ANDed with False is always False.",F,F

(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, note that:
- ""f&F"" always equals to False ('f' AND False)
- ""!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T)"" is same as ""!T"" which is False (NOT True)
- ""(F|T)&T"" is just True (False OR True) AND True
- ""F|F"" is always False (False OR False)
- ""F|T"" is always True (False OR True)

Next, we simplify parts where these values appear:
- ""(w|(f&F))"" simplifies to ""w"" (w OR False). 
- ""u|((F|T)&T)"" simplifies to ""u|T"" which is always True (u OR True).
- ""T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))"" simplifies to ""T&T&T"" which equals to True.
- ""w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))"" simplifies to ""w&(F|T)"" which is equal to w (w AND True).
- ""!(F|F)"" is just True (NOT False).
- So ""(w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))"" simplifies to ""w|(w|w)"" which equals to ""w"" (w OR w OR w).
- ""((!(F|F))|F)"" simplifies to ""T|F"" which is always True (True OR False).

Finally, substitute these values back in:

The entire expression ""(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T))"" simplifies to ""(w&T)|T"" which simplifies to ""T|T"" and finally equals to ""T"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The first step is to handle the T (True) and F (False) values. Any statement OR T will always be True, because at least one of the values will always be True. Conversely, any statement AND F will also always be False, because at least one of the values will always be False. Implementing these rules yields:

   a|T  -->  T
   F|(F|(F|(T&T)))  -->  F|(F|(F|T))  -->  F|F|T  -->  T
   o&(o&o&T)  -->  o&(o&o)

   f&F  -->  F
   e|(T|F)  -->  e|T  -->  T
   v|T  -->  T

2. After the first step, the formula can be rewritten as:
