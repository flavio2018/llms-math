A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's calculate the value of the nested MIN and MAX operations.

MAX 1 [MIN 2 2 7 3] 9 = MAX 1 2 9 = 9, MAX 1 [MIN 2 8 5 1] 7 = MAX 1 1 7 = 7

SM 2 3 1 0 = (2+3+1+0) MOD 10 = 6 MOD 10 = 6

SM 6 3 8 9 = (6+3+8+9) MOD 10 = 26 MOD 10 = 6,

Now that we have found the results of each MAX and MIN operation within the SM ones, we substitute back into the equation:

[MIN 1 [SM [SM 5 2 0 7] 5 [MIN 4 9 1 9] 0] 6 [MIN [SM 3 5 0 [SM 8 4 2 4]] 5 5 0]].

Next we compute the SM operators, which contribute the sum of the enclosed numbers modulo 10:

- [SM 5 2 0 7] = (5+2+0+7) mod 10 = 4.
- [SM 8 4 2 4] = (8+4+2+4) mod 10 = 8.

Substituting back into the equation:

[MIN 1 [SM 4 5 [MIN 4 9 1 9] 0] 6 [MIN [SM 3 5 0 8] 5 5 0]].

Continue with the remaining SM operations:

- [SM 4 5 [MIN 4 9 1 9] 0] = (4+5+(Min of 4,9,1,9)+0) mod 10 = (4+5+1+0) mod 10 = 0. 
- [SM 3 5 0 8] = (3+5+0+8) mod 10 = 6.

Substituting back into the equation:

[MIN 1 0 6 [MIN 6 5 5 0]].

Now, we compute remaining MIN operations:

- [MIN 6 5 5 0] = Min of (6, 5, 5, 0) = 0.

Substituting back into the equation:

[MIN 1 0 6 0].

Finally, we calculate the remaining MIN, which represents the minimum value of the list [1, 0, 6, 0]. The minimum number is 0.

Becomes:

Then, let's perform the remaining SM operations:

As decimal integers are treated as modulo 10 in this notation, 15 becomes 5 and 7 becomes 7::

= [SM 5 [MAX 5 7 7 5 3]]

Next, evaluate the MAX operation:

= [SM 5 7]

The sum modulo 10 of 5 and 7 is 2 (since (5 + 7) mod 10 results in 2), so we get:

[MIN 2 3 [MAX 9 5 1 8] [SM 4 3 0 5]] is equal to MIN (2 3 9 12), because MAX (9 5 1 8) = 9 and SM (4 3 0 5) = 4 since the sum of their elements 12 is bigger than 10 (we take only the ones place of the sum). The minimum in the resulting list (2 3 9 12) is 2.

[SM 6 7 7 4] = 4, because the sum is 24 (we take only the ones place of the sum).

[MIN 3 5 0 3] = 0, because 0 is the smallest of all elements in the list.

Now, [MAX 1 3 0 7] = 7, since it's the highest number in the list. 

[MIN 0 5 8 6] = 0.

[MIN 6 8 2 6] = 2.

[MIN 4 0 2 3] = 0.

Then, [MIN 4 5 [MAX 1 3 0 7] [MIN 0 5 8 6]] is equal to MIN (4 5 7 0) = 0.

Finally, [SM [MIN 6 8 2 6] [MIN 4 0 2 3] 2 8] = SM (2 0 2 8) = 2.

SM [MAX 2 8 [MIN 4 8 0 0] 9] 3 [MIN 8 3 0 2 5].

For the next step we will compute minimum of [4,8,0,0] which EQUALS TO 0.

We have:

[SM 1 6 4 6] - is 17 but taking modulo 10 it will be 7

[SM 3 4 5 4] - is 16 but taking modulo 10 it will be 6
[MAX 9] - because max of 9, 1, 3, and 2 is 9

Step 2: Continue the computation with the new values. We still need to compute:

- SM 0 4 9 5 = 18 mod 10 = 8
- SM 9 0 8 7 = 24 mod 10 = 4
- MAX 0 7 9 9 = 9
- MAX 3 6 2 6 = 6

Simplify these first, from inside the brackets to outside:

- SM 7 [SM 0 4 9 5] [MAX 4 5 8 4] 6 = SM 7 8 8 6 = 29 mod 10 = 9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should calculate the values within the innermost brackets. 

The minimum (MIN) between 7, 0, 3, and 6 is 0. 
The minimum between 0, 0, 9, and 5 is 0. 
The sum (SM) of 9, 6, 9, and 3 gives 27, but since we take a modulo 10, the result is 7. 
The minimum between 3, 6, 2, and 6 is 2. 
The minimum between 8, 2, 3, and 1 is 1. 
The sum of 5, 6, 2, and 3 is 16, but we take it modulo 10 to get 6. 
The minimum between 9, 2, 0, and 0 is 0.

From [MIN 0 0 7 0] the minimum value is 0. 
From [MIN 3 8 7 2] the minimum value is 2. 
From [SM 5 7 1 6] the sum is 19 but we take it modulo 10 to get 9. 
From [MIN 5 4 0 6] the minimum value is 0.

Substituting again into the original expression, we get:

MAX [SM 0 4 2 5] 8 [SM 9 5 0 1] 0.

Going another level deeper: 

From [SM 0 4 2 5] the sum is 11, which modulo 10 is 1. 
From [SM 9 5 0 1] the sum is 15, which modulo 10 is 5.

[MIN 0 [MAX 1 7 9 4] translates to: the minimum number between 0 and the maximum between 1 7 9 4. Taking the maximum of 1 7 9 4 results in 9. So the expression simplifies to [MIN 0 9], which gives 0.

[SM 8 1 5 3] translates to: the sum of 8 1 5 3 modulo 10. The sum of these digits is 17, and 17 modulo 10 results in 7.

So the first MAX operation simplifies to [MAX 0 7 4]. Taking the maximum of these numbers results in 7.

The next internal operation is [SM 2 6 2 5] which translates as the sum of 2 6 2 5 modulo 10. The sum of these digits is 15, and 15 modulo 10 results in 5.

[SM 1 5 3 9] translates to the sum of 1 5 3 9 modulo 10. The sum of these digits is 18, and 18 modulo 10 results in 8.

So [MIN 9 7 5 8] simplifies to MIN of these numbers, resulting in 5.

[SM 4 4 1 6] and [SM 2 4 1 0] translate to the sum of 4 4 1 6 and 2 4 1 0 modulo 10. Calculating these operations, we get 15 and 7, respectively. So our expression then becomes  [MIN 7 [MAX 8 5 7] 1] [MAX [MIN 5 5 9 1] [MIN 2 6 2 6] 0 8] 3].

MAX of 8, 5, and 7 is 8. So [MIN 7 8 1] simplifies to 1.

MIN 6 5 4 2 = 2
SM 8 5 4 5 = 22, but we need to add up digits till we aren't left with a single-digit number. It can be achieved by adding the digits of 22. Therefore, SM 8 5 4 5 = 4.
MIN 4 5 0 2 = 0
MAX 1 6 3 9 = 9
MIN 1 7 3 6 = 1
MIN 0 3 1 4 = 0
MAX 1 3 2 1 = 3

SM 1 4 0 2 = 7
SM 1 4 4 6 = 15, and then by adding the digits of 15, SM 1 4 4 6 = 6

For 
[MAX 9 7 4 0] = 9
[MAX 4 1 1 3] = 4
[SM 8 2 9 1] = (8+2+9+1)%10 = 20%10 = 0

[SM 0 5 2 0] = (0+5+2+0)%10 = 7%10 = 7
[MAX 4 9 1 5] = 9
[MIN 3 0 9 9] = 0
[SM 5 0 7 8] = (5+0+7+8)%10 = 20%10 = 0

Plugging these results into the original equation, we get:
[SM [MIN 0 [MIN 9 4 6 4] [SM 0 2 2 8] 2] 0 [MIN 4 [MIN 2 7 7 [MAX 9]] [MIN 0 1 7 0] 7] 6].

In the next step, we have 4 operations to solve: [MIN 9 4 6 4], [SM 0 2 2 8], [MIN 2 7 7 [MAX 9]] and [MIN 0 1 7 0]. 

For 
[MIN 9 4 6 4] = 4
[SM 0 2 2 8] = (0+2+2+8)%10 = 12%10 = 2
[MIN 2 7 7 [MAX 9]] = 2 (since [MAX 9] = 9)
[MIN 0 1 7 0] = 0

Substitute these results back into the expression, we receive:
[SM 4 2 0 [MIN 4 [MIN 2] [MIN 0 7] 7] 6].

The next step is to solve [MIN 2], [MIN 0 7] and then [MIN 4 [MIN 2] [MIN 0 7] 7].

For

[MIN 0 7] = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we must find out what the innermost commands are and solve them. These are [MAX 1 0 0 5], [MIN 8 4 4 0], [SM 3 4 9 0], [SM 9 4 2 5], [MAX 1 8 5 5], [MIN 6 3 7 4], [MAX 1 8 1 5], and [MAX 8 6 4 5]. 

Starting with [MAX 1 0 0 5], the maximum single-digit integer is 5.

[MIN 8 4 4 0] has the minimum integer of 0.

[SM 3 4 9 0] sums to 16 which then becomes 6 after modulo 10 operations. 

[SM 9 4 2 5] can be calculated as 20, and with modular 10 operation, it becomes 0.

[MIN 6 3 7 4] gives 3 as the smallest integer.

[MAX 1 8 1 5] has 8 as the maximum integer.

[MAX 8 6 4 5] also has 8 as the maximum integer.

Now, we can replace these commands in the original expressions:

[MIN 2 5 [MAX 9 [MIN 5 5 8 0] 8 [MIN 3 6 0 4]] [MAX [MAX 0 4 8 3] 0 [MIN 8 8 9 8] 1]].

Notice that we have [MIN 5 5 8 0] and [MIN 8 8 9 8] inside.  We can simplify this to [MIN 0] and [MIN 8], respectively. 

The list becomes:

[MIN 2 5 [MAX 9 0 8 0] [MAX 8 0 8 1]]

Now, find [MAX 9 0 8 0] and [MAX 8 0 8 1], which equals 9 and 8, respectively.

Let's work on the remaining MAX expressions first:
[MAX 9 8 9 3] = 9
[MAX 8 [SM 5 8 4 6] = 8 if we calculate the SM expression first: [SM 5 8 4 6] = (5+8+4+6) % 10 = 23 % 10 = 3.  However, as 8 (from MAX) is still greater, we fall back to 8.
[MIN 8 8 5 8] = 5
[MIN 6 4 1 5] = 1

Putting these back into the expression, we get: 

[MIN 4 [SM 3 9 6 1] 7 [MAX [MAX 8 3 3 [SM 2 7 6 0]] 2 [SM 5 4 7 1] 5]]

[SM 2 7 6 0] = (2 + 7 + 6 + 0) % 10 = 15 % 10 = 5
[SM 5 4 7 1] = (5 + 4 + 7 + 1) % 10 = 17 % 10 = 7

MIN 6 0 [SM 6 [SM 4 6 1] [MIN 1 [MAX 8] [MAX 9] 0]

Now, the next step results in:

- SM 4 6 1 -> 11 mod 10 -> 1
- MAX 8 -> 8
- MAX 9 -> 9

So, our expression becomes: 

MIN 6 0 [SM 6 1] [MIN 1 8 9 0]

Keep going to the next step:

- SM 6 1 -> 7

So we get:

MIN 6 0 7 [MIN 1 8 9 0]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression inside the innermost brackets is always evaluated first.
Start with [SM 2 2 6 4], which is equal to 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4.
Next is [MAX 9 0 4 9] which is equal to max(9, 0, 4, 9) = 9.
Again next is [MAX 4 [MIN 9 0 5 0] 5 [MIN 4 6 0 2]], which is equals to max(4, min(9, 0, 5, 0), 5, min(4, 6, 0, 2)) = max(4, 0, 5, 0) = 5.
Then next operation is [MAX 1 [MIN 2 9 6 8] 8 [MAX 5 0 8 5]], equals to max(1, min(2, 9, 6, 8), 8, max(5, 0, 8, 5)) = max(1, 2, 8, 8) = 8.
So the transformed expression now becomes:
[SM 4 [SM 3 [MAX 4 8 8 9] [MAX [MAX 2 8 6 3] [SM 6 3 8 7] 9 8] 3] [MAX 5 8 0 4] 1].
Continue working through the above expression.
[SM 3 [MAX 4 8 8 9] [MAX [MAX 2 8 6 3] [SM 6 3 8 7] 9 8] 3] becomes [SM 3 9 [MAX [MAX 2 8 6 3] [SM 6 3 8 7] 9 8] 3], because MAX 4 8 8 9 equals to max(4, 8, 8, 9) = 9.
[SM 3 9 [MAX [MAX 2 8 6 3] [SM 6 3 8 7] 9 8] 3] then becomes [SM 3 9 [MAX 8 [SM 6 3 8 7] 9 8] 3], because MAX 2 8 6 3 equals to max(2, 8, 6, 3) = 8.
[SM 3 9 [MAX 8 [SM 6 3 8 7] 9 8] 3] then becomes [SM 3 9 [MAX 8 4 9 8] 3], because SM 6 3 8 7 equals to 6 + 3 + 8 + 7 mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4.
[SM 3 9 [MAX 8 4 9 8] 3] then becomes [SM 3 9 9 3], because MAX 8 4 9 8 equals to max(8, 4, 9, 8) = 9.
So the transformed expression until now is [SM 4 [SM 3 9 9 3] [MAX 5 8 0 4] 1].
[SM 3 9 9 3] equals to 3 + 9 + 9 + 3 mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4.
Transformed expression becomes [SM 4 4 [MAX 5 8 0 4] 1]
[MAX 5 8 0 4] equals to max(5, 8, 0, 4) = 8. Transformed expression becomes [SM 4 4 8 1]
[SM 4 4 8 1] equals to 4 + 4 + 8 + 1 mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7.

[SM 4 0 7 5] = (4+0+7+5) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6

Substitute these in the original expression:

[MAX 1 4 9 0] = 9
[MAX 3 2 1 3] = 3

[MAX [SM 7 3 9 8] [MAX 8 6 0 2] 0 2] = [MAX 27 8 0 2] = [MAX 7 8 0 2] = 8

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to break down the equations into simpler forms.

Starting with the inner SM operators:
[SM 5 6 1 3] = (5+6+1+3)%10 = 5
[SM 9 5 6 9] = (9+5+6+9)%10 = 9
[SM 6 6 1 3] = (6+6+1+3)%10 = 6
[SM 3 0 4 1] = (3+0+4+1)%10 = 8
[SM 1 6 8] = (1+6+8)%10 = 5

Next, we can handle the MAX:
[MAX 7 6 4 8] = 8
[MAX 0 6 9 0] = 9
[MAX 6 3 5 1] = 6
[MAX 2 0 5 4] = 5

Substituting the above results back in, we get:

[MIN [SM [MIN 3 1 5 8] [SM 9 1 5]] 5 6] [MIN 4 1 [MIN [SM 6 8] 2] [MAX 6 5 6]] 2 8].

We can further simplify the SM operation:
[SM [MIN 3 1 5 8] 9] = ([MIN 3 1 5 8] + 9)%10
[SM 6 8] = (6+8)%10 = 4

So the equation becomes:
[MIN [SM 1 9] [SM 1 5] 5 6] [MIN 4 1 [MIN 4 2] [MAX 6 5 6] 2] 8.

Handling the remaining MAX and MIN:
[MIN 4 2] = 2
[MAX 6 5 6] = 6

So we now have:
[MIN [SM 1 9] [SM 1 5] 5] [MIN 4 1 [MIN 2] [MAX 6] 2] 8.

Finally, solving for the remaining SM operations:
[SM 1 9] = [SM 1 5] = [SM 5 6] = ([SM 2] + [MAX 6] + 2)%10 = 0

1. [MAX 6 0 0 5] gives MAX value which is 6. 
2. [MIN 7 6 3 6] gives MIN value which is 3.
3. So, we replace these values and expression becomes [SM 6 3 5 2].
4. Applying SM (sum modulo 10), [SM 6 3 5 2] = (6 + 3 + 5 + 2) mod 10 = 6.
5. Similar steps for [MIN 9 9 8 4] gives 4, [MAX 4 8 7 9] gives 9. 
6. So, expression becomes [SM 9 4 9 3] which becomes 5 after applying SM.
7. Now, we have our max operand list as [MAX 6 6 5 8] which gives MAX value 8.
8. On the similar lines, [MIN 9 6 1 4] gives 1, [MAX 6 8 3 9] gives 9.
9. So, expression [MIN 1 9 3 8] gives MIN value 1.
10. Again, [SM 4 5 2 7] gives 8, [SM 1 9 9 9] gives 8.
11. Thus, [MIN 8 8 7] also gives 7.
12. Now, we have the final MAX operand list [MAX 3 1 7], which yields 7.

[MIN 5 3 7 5] = 3
[MIN 2 3 6 3] = 2

Now insert these calculated numbers into the original expression and simplify the next level:

[MAX 7 0 2 6] equals to maximum of {7,0,2,6} which is 7.

- [MIN 0 2 6 4] = 0
- [SM 5 6 7 0] = 8 (since 5 + 6 + 7 + 0 = 18, and 18 modulo 10 = 8)

- MAX [0 2 6 7] = 7
- MIN [4 2 8 6] = 2

A: Let's think step-by-step.","We proceed as follows:

Start with finding the sum of the numbers using the SM operator. Remember SM produces the sum modulo 10.

[SM 9 5 2 9] =  (9 + 5 + 2 + 9)mod10 = 25mod10 = 5

[SM 8 7 3 6] = (8 + 7 + 3 + 6)mod10 = 24mod10 = 4

[SM 8 8 0 2] = (8 + 8 + 0 + 2)mod10 = 18mod10 = 8

[SM 1 0 2 5] = (1 + 0 + 2 + 5)mod10 = 8mod10 = 8

This simplifies the original expression to: 

[MAX 0 [MAX [MAX 5 4 7 8] [MAX [MAX 7 1 1 6] 8 2 1] 2 7] 6 [MAX 0 [MAX 8 4 [MAX 4 5 2 5] 1] 8 [MAX [MAX 3 0 9 2] 3 7 [MIN 0 0 7 2]]]

Now find the maximum using MAX operator:

[MAX 5 4 7 8] = 8
[MAX 7 1 1 6] = 7
[MAX 4 5 2 5] = 5
[MAX 3 0 9 2] = 9
[MIN 0 0 7 2] = 0

This simplifies the expression to:

Continue using the MAX operator:

[MAX 8 2 7] = 8
[MAX 8 4 5 1] = 8
[MAX 9 3 7 0] = 9

Finally, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, there are various nested expressions that involve the MAX and MIN operators. Let's calculate these expressions first:

[MIN 3 5 [SM 8 [MAX 7 3 4 0] 9 [MAX 0 2 9 1]] [MAX [MIN 1 9 7 1] 9 4 [MAX 2 9 5 3]]] 

[SM 8 [MAX 7 3 4 0] 9 [MAX 0 2 9 1]] in this expression, the MAX operator is applied on the lists [7 3 4 0] and [0 2 9 1], the results are then substituted in the SM expression:

SM 8 7 9 9 = 33 % 10 = 3.

Therefore, our rewritten first half of the original query is [MIN 3 5 3 [MAX [MIN 1 9 7 1] 9 4 [MAX 2 9 5 3]]].

The next set of nested expressions are [MIN 1 9 7 1] and [MAX 2 9 5 3]:

MIN 1 9 7 1 = 1.

MAX 2 9 5 3 = 9.

Therefore, our rewritten first half of the original query again becomes [MIN 3 5 3 [MAX 1 9 4 9]]. Applying the MAX operation, we obtain [MIN 3 5 3 9].

And the least value in the list [3 5 3 9] is 3. 

The second half of the original query is:

[MAX 0 [MIN [MAX 1 3 3 9] 0 7 [MIN 1 8 3 3]] 5 [MAX [SM 5 3 5 7] [SM 3 1 0 9] 3 8]]

Firstly, there are multiple nested queries again involving MAX, MIN, and SM operations. Let's find each of these results:

[MAX 1 3 3 9] = 9.

[MIN 1 8 3 3] = 1.

Substitute these two results back into the second part of the original query:

(MAX 0 [MIN 9 0 7 1] 5 [MAX [SM 5 3 5 7] [SM 3 1 0 9] 3 8])

The MIN operator over the list [9 0 7 1] gives us 0. Substituting this back into the query we get:

(MAX 0 0 5 [MAX [SM 5 3 5 7] [SM 3 1 0 9] 3 8])

Let's first calculate the two SUM queries:

[SM 5 3 5 7] = 20 % 10 = 0.

[SM 3 1 0 9] = 13 % 10 = 3.

After substituting these values back in, we have:

(MAX 0 0 5 [MAX 0 3 3 8]) which simplifies further to (MAX 0 0 5 8).

The MAX of the list [0 0 5 8] is 8.

For [SM 2 2 8 7] we sum the numbers and take the sum modulo 10: 2 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 19, 19%10 = 9

For [SM 7 9 4 4] we sum the numbers and take the sum modulo 10: 7 + 9 + 4 + 4 = 24, 24%10 = 4

For [MAX 8 9 0 7] we take the max value: 9

For [SM 4 0 8 8] we sum the numbers and take the sum modulo 10: 4 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 20, 20%10 = 0

For [MAX 2 4 0 8] we take the max value: 8

For [MIN 2 6 7 7] we take the min value: 2

For [MAX 5 9 2 5] we take the max value: 9

Next, we calculate [MIN 8 7 9 0], getting: 0. We also calculate [MAX 4 2 9 0], getting: 9. 

We substitute this back into the expression, getting [MIN [MIN 0 9 5] 7 [MIN [MIN 0 3 8 3] 3 4 [MIN 9 2 9 9] 9]] 

Next, we calculate [MIN 0 9 5], [MIN 0 3 8 3], [MIN 9 2 9 9], getting: 0, 0, 2. 

Substituting, we get [MIN 0 7 [MIN 0 3 4 2 9]]

Finally, we calculate [MIN 0 7], [MIN 0 3 4 2 9], getting: 0, 0.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's compute all the MAX and MIN operations:

MAX [MIN 2 9 0 4] -> MAX 2 (since MIN operation will give us the smallest number from the list)
MAX 0 3 1 8 -> MAX 8 (since MAX operation will give us the largest number from the list)
MIN 0 4 [MAX 7 3 0 9] -> MIN 0 [MAX 9] -> MIN 0 (since MIN operation will give us the smallest number from the list)

Continue computing MIN and MAX operations:
MIN 2 7 8 0 -> MIN 0 
MAX 9 -> MAX 9
MIN 5 [MAX 9] 8 0 -> MIN 5 9 8 0 -> MIN 0 

The expression is now:
[MAX 0 [MIN 0 [SM 7 1 8 8]] 7 5] 6 0 5

Next, solve the SM operation:
SM 7 1 8 8 -> (7+1+8+8) modulo 10 -> 24 modulo 10 -> 4

The expression is now:
[MAX 0 4 7 5] 6 0 5 -> MAX 7 (since MAX operation will give us the largest number from the list)

The expression is now:

[MAX [MIN 4 7 0 6] [MAX 0 5 8 6] 6 4] simplifies to
[MAX 0 8 6 4] which reduces to 8.

[SM 5 [MIN 8 9 5 0] [SM 6 7 4 6] 8] simplifies to 
[SM 5 0 23 8] which simplifies to [SM 5 0 3 8] because 23 mod 10 is 3, so this simplifies to 16 but taking that modulo 10 we get 6.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First calculate the values inside the most nested brackets:

- MAX 6 4 0 8 = 8
- MIN 1 4 1 5 = 1
- SM 2 6 6 8 = 22, but since SM is sum modulo 10, we take the remainder when 22 is divided by 10, which is 2.
- MIN 5 3 8 1 = 1
- SM 0 3 6 4 = 13, but SM is sum modulo 10, so the result will be 3.
- MAX 2 0 7 3 = 7
- MIN 2 6 5 3 = 2

Replacing these values in our expression we get:

- MAX 9 8 1 9 = 9
- MIN 1 2 1 = 1
- MIN 3 0 8 5 = 0

Replacing these values again:

MAX 6 (MAX 0 8 9 1) 4 (SM (MIN 3 8 8 0) 1 (SM 4 7 2 2) 9)

Next, calculate the SM operation:

Replace this value in the equation:

- SM [2 8 7 6] is the modulo 10 sum of 2, 8, 7, 6, which is (2+8+7+6)%10 = 3. 

- SM [3 4 (MIN 2 9 2 8) 3] becomes SM [3 4 2 3] as the minimum between 2, 9, 2, 8 is 2. Then this is (3+4+2+3)%10 = 2.

- MAX [1 (SM 9 2 4 4) 2 (MAX 4 4 3 5)] turns into MAX [1 9 2 5] as the sum modulo 10 of 9 2 4 4 is 9 and the maximum amongst 4 4 3 5 is 5. So, this becomes 5.
