A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first simplification we can make is for the inner part of the expression, (F|T). In a logical OR operation, if either value is true, the result is true. Thus:

(F|T) simplifies to T.

Substitute this back into the general expression:

Next, let's look at (F&F). In a logical AND operation, both values must be true for the result to be true. Thus:

(F&F) simplifies to F.

Substitute this back into the general expression:

((o&T)&(!F))

Now, NOT F (¬F or !F) is equivalent to T. Thus:

(!F) simplifies to T.

Substitute this back into the general expression:

((o&T)&T)

Now let's look at (o&T). In a logical AND operation, if either value is false, the result is false. However, we don't know the value of o. Thus, we cannot further simplify this expression.

And lastly, let's look at ((o&T)&T). Again, in a logical AND operation, if either value is false, the result is false. However, since we don't know the value of o, we cannot further simplify this. Since we know the value of T, which is true, the overall expression simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, (F&F) equates to False because for an AND operation to be True, both literals need to be True.

So we'll first replace (F&F) with F. Now we have this:

Now, the NOT operator (!) negates the value of what's inside the parentheses. So since F is inside the parentheses and it equates to False, the negation of False is True.

We now have this:

(T&((o&o)&F))

The operation (o&o) equates to o itself because the same literal ANDed with itself will give the same literal.

Now we have:

(T&(o&F))

Finally, since the o literal (which can be either True or False) is being ANDed with False (F), the result is always going to be False no matter the value of o.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

(((s&s)|s)&(s&(T|T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Since T|T is always true, the formula can be simplified as: ((s&s)|s)&(s&T)

2) In logic, a variable 'and' with itself is itself, so 's & s' can also be simplified as 's'. So, the expression becomes: (s|s)&(s&T)

3) Similarly, a variable 'or' with itself is itself, so 's | s' can be simplified to 's'. So, the simplified expression now becomes: s&(s&T)

4) If an expression states s & true, it will always be s, as anything logical 'and' with true remains itself. So, the expression simplifies to: s&s

5) Again referring to the second point, 's & s' is also 's', so the fully simplified logic formula is simply 's'.",s,s

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the terms under the ""and"" symbol (&), since in logical operations ""and"" applies to two fundamentals, if any of them is false, then the whole expression is false.

(n&n) will be just n, because anything ""and"" itself is just itself. This applies the same to (s&s), resulting to s.

Next, you apply the ""and"" operation to (s&F), this yields to F, because for a statement to be true under ""and"" condition both should be true. In this case F (false) makes it false.

Lastly, you apply the ""or"" operation to (n|F), this yields to n, since under ""or"" condition, only one of the expression needs to be true. In this case F (false) makes it to be n (can be true or false).

So, the simplified expression is: n.",n,n

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, consider the logic : (F|T). As either one or both can be true, this logic will evaluate to True (T).

Secondly, (!F) will evaluate to true because not false is true. So, (!F|T) = (T|T) = T.

Thirdly, (T&F) will evaluate to false  because for an 'and' operation to be true both conditions need to be true, but here F is False.

Lastly, consider the entire formula: (((!F)|(F|T))&(T&F)) = ((T|T)&F) = (T&F) = F.

So, the simplified result of the whole logic formula is False (F).",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's evaluate the True and False values:

The operation (!T) means NOT True, which gives us False.

The operation (T&T) means True AND True, which gives us True.

The operation (T&F) means True AND False, which gives us False.

So, we substitute these values back into our original formula and get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula simplifies as follows:

1. Simplify the True AND True as it is always True: ((c|F)|(c|F)&T)). 
2. The element c OR False is just c itself, as anything OR False = that same thing: Hence, the formula simplifies to: (c|c&T))).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","For any Boolean variable y, (y|y) is identical to y.

So, the given formula can be simplified as:

(y & (y | (y&T)))

Next, we simplify (y | (y&T)), according to absorption laws in boolean algebra which states that A + AB is equal to A, so above expression simplifies to:

(y & y)

((i&(T&T))&((i&T)&i)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, handle the simplest parts. ""T & T"" is True, as in logical and operation, if both operands are True, the result is True. Substituting back into the formula we get:

((i & T) & ((i & T) & i))

""T & i"" is i, because ""T & anything"" keeps the value of ""anything"". Now, the formula becomes:

(i & (i & i))

""i & i"" is obviously ""i"", as something anded with itself remains the same. So, now we have:

(i & i)

Again, ""i & i"" is simply ""i"". So the final simplified formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that any value logically ANDed with itself is the same value (c&c = c). 
Second, anything logically ORed with True is True, regardless of the initial value (x|T = T). 
Also, any value logically ANDed with True is the initial value (x&T = x), and any value logically ANDed with False is False (x&F = F). 

Thus applying these rules: 

First, perform the logical operation (c&c) which gives us c.
((c&c)|T) becomes (c|T). 

Second, as discussed above (c|T) gives us T

Third, since any value logically ANDed with False is False, (T&F) results in F. 

Finally, (T&F) & l becomes F & l which results in F. 

So (((c&c)|T)&(l&(T&F))) simplifies ultimately to False (F).",F,F

Third, we know that o|T stands for 'o or True', which is always equal to True (T) because o is eiter true or false and 'or' operation with true results in true. So, the formula becomes ((T&T)&T).
