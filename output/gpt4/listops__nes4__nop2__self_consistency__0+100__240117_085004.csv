A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we'll need to solve the expressions within the most inner brackets:

[MIN 9 7] equals 7 because 7 is smaller than 9.
[MAX 8 4] equals 8 because 8 is larger than 4.
Therefore, [MAX 7 8] equals 8.

Similarly, we solve: 
[SM 6 5] equals 1 because (6 + 5) modulo 10 equals 1.
[MAX 8 9] equals 9 because 9 is larger than 8.
Therefore, [SM 1 9] equals 0, due to the modulo operation.

Substituting our answers into the first-half expression, we have [SM 8 0], which equals 8.

The second half of the expression is solved similarly:
[MIN 0 7] equals 0.
[SM 6 4] equals 0 because (6 + 4) modulo 10 equals 0.
Therefore, [SM 0 0] equals 0.

Also, [MAX 6 4] equals 6.
[MIN 8 5] equals 5.
Thus, [MAX 6 5] equals 6.

Substituting the results into the second part gives us [SM 0 6], which equals 6.

SM 6 3 = 9 (6+3=9)

SM [7] [9] = 6 (7+9=16, but as we're doing sum modulo 10, so the answer becomes 16−10=6)

SM 9 9 = 8 (9+9=18, but as we're doing sum modulo 10, so the answer becomes 18−10=8)

MIN 8 8 = 8 (Both values are the same)

MAX [8] [8] = 8 (Both values are the same)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's decode the inner part of every operation.

We have to find [MAX 9 1] which is 9, as 9 is larger than 1.
The result of [MIN 6 2] is 2, as 2 is smaller than 6.
Now, we can replace these in the expression.

After that, we find [SM 6 9] and [SM 2 8]. Sum of 6 and 9 is 15, but as it's modulo 10, it gives 5. Sum of 2 and 8 is 10, modulo 10 again gives 0. Now replacing these as well.
 
Then we find [SM 6 1] which is 7, [SM 7 1] which is 8, [SM 2 6] which is 8 and [SM 3 7] which is 0. Then replacing these back into the equation.

We replace these values back in the expression to get: 

[SM [MAX 9 0] [MAX 7 0]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we have to solve the expressions within the brackets.

MIN 1 7 = 1

SM 9 2 = 1 (since 9 + 2 = 11 and 11 modulo 10 = 1)

Therefore, MAX [MIN 1 7] [SM 9 2] = MAX 1 1 = 1

Next,

SM 6 6 = 2 (since 6 + 6 = 12 and 12 modulo 10 = 2)

MAX 9 0 = 9

Therefore, MAX [SM 6 6] [MAX 9 0] = MAX 2 9 = 9

Now we have SM [MAX [MIN 1 7] [SM 9 2]] [MAX [SM 6 6] [MAX 9 0]] which can be reduced to SM 1 9. 

SM 1 9 = 0 (since 1 + 9 = 10 and 10 modulo 10 = 0)

Next, for the second half of the expression,

MAX 1 0 = 1

MAX 6 9 = 9

Therefore, MAX [MAX 1 0] [MAX 6 9] = MAX 1 9 = 9

Next,

MAX 1 8 = 8

MAX 5 0 = 5

Therefore, SM [MAX 1 8] [MAX 5 0] = SM 8 5 = 3 (since 8 + 5 = 13 and 13 modulo 10 = 3)

Now we have SM [MAX [MAX 1 0] [MAX 6 9]] [SM [MAX 1 8] [MAX 5 0]] which can be replaced by SM 9 3.

SM 9 3 = 2 (since 9 + 3 = 12 and 12 modulo 10 = 2)

This leaves us with SM [SM [MAX [MIN 1 7] [SM 9 2]] [MAX [SM 6 6] [MAX 9 0]]] [SM [MAX [MAX 1 0] [MAX 6 9]] [SM [MAX 1 8] [MAX 5 0]]].

MAX 3 0 = the maximum of 3 and 0, which is 3
SM 7 8 = 7+8 = 15, but this is a sum modulo 10 operation, so the outcome is actually 15 modulo 10 = 5
The expression becomes:

MIN 6 3 = the minimum of 6 and 3, which is 3

MIN 7 5 = the minimum of 7 and 5, which is 5

Breaking down the innermost operations first:

    MAX 3 2 = 3;

    SM 2 0 = 2;

    MAX 6 0 = 6;

    SM 0 6 = 6;

    MIN 4 7 = 4;

    SM 7 7 = 4 (as sum modulo 10 of 7 and 7 is 4);

    MAX 9 6 = 9;

    SM 8 8 = 6 (as sum modulo 10 of 8 and 8 is 6).

Now, with the replaced values, the expression looks like:

    MAX [SM [MIN 3 2] [MAX 6 6]] [SM [MIN 4 4] [MAX 9 6]].

Solving further:

    MIN 3 2 = 2;

    MAX 6 6 = 6;

    MIN 4 4 = 4;

    MAX 9 6 = 9.

Replacing the computed values, we now have:

    MAX [SM 2 6] [SM 4 9].

Solving the sum modulo 10:

    SM 2 6 = 8;

    SM 4 9 = 3 (as sum modulo 10 of 4 and 9 is 3).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the expressions in the innermost brackets/spaces:

Step 1: MAX 9 6 is 9. SM 0 5 is 5. Thus, MAX [MAX 9 6] [SM 0 5] becomes MAX 9 5, which is 9.

Step 2: SM 0 4 is 4. SM 1 3 is 4. Thus, SM [SM 0 4] [SM 1 3] becomes SM 4 4, which is 8 (because 4 + 4 is 8).

Step 3: SM 1 8 is 9 (because 1 + 8 is 9 but solving the postfix notation modulo 10 gives us the same number). MAX 2 0 is 2. Thus, SM [SM 1 8] [MAX 2 0] becomes SM 9 2, which is 1 (because 9 + 2 is 11 and 11 modulo 10 is 1).

Step 4: SM 1 1 is 2. MAX 1 3 is 3. Thus, MAX [SM 1 1] [MAX 1 3] becomes MAX 2 3, which is 3.

Now, we can solve the expressions with MIN and MAX operators:

Step 5: SM 9 8 is 7 (because 9 + 8 is 17 and 17 modulo 10 is 7). We have MIN [SM [MAX [MAX 9 6] [SM 0 5]] [SM [SM 0 4] [SM 1 3]]] calculated as 7.

Step 6: MAX [SM [SM 1 8] [MAX 2 0]] [MAX [SM 1 1] [MAX 1 3]] is calculated as 3 (maximum of 1 and 3).

Substitute these new values back into the simplified equation to further simplify it:
[MIN [SM i 2] [SM j 3 1]]

[MIN [SM 6 2] [SM 1 3 1]]

Now solve the last brackets:
k) [SM 6 2] = 8 (6 + 2 is 8, no need for modulo 10 in this case)
l) [SM 1 3 1] = 5 (1 + 3 + 1 is 5, no need for modulo 10 in this case)

Substitute these values back into the main equation to get our final simplified equation:
[MIN k l] = [MIN 8 5]

Since the minimum of 8 and 5 is 5, the final solved value is 5.",5,3

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[MAX [MIN [MIN [MIN 3 0] [SM 1 5]] [MAX [MIN 3 4] [MAX 6 7]]] [MIN [MAX [MAX 1 0] [MIN 4 6]] [MAX [MAX 5 7] [SM 8 3]]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the inner brackets:
MIN 3 0 = 0
SM 1 5 = 6
MIN 3 4 = 3
MAX 6 7 = 7
MAX 1 0 = 1
MIN 4 6 = 4
MAX 5 7 = 7
SM 8 3 = 1 (because we are taking sum modulo 10)

Substitute the values into the expression:

[MAX [MIN [MIN 0 6] [MAX 3 7]] [MIN [MAX 1 4] [MAX 7 1]]]

Next, calculate the inner operations:

MIN 0 6 = 0
MAX 3 7 = 7
MAX 1 4 = 4
MAX 7 1 = 7

Substitute these values back into expression:

[MAX [MIN 0 7] [MIN 4 7]]

Finally, calculate the last operations:

MIN 0 7 = 0
MIN 4 7 = 4

Substitute these values back into the expression:

[MAX 0 4]

So, the final result is MAX 0 4 = 4.",4,4
