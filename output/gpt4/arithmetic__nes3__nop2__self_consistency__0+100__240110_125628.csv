10-64 = -54, which mod -100 = -54.

Then substitute the value back into the overall equation:

(60+5 - (-54*44)). 

Next, calculate the product:

So, (28-58)-(-50*-98)= -30-0= -30 which is a negative number. So, we compute its modulo -100.
-30 mod -100= -30.

Similarly, we compute the result of the operations in the innermost bracket in ""((-47-76)+(-66-36))"":

-47-76=-123. This is a negative number, so we compute modulo -100.
-123 mod -100= -23

-66-36=-102 which is a negative number. So, we compute its modulo -100.

Then we must compute 1--43. Since this operation result is positive, we must find its modulo 100. 1--43 equals 44, which subtracting by a multiple of 100 (0 in this case), produces 44.

So, our intermediate expression is (16 - 44).

On the other side, we should compute 87*5. The product is a positive value, so we must find the modulo 100 of this result. 87*5 equals 435, and when subtracted by 400 (which is a multiple of 100), it produces 35.

Next we compute 88*-52. In this case, since the result is negative, we should compute its modulo -100. 88*-52 equals -4576, and when added to 4600 (which is a multiple of 100), it produces 24.

So, the second part of the expression is (35 - 24).

Let's go back to the first part, which was (16 - 44). This operation results in a negative value (-28), so we must find its modulo -100, which is 72 (adding 100 to -28).

Then we multiply 72 * (35 - 24), which equals 72 * 11 = 792. As this result is positive, we must find its modulo 100, which is 92 (792 - 700, which is a multiple of 100). Thus, the answer is 92.",92,-8

99,arithmetic,self_consistency,(((-71+-67)*(-72+-84))-((-4--63)*(-13+-19))),"Q: Solve the following arithmetic expression computing the modulo 100 of each intermediate value if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative:
(((-71+-67)*(-72+-84))-((-4--63)*(-13+-19))).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, always perform inside the parentheses:

-71 + -67 = -138 but since it's negative, we calculate it ""modulo -100"" which is equal to -38.

-72 + -84 = -156, since it's negative, we take it modulo -100 and get -56.

-4 + -63 = -67, but since it's negative, we take it modulo -100 which gives us -67.

-13 + -19 = -32, since it's negative, we take it modulo -100 which gives us -32.

Then we perform the multiplication:

-38 * -56 = 2128, since it's positive we take it modulo 100 and obtain 28.

-67 * -32 = 2144, since it's positive we take it modulo 100 and obtain 44.

Lastly, we subtract the results:

28 - 44 = -16. Since this is negative, we compute it modulo -100 which is equal to -16. 

So, (((-71+-67)*(-72+-84))-((-4--63)*(-13+-19))) equals to -16.",-16,16
