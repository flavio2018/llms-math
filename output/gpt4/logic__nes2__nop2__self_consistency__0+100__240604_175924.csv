A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that 'e' and 'F (False)' through a logical 'and' operation, results in False. This is because for 'and' (&) operation to produce True, both inputs need to be True.

Next, we have 'd or d', which essentially means if either of them is True it will result in True. Since they are same, it will simplify to 'd'. 

So, the original formula ((d|d)|(e&F)) simplifies to (d|F). 

Finally, 'd or F (False)' will simply result in 'd'. This is because 'or' operation produces True if any one of the inputs is True. Here we have 'd' or False. Hence, if 'd' is True it remains True, if 'd' is False it remains False.
