A: Let's think step-by-step.","For the provided expression, we start from the innermost brackets and then move further. 

Step 1: 

Analyzing [MAX 7 9 3 7] gives us 9 since that's the maximum of the numbers. 
Doing the same with [MAX 8 2 1 4] gives us 8.
[MIN 0 5 3 7] --> 0, the minimum value. 

Step 2: 

We replace these inside brackets in the main expression and then, again, solve the new inner brackets:

For brackets: [MAX 1 9 8 3] --> 9
And [SM 2 1 8 1] irrespectively of their order gives 2+1+8+1 = 12, and applying SM gives 12 modulo 10  --> 2
And: [MAX 7 4 9 5] --> 9
And: [MAX 8 1 5 5] --> 8
And: [MAX 1 0 7 9] --> 9
And: [SM 1 1 7 6] gives 1+1+7+6 = 15; 15 modulo 10 --> 5

Step 3:

Put them back, yielding:

[SM 7 [SM 9 7 [MIN 2 2 0 2] 4] [SM 2 [MAX 9 9 8 6] 1 [MIN 0 7 9 5]] 7].

Then, [MIN 2 2 0 2] --> 0 and [MAX 9 9 8 6] --> 9.

Step 4: 

Substitute these values back into the brackets: 

[SM 7 [SM 9 7 0 4] [SM 2 9 1 [MIN 0 7 9 5]] 7].

Then, [SM 9 7 0 4] and [MIN 0 7 9 5] give 9+7+0+4 = 20; 20 modulo 10 --> 0 and 0, respectively.

Step 5:

Substitute again inside their brackets:

[SM 7 0 [SM 2 9 1 0] 7].

Calculate [SM 2 9 1 0] --> (2+9+1+0)modulo 10 --> 2

Step 6: 

Insert it back:

[MAX 7 3 5 6] -> 7 
[MIN 6 8 5 7] -> 5
[MIN 2 5 5 1] -> 1

[SM 3 [MIN 9 1 5 9] [MAX [SM [SM 2 5 7 4] 6 3 0] [MIN 6 5 4 1] 7 4] 3].

And then get the result of the MIN operation [MIN 9 1 5 9] -> 1.

So, the expression becomes:

And then get the result of the MIN operation [MIN 6 5 4 1] -> 1.

So, the expression becomes:

[SM 3 1 [MAX [SM [SM 2 5 7 4] 6 3 0] 1 7 4] 3].

Now take the SM operation [SM 2 5 7 4] -> (2 + 5 + 7 + 4) % 10 = 18 % 10 = 8.

So, the expression becomes:

[SM 3 1 [MAX [SM 8 6 3 0] 1 7 4] 3].

Now take the SM operation [SM 8 6 3 0] -> (8 + 6 + 3) % 10 = 17 % 10 = 7.  

So, the expression becomes:

[SM 3 1 [MAX 7 1 7 4] 3].

Now take the MAX operation [MAX 7 1 7 4] -> 7.

- MIN 8 4 7 5: The minimum is 4.
- MIN 9 8 1: The minimum is 1.
- MAX 6 9 3 6: The maximum is 9.


Substitute these results into the expression:

Next, we calculate the next layer of minimum:

- MIN 1 5 9: The minimum value is 1.

Our expression becomes:

[SM 6 [MAX 4 1] 7 [MIN 1 9 [SM 4 6 1 5] 0]]

Next, we calculate the remaining maximum and minimum:

- MIN 1 9: The minimum value is 1.

Our expression becomes:

Now calculate the sum:

- SM 4 6 1 5: The sum is 16 and the modulo 10 of 16 is 6.

Substitute these results into the expression:

Then calculate the last minimum:

- MIN 1 6 0: The minimum value is 0.

After substituting this value into the expression, we get:

For MIN:
[Min 6 1 0 7] = 0

[SM 1 [MAX [SM 7 8 1 8] 3 [SM 3 7 7 3] 9] = SM 1 [MAX 4 3 0 9] = SM 1 9 = 0 (because 1 + 9 = 10 and 10 modulo 10 = 0)

[MIN [SM 1 6 1 9] 8 2 [MAX 7 5 1 8]] = MIN 7 8 2 8 = 2

Now, substitute these values back into the initial expression:
[SM [MAX 6 1 8] 0 2]

This equals:

Replacing these equations with their answers:

Solving the new innermost brackets:

[SM 5 4 2 9] = 0 (in modulo 10)
[MAX 2 7 9 0] = 9

- MAX 2 [MAX 0 9 5 4] 5 calculates to MAX 2 9 5 with 9 being the highest number.

- [SM 2 1 5 3] = (2+1+5+3) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1

- MIN 2 4 8 4 results in 2
- MIN 5 5 1 6 results in 1
- MIN 2 7 8 0 results in 0

Next, we evaluate the SUM operation (Remember that the SM operation gives results as a sum modulo 10):

- SM 4 1 1 9 results in 5 (15 mod 10)
- SM 5 7 3 2 results in 7 (17 mod 10)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, let's start by processing the innermost lists one by one:

[SM 4 8 0 4] returns 6 because sum of the numbers (4+8+0+4=16) modulo 10 gives 6,
[MAX 1 6 2 7] returns 7 because 7 is the maximum number in this list,
[SM 6 6 9 0] returns 1 because sum (6+6+9=21) modulo 10 gives 1.

The expression now becomes:

[SM 3 3 9 0] -> 5
[MIN 5 5 7 7] -> 5
[SM 2 9 3 5] -> 9

- MIN 7 4 9 8 = 4

[MIN 7 0 3 6] is 0, [MIN 0 0 9 5] is 0, [SM 9 6 9 3] is 7 (since sum is 27 and 27 modulo 10 is 7), [MIN 3 6 2 6] is 2, [MIN 8 2 3 1] is 1, [SM 5 6 2 3] is 6 (since sum is 16 and 16 modulo 10 is 6), [MIN 9 2 0 0] is 0, [MIN 8 6 6 6] is 6.

With these results, our expression simplifies to [MAX [SM [MIN 0 0 7 0] 4 [MIN 3 8 7 2] 5] 8 [SM [SM 5 7 1 6] 5 [MIN 0 5 4 6] 1] 0].

In the second step we calculate the remaining MIN operations: [MIN 0 0 7 0] is 0, [MIN 3 8 7 2] is 2, [MIN 0 5 4 6] is 0.

Our expression then becomes [MAX [SM 0 4 2 5] 8 [SM [SM 5 7 1 6] 5 0 1] 0].

In the third step, we solve the remaining SM operations: [SM 0 4 2 5] is 1 (since sum is 11 and 11 modulo 10 is 1), [SM 5 7 1 6] is 9 (since sum is 19 and 19 modulo 10 is 9).

Our expression simplifies to [MAX 1 8 [SM 9 5 0 1] 0].

In the next step we solve the remaining SM operation: [SM 9 5 0 1] is 5 (since sum is 15 and 15 modulo 10 is 5).

Our expression then becomes [MAX 1 8 5 0].

[MIN 2 [MAX 9 9 7 9] [SM 6 4 2 1] 0]
For MIN, we choose the smallest number. [MAX 9 9 7 9] is 9, [SM 6 4 2 1] is (6+4+2+1) mod 10 = 3. So, [MIN 2 9 3 0] = 0.

[SM 7 [MIN 2 9 7 0] 1 [MIN 0 8 3 1]] 
Replace [MIN 2 9 7 0] with 0 (as calculated above), and [MIN 0 8 3 1] is 0. So, it is [SM 7 0 1 0] or (7+0+1+0) mod 10 = 8.

Next, calculate
[MAX 2 0 6 8], which is 8 (Because it's the maximum)

Moving on to the next set of innermost bracket expressions:
[SM 7 [MIN 5 4 9 2] 1 [MAX 1 1 3 7]].

[MIN 4 3 8 6] is 3.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, take the operations nested deepest and evaluate them. That includes the several MIN and SM operations. 

Remember that:
MIN is the operation that finds the smallest of given values.
SM is the operation that adds the values together, and then if the sum is greater than or equal to 10, it removes a multiple of 10 to make it a single digit value.

So let's go:

- [MIN 5 6 9 4] = 4
- [MIN 2 9 2 0] = 0
- [MAX 6 3 5 4] = 6
- [SM 1 1 1 8] = 1 (as 1 + 1 + 1 + 8 =11 and we use modulo 10 for SM operation)
- [MIN 3 1 9 1] = 1
- [SM 5 4 3 5] = 7 (as 5 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 17 and we use modulo 10 for SM operation)
- [SM 6 9 4 6] = 5 (as 6 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 25 and we use modulo 10 for SM operation)
- [SM 4 8 4 4] = 0 (as 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 20 and we use modulo 10 for SM operation)

Replace these in our original question and continue:

- [SM [MAX 8 [MAX 4 0 8 0] 9 [MIN 5 6 1 6]] [MAX [MAX 5 7 0 6] 3 8 [SM 8 1 7 0]] 7 9]

Then, continue from deepest operations:

- [MAX 4 0 8 0] = 8
- [MIN 5 6 1 6] = 1
- [MAX 5 7 0 6] = 7
- [SM 8 1 7 0] = 6

You get:

- [SM [MAX 8 8 9 1] [MAX 7 3 8 6] 7 9]

Next, solve the two MAX operations:

- [MAX 8 8 9 1] = 9
- [MAX 7 3 8 6] = 8

We get:

- [SM 9 8 7 9]

And finally you can calculate the SM operation:

- [MIN 0 9 7 4] = 0

- [SM 1 5 3 9] = (1+5+3+9) mod 10 = 8
- [MIN 9 7 5 8] = 5
- [SM 4 4 1 6] = (4+4+1+6) mod 10 = 5
- [SM 2 4 1 0] = (2+4+1+0) mod 10 = 7

- [MIN 2 6 2 6] = 2
- [MAX 1 2 0 8] = 8
- [MIN 7 8 8 3] = 3

Now, replacing these sub-expressions with their calculated values in the original expression, we get:
[SM 0 5 [MAX 0 0 5] 5 [MIN 3 3]]

Continuing with the next round of calculations:
- [MAX 0 0 5] = 5
- [MIN 3 3] = 3

Substituting these results:
[SM 0 5 5 5 3]

- [MIN 2 5 6 7] = 2 (since the minimum value is 2)
- [MAX 6 8 8 6] = 8 (since the maximum value is 8)
- [MIN 7 9 4 7] = 4 (since the minimum value is 4)

- [MAX 8 9 5 3] = 9 (since the maximum value is 9)
- [MAX 9 8 4 6] = 9 (since the maximum value is 9)
- [MIN 7 ... 0] = 0 (since the minimum value is 0)

Substituting all these expressions in, the initial expression reduces to:

[SM [SM [MAX 6 2 1 1] [MIN 4 2 8 8] 0 3] 7 8 [MAX [MAX 4 1 7 1] 5 0 1]]

Next, we can solve the four functions left in the brackets:

- [MAX 6 2 1 1] = 6 (since the maximum value is 6)
- [MIN 4 2 8 8] = 2 (since the minimum value is 2)
- [MAX 4 1 7 1] = 7 (since the maximum value is 7)
- [MAX 5 0 1] = 5 (since the maximum value is 5)

Substituting these in, the expression becomes:

The last max function remaining is [MAX 7 5 1] = 7. Plugging this in, we get:

MIN 8 2 0 5 = 0,
MAX 2 9 3 6 = 9,
MIN 0 3 0 2 = 0,
SM 6 2 1 9 = (6+2+1+9) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8,
MAX 7 7 8 1 = 8,
MAX 2 3 4 9 = 9,
SM 1 3 9 3 = (1+3+9+3) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6.

The expression then will be simplified to [MAX [MIN [MAX 8 9 6 0] 7 3 [MAX 3 9 0 0]] 7 5 [MAX 4 [MIN 8 7 1] [MAX 0 9 6 3] 2]].

Now, in order to continue, it's needed to simplify the parts in brackets starting from the innermost again:
MAX 8 9 6 0 = 9,
MAX 3 9 0 0 = 9,
MIN 8 7 1 = 1,
MAX 0 9 6 3 = 9.

The expression then will be simplified to [MAX [MIN 9 7 3 9] 7 5 [MAX 4 1 9 2]].

Let's carry on with the simplification:
MIN 9 7 3 9 = 3,
MAX 4 1 9 2 = 9.

The expression then will be simplified to [MAX 3 7 5 9].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, calculate the values inside the deepest brackets.
- [MIN 6 5 4 2] is 2, 
- [SM 8 5 4 5] is 2 (because sum of 8+5+4+5=22 and we take 2 modulo 10),
- [MIN 4 5 0 2] is 0,
- [MAX 1 6 3 9] is 9,
- [MIN 1 7 3 6] is 1,
- [MIN 0 3 1 4] is 0,
- [MAX 1 3 2 1] is 3,
- [SM 1 4 4 6] is 5 (sum of 1+4+4+6=15 and we take 5 modulo 10).

So, the list becomes:
[MAX [MAX [MAX 9 2 2] 4 [SM 0 9 2 3] 9] 2 [SM [SM 1 4 0 2] 3 0 [SM 3 2 9 5]] 0].

Next, calculate remaining sums and maximums.
- Further simplification shows [MAX 9 2 2] is 9,
- [SM 0 9 2 3] is 4 (0+9+2+3=14, 14 modulo 10 = 4),
- [SM 1 4 0 2] is 7 (1+4+0+2=7),
- [SM 3 2 9 5] is 9 (3+2+9+5=19, 19 modulo 10 = 9).

The simplified list is:
[MAX [MAX 9 4 9] 2 [SM 7 3 0 9] 0].

Then, find the remaining maximums and sums.
- [MAX 9 4 9] is 9,
- [SM 7 3 0 9] is 9 (7+3+0+9=19, 19 modulo 10 = 9).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the innermost nested expressions:

[MIN 2 1 1 3] = 1, because 2, 1, 1, and 3 the smallest number is 1.

[MAX 2 3 5 9] = 9, because among 2, 3, 5, and 9 the largest number is 9.

[MIN 8 8 0 2] = 0, because among 8, 8, 0 and 2 the smallest number is 0.

[MIN 4 2 4 1] = 1, because among 4, 2, 4, and 1 the smallest number is 1.

[SM 0 8 7 5] = (0+8+7+5) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0, because the sum modulo 10 of 0, 8, 7 and 5 is 0.

[SM 0 0 7 5] = (0+0+7+5) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2, because the sum modulo 10 of 0, 0, 7 and 5 is 2.

[MIN 3 0 8 5] = 0, because among 3, 0, 8, and 5 the smallest number is 0.

[MAX 1 5 2 7] = 7, because among 1, 5, 2, and 7 the largest number is 7.

Now, we substitute those results into the original expression:

[MIN [MIN 6 [SM 1 0 1 8] 3 [SM 4 9 0 4]] 9 [SM 1 0 [SM 0 7 0 3] [SM 2 1 3 7]]] 7].

Again, we simplify the innermost nested expressions:

[SM 1 0 1 8] = (1+0+1+8) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0, so the result is 0.

[SM 4 9 0 4] = (4+9+0+4) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7, so the result is 7.

[SM 0 7 0 3] = (0+7+0+3) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0, the result is 0.

[SM 2 1 3 7] = (2+1+3+7) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3, the result is 3.

Substitute these results back to the original expression:

[MIN [MIN 6 0 3 7] 9 [SM 1 0 0 3]] 7].

Continue to simplify:

[MIN 6 0 3 7] = 0, as 0 is the smallest number.

[SM 1 0 0 3] = (1+0+0+3) mod 10 = 4 mod 10 = 4, so the result is 4.

So now our expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, compute all the MIN, MAX and SM operations inside the brackets first (this follows the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule).

For the innermost MIN operations we have:
* [MIN [MAX 9 7 4 0] [MAX 4 1 1 3] 6 4] = min(9,4,6,4) = 4
* [MIN 2 [SM 0 5 2 0] 7 [MAX 4 9 1 5]] = min(2,(0+5+2+0)%10,7,9) = min(2,7,7,9) = 2

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should check the inner expressions:

[MAX 7 1 9 2] gives us 9 (maximum of 7, 1, 9, 2). 

[MAX 7 8 0 5] gives us 8 (maximum of 7, 8, 0, 5).

[SM 1 0 2 8] calculates sum modulo 10 of 1, 0, 2, 8 and gives us 1 (sum of 1, 0, 2, 8 is 11, which results 1 when taken modulo 10).

[MAX 9 8 8 0] gives us 9 (maximum of 9, 8, 8, 0).

Finally, [MIN 8 8 5 8] and [MIN 6 4 1 5] give us 5 and 1, respectively (minimum of 8, 8, 5, 8 is 5 and minimum of 6, 4, 1, 5 is 1).

Then, we replace these values in our main expression and solve again:

Now our expression becomes:

[MIN 4 [SM 3 [MAX 9 8 9 3] 6 [MAX 9 6 6 1]] 7 [MAX [MAX 8 [SM 5 8 4 6] 3 [SM 2 7 6 0]] 2 [SM 5 4 7 1] 5]]

Again, let's get the values of inner expressions:

[MAX 9 8 9 3] gives us 9.

[SM 5 8 4 6] calculates sum modulo 10 of 5, 8, 4, 6 and gives us 3.

[SM 2 7 6 0] calculates sum modulo 10 of 2, 7, 6, 0 and gives us 5.

And, [SM 5 4 7 1] calculates sum modulo 10 of 5, 4, 7, 1 and gives us 7.

After replacing these values, our expression becomes:

[MIN 4 [SM 3 9 6 [MAX 9 6 6 1]] 7 [MAX [MAX 8 3 3 5] 2 7 5]]

Again, solving inner expressions:

[SM 3 9 6 [MAX 9 6 6 1]] gives us 4. (Sum modulo 10 of 3, 9, 6 and the max, which is 9 is 4)

[MAX 8 3 3 5] gives us 8. 

Finally, the expression becomes:

[MIN 4 4 7 [MAX 8 2 7 5]]

Now, just solve them normally:

[MAX 8 2 7 5] gives us 8.

MIN 9 3 0 6 = 0
MAX 6 7 5 8 = 8
SM 4 0 8 = (4 + 0 + 8)modulo 10 = 2
So, SM 4 [MIN 9 3 0 6] 8 [MAX 6 7 5 8] = 2

SM 1 7 0 2 = (1 + 7 + 0 + 2)modulo 10 = 0
MAX 9 9 7 0 = 9
MIN 0 0 1 9 = 0
So, MIN 0 [SM 1 7 0 2] 1 [MAX 9 9 7 0] = 0

MIN 5 8 3 0 = 0
MAX 1 8 5 5 = 8
SM 4 0 8 = (4 + 0 + 8)modulo 10 = 2

Now, simplify this:

MAX 0 0 5 2 = 5

Putting the value back into the main expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's evaluate the MIN and MAX operations, noting that the sum modulo 10 operation simply takes the sum of the numbers and gives the remainder after division by 10.

The inner most MIN and MAX operators are [MIN 6 7 0 6] which equals 0, [MAX 2 0 1 6] which equals 6, [MAX 6 0 2 7] which equals 7, [MAX 7 0 6 5] which equals 7, [MAX 8 2 4 3] which equals 8, and [MAX 6 3 9 5] which equals 9.

Next, let's evaluate the SM operations. Again, SM operation is the sum modulo 10, so [SM 0 7 3 6] is (0+7+3+6) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6, [SM 9 7 7 1] is (9+7+7+1) mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4, [SM 6 6 2 3] is (6+6+2+3) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7, and [SM 5 6 0 6] is (5+6+0+6) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7. 

Then the expression further simplifies to:

[MIN 6 0 [SM 6 4 6 1] [MIN 1 [MAX 8 0 3 7] [MAX 9 7 9 1] 0]]

The remaining SM operation [SM 6 4 6 1] is (6+4+6+1) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7, so the expression further simplifies to:

[MIN 6 0 7 [MIN 1 [MAX 8 0 3 7] [MAX 9 7 9 1] 0]]

Next, we evaluate the remaining MAX operations which are [MAX 8 0 3 7] equals 8 and [MAX 9 7 9 1] equals 9.

Now the expression reads as:

[MIN 6 0 7 [MIN 1 8 9 0]]

Then, the remaining MIN operations, [MIN 6 0 7] equals 0 and [MIN 1 8 9 0] equals 0.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's resolve the expressions inside the inner-most brackets. 

- The first expression inside the inner-most brackets is SM 2 2 6 4. SM represents sum modulo 10. Adding 2, 2, 6 and 4 gives 14. Then, take modulo 10, the result is 4.
- The second expression inside the inner-most brackets is MAX 9 0 4 9. MAX represents maximum. The maximum value among 9, 0, 4 and 9 is 9.
- The third expression inside the inner-most brackets is MAX 2 8 6 3. Again, the maximum value among 2, 8, 6 and 3 is 8.
- The fourth expression inside the inner-most brackets is SM 6 3 8 7. Adding 6, 3, 8 and 7 together gives 24. Modulo 10 the result is 4.
- The fifth and the sixth expressions inside the inner-most brackets are both MIN operations. MIN represents minimum. So, the minimum value among 9, 0, 5 and 0 is 0 for the fifth expression and 0 for the sixth expression as well (4, 6, 0, 2).
-The seventh expression inside the inner-most brackets is MAX 1 [MIN 2 9 6 8] 8 [MAX 5 0 8 5]. We've already defined MIN and MAX. MIN 2 9 6 8 gives 2 and MAX 5 0 8 5 gives 8. Replacing these values in the expression, it becomes MAX 1 2 8 8. This will yield 8.

Now, let's replace these results in the original expression and solve it step by step:

[SM 4 [SM 3 [MAX 4 8 8 9] [MAX 8 4 9 8] 3] [MAX [MAX 4 0 5 0] [MAX 8 2 8 0] 0 4] 1]

=> [SM 4 [SM 3 [MAX 9] [MAX 9] 3] [MAX [MAX 5] [MAX 8] 4] 1]

=> [SM 4 [SM 3 9 9 3] [MAX 5 8 4] 1]

=> [SM 4 [SM 3 9 9 3] 8 1]

=> [SM 4 21 8 1]

=> [SM 4 1 8 1]

=> [SM 14]

So, finally we get the value 4 as a result since SM 14 is equivalent to 4 (modulus 10).",4,7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the innermost SM operations:

[SM 8 6 9 5] equals (8 + 6 + 9 + 5) modulo 10 = 28 modulo 10 = 8.
Thus, the operation becomes:
[MIN [MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 [SM 9 9 2 7]] [MIN [MAX 1 4 9 0] 8 9 [SM 1 2 2 5]]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 [SM 4 0 7 5] [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN [MAX 3 2 1 3] [MAX 1 1 5 1] 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[SM 9 9 2 7] equals (9 + 9 + 2 + 7) modulo 10 = 27 modulo 10 = 7
The operation turns to:
[MIN [MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 7] [MIN [MAX 1 4 9 0] 8 9 [SM 1 2 2 5]]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 [SM 4 0 7 5] [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN [MAX 3 2 1 3] [MAX 1 1 5 1] 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[SM 1 2 2 5] equals (1 + 2 + 2 + 5) modulo 10 = 10 modulo 10 = 0
It becomes:
[MIN [MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 7] [MIN [MAX 1 4 9 0] 8 9 0]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 [SM 4 0 7 5] [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN [MAX 3 2 1 3] [MAX 1 1 5 1] 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[SM 4 0 7 5] equals (4 + 0 + 7 + 5) modulo 10 = 16 modulo 10 = 6
So, it changes to:
[MIN [MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 7] [MIN [MAX 1 4 9 0] 8 9 0]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 6 [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN [MAX 3 2 1 3] [MAX 1 1 5 1] 1 9] 7 6] 0]

Next, we can deal with the MAX operations:

[MAX 1 4 9 0] equals maximum of (1,4,9,0) = 9
So, we have:
[MIN [MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 7] [MIN 9 8 9 0]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 6 [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN [MAX 3 2 1 3] [MAX 1 1 5 1] 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[MAX 3 2 1 3] equals maximum of (3,2,1,3) = 3
It updates to:
[MIN [MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 7] [MIN 9 8 9 0]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 6 [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN 3 [MAX 1 1 5 1] 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[MAX 1 1 5 1] equals maximum of (1,1,5,1) = 5
Resulting in:
[MIN [MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 7] [MIN 9 8 9 0]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 6 [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN 3 5 1 9] 7 6] 0]

Next, we proceed with the MIN operations:

[MIN 7 9 [SM 3 8 9 7] equals minimum of (7,9,[SM 3 8 9 7]). But here [SM 3 8 9 7] equals (3 + 8 + 9 + 7) modulo 10 = 27 modulo 10 = 7. So, it becomes [MIN 7 9 7] = minimum of (7,9,7) = 7
Giving us:
[MIN 7 [MIN 9 8 9 0]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 6 [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN 3 5 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[MIN 9 8 9 0] equals minimum of (9,8,9,0) = 0
The operation will now be:
[MIN 7 0] 4 [SM [MIN 4 0 6 [MIN 0 5 6 6]] [MIN 3 5 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[MIN 4 0 6 [MIN 0 5 6 6]] becomes [MIN 4 0 6 0] = minimum of (4,0,6,0) = 0
So our expression is:
[MIN 7 0] 4 [SM 0 [MIN 3 5 1 9] 7 6] 0]

[MIN 3 5 1 9] equals minimum of (3,5,1,9) = 1
Thus, we get:
[MIN 7 0] 4 [SM 0 1 7 6] 0]

Now, let's complete our expression by performing the final SM and MIN operations:

[SM 0 1 7 6] equals (0 + 1 + 7 + 6) modulo 10 = 14 modulo 10 = 4
So, it updates to [MIN 7 0] 4 4 0]

[MIN 7 0] equals minimum of (7,0) = 0
Bringing our expression to:
0 4 4 0

So, finally:
This expression equals:

This reduces the expression to [SM [SM 3 [MIN 5, 6, 1, 8] 8 [MAX 27, 8, 0, 2]] [MAX [SM 6, 26, 1, 14], [MAX 7, 1, 6, 20], 8, 9] 4, 8].

Now, [MIN 5, 6, 1, 8] is equal to 1, [MAX 27, 8, 0, 2] takes the maximum, 27, [SM 6, 26, 1, 14] takes sum modulo 10, 7, and [MAX 7, 1, 6, 20] takes the maximum, 20. 

So, the expression becomes [SM [SM 3, 1, 8, 27] [MAX 7, 20, 8, 9] 4, 8].

Applying the SM operator on [SM 3, 1, 8, 27], you get 9 (3+1+8+27 = 39, then 39 modulo 10 = 9). Apply the MAX operator on [MAX 7, 20, 8, 9], you get 20.

So the expression now is [SM 9, 20, 4, 8].

- [SM 8 0 [MIN 7 1 6 4] [MAX 7 0 2 6]] here [MIN 7 1 6 4] gives us the minimum between 7, 1, 6 and 4 - which is 1. And, [MAX 7 0 2 6] gives the maximum between 7, 0, 2 and 6 which is 7. Therefore, the operation becomes [SM 8 0 1 7] which equals (8+0+1+7) modulo 10, i.e. 6.

Thus, the operation becomes [SM 9 0 9 5], which is (9+0+9+5) modulo 10, i.e. 3.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, let's simplify operations inside the innermost brackets. 

We have couple of MAX and MIN operators:

MAX 9 4 3 0 = 9 (Because 9 is the maximum number among all numbers in the bracket)

MAX 7 5 9 0 = 9 

MIN 9 8 1 8 = 1

SM 6 6 7 0 = (6+6+7+0) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9 (as we are using modulo 10, the results are limited to numbers in the range 0 to 9)

MAX 2 2 3 1 = 3

MAX 7 2 4 0 = 7 

MAX 9 3 7 0 = 9 

Now the expression looks like:

Next operations:

SM 7 3 7 9 = (7+3+7+9) mod 10 = 26 mod 10 = 6

MAX 4 9 7 5 = 9

This simplifies the expression to:

[MIN 5 6 [MIN 1 0 [MAX 9 0 8 [MIN 5 0 2 9]] [MAX 1 9 8 1]] [MIN 9 3 6 4]

Let's simplify further, calculating remaining MAX and MIN:

MAX 1 9 8 1 = 9 

MIN 5 6 [MIN 1 0 9 9] [MIN 9 3 6 4]

Calculate the remaining MIN:

MIN 1 0 9 9 = 0 

MIN 9 3 6 4 = 3

The expression now looks like:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can calculate partial expressions involving the SM operator.

[SM 4 7 0 7] = (4 + 7 + 0 + 7) % 10 = 18 % 10 = 8.

[SM 6 4 7 1] = (6 + 4 + 7 + 1) % 10 = 18 % 10 = 8.

[SM 0 7 5 7] = (0 + 7 + 5 + 7) % 10 = 19 % 10 = 9.

[SM 3 5 7 7] = (3 + 5 + 7 + 7) % 10 = 22 % 10 = 2.

Now the updated expression will be:

[MAX 5 [MIN [MAX 6 8 [MAX 5 3 3 8] 3] 1 5 [MIN [MAX 5 8 1 4] [MAX 5 0 5 7] 8 3]] [MIN [MIN 8 5 9 1] 9 0 [MIN 2 2 [MIN 9 1 3 2] 2]] 3]

Then we can calculate partial expressions involving the MAX and MIN operators.

[MAX 6 8 [MAX 5 3 3 8] 3] = MAX of [6, 8, 8, 3] = 8.

[MIN 8 5 9 1] = MIN of [8, 5, 9, 1] = 1.

[MIN 2 2 [MIN 9 1 3 2] 2] = MIN of [2, 2, 1, 2] = 1.

The updated expression is:

[MAX 5 [MIN 8 1 5 [MIN [MAX 5 8 1 4] [MAX 5 0 5 7] 8 3]] [MIN 1 9 0 1] 3]

We can now go on to simplify some more partial expressions:

[SM 1 8 1 4] = 4 (since we're doing sum modulo 10, 1 + 8 + 1 + 4 = 14 and 14 mod 10 = 4)

Then,

[MIN 0 4 8 8] = 0
[MIN 1 8 0 7] = 0

MIN 3 7 7 8 = 3
MAX 4 6 0 1 = 6
MIN 2 4 2 8 = 2

Now the expression looks like this:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 3 7 0 [SM 8 1 5 7]] 3 [SM 6 7 3 [SM 5 3 2 8]] 1] [SM 3 [MIN 4 6 [SM 8 6 7 0] 1] 9 [SM 2 3 6 [MAX 8 5 8 6]]] 0 5]

Now calculate the SM operations in the innermost brackets:

SM 8 1 5 7 = 21 mod 10 = 1
SM 5 3 2 8 = 18 mod 10 = 8
SM 8 6 7 0 = 21 mod 10 = 1
SM 2 3 6 = 11 mod 10 = 1

The expression now looks like this:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 3 7 0 1] 3 [SM 6 7 3 8] 1] [SM 3 [MIN 4 6 1 1] 9 [SM 1 [MAX 8 5 8 6]]] 0 5]

Now calculate the remaining MAX, MIN and SM operations:

MAX 3 7 0 1 = 7
MIN 4 6 1 1 = 1
MAX 8 5 8 6 = 8
SM 6 7 3 8 = 24 mod 10 = 4
SM 3 1 9 1 8 = 22 mod 10 = 2
SM 4 1 = 5

The expression now looks like this:

[MAX [MIN 7 4 1] 2 0 5] 

Calculate the remaining MIN operation:

MIN 7 4 1 = 1

Now the expression is:

[MAX 1 2 0 5] 

Finally, calculate the remaining MAX operation:

MAX 1 2 0 5 = 5

So the result is 5.",5,5

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[MAX [MIN [MAX 0 8 [MAX 9 2 2 6] [MAX 7 2 7 8]] [SM [SM 2 8 7 6] 4 [MIN 2 9 2 8] 3] 6 8] 1 [MIN [MAX 6 [MIN 7 9 2 0] 6 [MIN 5 2 1 7]] 2 [MAX 1 [SM 9 2 4 4] 2 [MAX 4 4 3 5]] 6] 1].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we need to calculate the results inside the innermost list by applying the appropriate operator for each list:

[MAX 0 8 [MAX 9 2 2 6] [MAX 7 2 7 8]] is MAX of 0, 8 and the maximum value of 9,2,2,6 and the maximum value of 7,2,7,8 which gives MAX of 0,8,9,8 which equals 9.

[SM 2 8 7 6] is SM of 2,8,7,6 which equals (2+8+7+6) mod 10 = 23 mod 10 = 3.

[MIN 2 9 2 8] is MIN of 2,9,2,8 which equals 2.

So the left branch of the outermost MAX operation becomes:

[MAX [MIN 9 [SM 3 4 2 3] 6 8] 1]

Now let's calculate the results inside innermost lists on the right branch of the outermost MAX operation.

[MAX 6 [MIN 7 9 2 0] 6 [MIN 5 2 1 7]] is MAX of 6 and the minimum value of 7,9,2,0 and 6 and the minimum value of 5,2,1,7 which equals MAX of 6,0,6,1 which equals 6.

[SM 9 2 4 4] is SM of 9,2,4,4 which equals (9+2+4+4) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9.

[MAX 1 [SM 9 2 4 4] 2 [MAX 4 4 3 5]] is MAX of 1 and 9 and 2 and the maximum value of 4,4,3,5 which equals MAX of 1,9,2,5 which equals 9.

So the right branch of the outermost MAX operation becomes:

[MIN [MAX 6 2 9] 6]

Now let's calculate the results inside lists at the second level of the tree.

The left branch is [MIN 9 [SM 3 4 2 3] 6 8], which is MIN of 9 and (3+4+2+3) mod 10 and 6 and 8 which equals MIN of 9,2,6,8 which is 2.

The right branch is [MAX 6 2 9], which is MAX of 6,2,9 which equals 9.

So the outermost MAX operation becomes:

[MAX 2 1 9 1] which is MAX of 2,1,9,1 which equals 9.

So the result of evaluating the given operation is 9.",9,2
