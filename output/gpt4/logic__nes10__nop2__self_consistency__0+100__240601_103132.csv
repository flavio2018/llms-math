A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical AND operation with false (&F) will always be false, regardless of the other operand. The logical OR operation with false (|F) will just give the other operand value, and logical OR operation with true (|T) will always be true, regardless of the other operand.

Given this, we'll apply these rules step-by-step on the expression:

((z & ((F | (((T & (((s | s) | s) & F)) | F) & T)) | F)) | (T & (T & ((!(w | (s | (T | ((u & F) | F))))) | F))).

First we simplify nested operations:

((s | s) | s) simplifies to 's' because (A or A) will be A itself.

((u & F) | F) simplifies to 'F' because (B and False) will be False and False or False will be False.

((!(w | (s | T))) | F) simplifies to 'F' because (C or True) will be True, its not will be False and False or False will be False.

(T & (((s | s) | s) & F)) simplifies to 'F' because A and False will result False regardless of A.

Also, (F | (F & T) simplifies to 'F' because False or (False and True) will result in False (since False and anything is False).

The same logic applies to the expression (T&(i&F)), it gives us False, and following the logic !(F) gives us True. Therefore (F&(T&(i&F))) gives us False.

In a similar way, any variable (& F) gives us False, then ((m & T) & (((F & F) | T) & F) | (F & (T & (i & F)))) gives us False.

- ""F & anything"" is False,

1. (F&F) simplifies to F
2. (F&T) also simplifies to F 
3. (T&F) simplifies to F

So, the expression now becomes:

(((((T|(F|((F|F)|F))))&T)|(!(T|(T|(!T)))))&F)&(F|T))

4. Now, (F|F) is F, so replace all (F|F) with F and (T|(!T)) will lead to T

This results in:

5. Replace (T|F) with T and (!T) with F to simplify further:

6. (T&T) simplifies to T

4. (!(F&T)) = True, since the input expression is false (from step 2) and we're denying false, making it true.
5. (((!T)&(((!T)&T)&(!(F&T))))&(F&T)) = False, since we've already established that (!T) and (F&T) are both false (from steps 1 and 2), so this whole thing is false as at least one component is false.
6. Therefore, the first part simplifies to: (F|F) = False, since we need at least one of them to be true.

7. (T|T) = True, since it only needs one component to be true to be true.
8. (r|(T|T)) = r|True = True, since True or anything equals True.
9. However, (False&True) = False, since you would need both of them to be true.

F | (T & (T | T)) is the same as F | (T & T), which simplifies to F | T, which results in T.

The first simplified formula is: d | (T & (!T)) & T.

The second simplified formula is: F & (w | T) | T.

Now consider, T & (!T) results in F.

The second formula results as F & T | T, which simplifies to F | T, which results in T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify the components inside (!(!(T|(g|T)))).
Since T or anything is always T (hence, T|(g|T) is T), the not of T is F (!T is F). Hence, !(!(T|(g|T))) simplifies to F.

Secondly, we can simplify the part inside ((F|(T|T))|(!((F&F)|(g&F))))).
Since F and F is always F (i.e., (F&F) as F), and anything and F is F as well (i.e., (g&F) as F), the not of F is T (!F as T). So, ((F&F)|(g&F)) simplifies to T.
Further, F or T or T (i.e., (F|(T|T))) is always T and T or anything is T. So, ((F|(T|T))|(!((F&F)|(g&F)))) simplifies to T.

Now, we take the terms T or anything is always T. So T|(F&(T|((F|(T|T))|(!((F&F)|(g&F)))))) simplifies to T.

Thus, we have ((a&((!(!(T|(g|T))))|(T|(F&(T|((F|(T|T))|(!((F&F)|(g&F))))))))) simplifies to (a & (F|T)) which simplified to a.

On the other hand, (a|a) simplifies to a and a and T (i.e., (a|a)&T)) simplifies to a.

- Then, a statement 'AND' with True (T&A or A&T) is always A (not changed).

Further simplification of (j|(T&T)) and ((!(F))&(!(T))) according to rules 2 and 5:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Since anything OR True is always True, (T|T) simplifies to T and (F|T) simplifies to T. So we get:
(F|(T&((o|(T&(u|((!F)&(T|T))))))|(F&(F&(F&(s|T)))))|(T|T).
2. Now let's simplify the boolean NOT operation, (!F), which converts F (False) to T (True). Therefore, (!F)&(T|T) simplifies to T&T, which is T. So, the formula now becomes:
(F|(T&((o|(T&(u|T))))|(F&(F&(F&(s|T))))))|(T|T).
3. Anything AND True remains the same. So the above expression simplifies to:
(F|(T&(o|(T&u))))|(F&(F&(F&s)))|(T|T).

(F|(T&(o|(T&u))))|(F&(F&F))|(T|T).
5. F&F simplifies to F. Therefore, the expression now becomes:
(F|(T&(o|(T&u))))|F|(T|T).

2. Similarly, the (F|F) simplifies to F. Therefore, (((((z&(z&T))&T)&T)|(F&(n|(F|T))))|z)&T) becomes (((((z&(z&T))&T)&T)|(F&(n|T)))|z)&T).

3. Meanwhile, (F|T) simplifies to T. Therefore, (((((z&(z&T))&T)&T)|(F&(n|T)))|z)&T) simplifies to (((((z&(z&T))&T)&T)|(F&n))|z)&T).

4. Now, looking at (z&T), because T is the identity for an AND operation, this simply simplifies to z. Therefore, (((((z&(z&T))&T)&T)|(F&n))|z)&T simplifies to ((((z&z)&T)&T)|(F&n)|z)&T).

5. Similarly, (z&z) will also simplify to z, giving the formula ((z&T)&T)|(F&n)|z)&T.

6. The AND operation is associative so you can rearrange the operation (z&T)&T to z&(T&T), which simplifies to z. So the formula now simplifies to z|(F&n)|z.

7. Also, F&n simplifies to F and using the identity rule for the OR operation, the formula simplifies to z|F|z which further simplifies to z.

8. Finally, looking at the main formula given, (T|(F&F)), this simplifies to T because F&F gives F and T|F gives T.

9. So, the main formula ((T|(F&F))&(x&z)) simplifies to T&x&z. Since AND operation is associative, it can be written as T&(x&z), which further simplifies to x&z because boolean ANDing any Boolean expression with T (true) gives the original Boolean expression.

3) Now consider '(((p|(T&((d|(F|F))&F)))|((((p&p)|F)&p)|p)|F)&F)'. Simplifying nested expressions for F|F and (d|F) gives '(p|(T&(d&F))|(((p|F)&p)|p|F)&F)'.
4) (d&F) equals F regardless of the value of d and (p|F) equals p for any value of p, simplifying the expression further to '(p|(T&F)|((p&p)|p)&F)'.
5) T&F equals F and p&p equals p hence, '(p|F|(p|p)&F)' is obtained. p|p is p, therefore, it simplifies to '(p|F|p&F)'. 
6) p&F gives F, resulting in the expression '(p|F|F)', which will simplify to p.

2. Considering this, the given expression becomes:

3. Now, we know that ""T & False"" is always False (an AND operation with False is always False), so it gives us:

   True & (True | (z & False & T) ) | !T. 

4. We can also see that ""False & T"" stays False and ""!T"" turns into False, so:

   True & (True | (z & False)) | False. 

5. (z & False) will be False, hence the expression can be simplified to:

Moreover, (!((b&F)|F)) is True since (b&F) is False and |F is False, so the not operation change it to True. Lastly, (b&b) is equivalent to b.

With all this simplifications we can simplify the expression to:

The expression (r & r) is equivalent to just r, so we can simplify it to:

2. Now, let's look at each part separately:

a) `T&T` is `T`.
b) `F&(!T&T)` is `F`, because `!T` would mean that the value of `T` is not true, which conflicts with the `&T` at the end, making the entire statement false.

- Something OR False (A|F) = A. Thus, ((j|F)|j) simplifies to (j|j).
- Anything OR True (A|T) = True. But here we see (F&T), which is False. False in OR with anything (A|False) results in A itself, so (a|F) simplifies to a. 
- The term (j|j) equals simply j. 
- Negation of False is True, so !F equals True.
- Something and True (A&T) simplifies to A itself. So (v&(l&a)) simplifies to (v&(l&a)) as no explicit True is involved.

1. Simplifying the constituents (!(((o&o)&F)|(w|((!F)|((j&j)|F)|(!(v&(l&a)))))), we get :

2. Inverting False is True, and anything AND True is True. So now our formula is :

7. Hence, the given complex formula becomes (j|j)|(F|j)|(j|F), which we can simplify to j as (j|F) is just j and (j|j) is also just j.

(!(((x|((((k|(F&(!T)))|F)|k)|(!(n&(p&(!(F|T)))))))&T)|((F&(m&F))|T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, these simplifications hold because of the following properties:

- F & x = F (False AND anything = False)
- T & x = x (True AND anything = itself)
- x | F = x (anything OR False = itself)
- x | T = T (anything OR True = True)
- !T = F (Not True = False)
- !F = T (Not False = True)

So, apply these rules in the formula:

(!(((x|((((k|(F&(!T)))|F)|k)|(!(n&(p&(!(F|T)))))))&T)|((F&(m&F))|T)))

Simplify inside the brackets:

- (F & (!T)) simplifies to F (since !T = F and False AND anything = False)
- (!(F | T)) simplifies to F (since F | T = T and !T = F)
- ((F & (m&F)) simplifies to F (since F AND anything = F)

So, the formula after simplification of inner brackets:

(!(((x|((((k|F)|F)|k)|(!(((n&p)&F)))))&T)|F|T)) 

Continue simplification:

- (k | F) simplifies to k (since anything OR False = itself),
- (((k | F)| F) | k) simplifies to k (since k or False = k and anything OR itself = itself)
- !(((n&p)&F)) simplifies to T (since (n&p) AND False = False and not False = True)

So, the formula becomes:

(!(((x|k|T)&T)|F|T))

We continue simplification:

- (x | k | T) simplifies to T (since anything OR True = True)
- ((x|k|T)&T) simplifies to T (since True AND True = True)
- ((T&F)|T) simplifies to T (since True OR anything = True)

So, the formula becomes: !T

Then, !T simplifies to F (since NOT True = False).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting with the easiest simplifications, we have:
1. !T is always False, because not True is False
2. v|T is always True, for any value of v, because anything or True is always True
3. !(!(v|T)) is the same as !(!T), which is the same as T (double negatives cancel)
4. w|w is always the same as w because anything or itself is just itself
5. T&F is always False, because True and False is always False
6. F&(r|T)) is always False, because False and anything is always False
7. F|F is always False, because False or False is always False
8. T&F is always False, because True and False is always False
9. anything&F is always False, because anything and False is always False

So if we replace all this in your expression, we get:

((!T)&((!(!(v|T)))&((((((w&((w|w)&T))&T)|((T&(F&(r|T)))|F))|(F&F))&F)&F)))

Becomes:

((F)&((T)&(((((w&(w&T))&T)|(False|F))|(F&F))&F)&F))
((F)&((T)&(((((w&w)&T)|False)|(False))&F)&F))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify inside the parentheses. 
Since anything OR False will be the thing itself, T|F simplifies to T. 
Similarly, anything AND False will be False, so F&T simplifies to F. 

So ((T|F)|((((p&((j&(T|(f&(!T))))|(T|(!(!(F&T))))))&F)|T)|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))) simplifies to:
(T|((((p&((j&(T|(f&(!T))))|(T|(!(!F))))))&F)|T)|(!((F&T)&T)))

Anything OR True will be True, so T|anything simplifies to T. T|(f&(!T)) simplifies to T. That simplifies the previous to:
(T|((((p&((j&T)|(T|(!(!F))))))&F)|T)|(!((F&T)&T))). 

!(!anything) is the same as anything, so we simplify !(!F) to F. That simplifies the previous formula to:
(T|((((p&((j&T)|(T|F))))&F)|T)|(!((F&T)&T))).

Since anything OR False is the thing itself, T|F simplifies to T. So we have following simplification:
(T|((((p&((j&T)|T)))&F)|T)|(!((F&T)&T))).

Again anything AND False equals False, so use (p&((j&T)|T))&F to simplify to F. And (F & T) simplifies to F. So we have:
(T|(F|T)|!F).

Anything OR True simplifies to True, so we have T|!F. 

Anything OR the negation of itself simplifies to True. So T|!F simplifies to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The best way to simplify a logic formula is to follow the laws of Boolean algebra. Here are a few essentials ones:
- Double negation: NOT (NOT a) = a.
- Identity law: a OR TRUE = TRUE and a AND TRUE = a.
- Null law: a OR FALSE = a and a AND FALSE = FALSE.
- Complement law: a OR NOT a = TRUE and a AND NOT a = FALSE.
- Dominance law: a OR a = a and a AND a = a.

Now let's simplify the formula step-by-step utilizing these laws:

(!((!(!(F|((T|(!(h|T)))|(((q&T)&T)|T)))))&F)&((!(T&((u|T)|T)))&F)).

First, let's simplify each ((a|T)|T) and ((a&T)&T) using the Identity law and the Dominance law. For ((a|T)|T), a OR TRUE is always TRUE. For ((a&T)&T), a AND TRUE is equal to a. So:

!((!(!(F|T|q|T)))&F)&((!((u|T)&T))&F).

This can be further simplified as:

!((!(!F))&F)&(!u&F).

Using double negation law, the expression simplifies to:

!((F&F)&(!u&F)), which is further simplified as:

!(F&(!u&F)).

The expression can be simplified to:

!(!u&F).

Applying the Null law, the final simplified logic formula is:

((((T|((k&(F|((!(F|F))|F)))&F))|(!(w|(!((!((s&s)|T))|F)))))&T)&(F|(u&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T or anything is always T because the operation ""or"" always gives as result True when at least one of the operands is True. So the first part of the formula could be simplified as follows:

   T|((k&(F|((!(F|F))|F)))&F) => T

2. The expression F or F is always F (because ""or"" operation produces True only when at least one of the operands is True). So (!(F|F)) implies !F which is T (due to the operation ""not"" which inverts the logical value of F). The next part of the formula could be simplified as follows:

   !(F|F) => T
   Hence, F|((!(F|F))|F) => F|(T|F) => T
   Consequently, k&(F|((!(F|F))|F)) => k&T => k

3. Anything and F is always F, because an ""and"" operation always returns False when at least one of the operands is False. Hence:

   k&F => F

4. Something or its negation is always T. Moreover, s&s is equivalent to s (because anything and itself remain the same). Hence, we have:

   w|(!((!((s&s)|T))|F)) => w|(!((!((s))|F) => w|(!(!s)) => w|s 

5. F|(u&F) is always F (because an ""and"" operation with F always returns False and ""or"" operation with F remains the same). Hence, the last part of the logic formula could be simplified as follows:

   F|(u&F) => F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!((T|(T&F))&(T|(l|T))) can be simplified as !(T& T) which equals F
    reason: T|F = T (since T or anything equals T). Now T and anything where anything is a known true value yields T. So (T&(T|(l|T))) yields T. If we negate a true statement, we get false. Hence this expression will be !((T&T)&T) = !(T&T) = !(T) = F

2. Therefore we replace this in the main expression and get ((T|((((((s&s)&s)&s)|(w&F))&(s&s))&(F&F)))&(T|(l&F)))

3. (s&s) is equal to s. So, ((((((s&s)&s)&s)|(w&F))&(s&s))&(F&F)) equals (((s&s)|F)&(s&F))
    reason: Taking s&s will be equal to s. And if you take Anything & F this equals F.

4. (F&F) is equal to F. So ((T|((((((s&s)&s)&s)|(w&(!((T|(T&F))&(T|(l|T))))))&(s&s))&(F&F))) equals to ((T|((((s&s)|F)&F))&(T|(l&F))). 

5. (s&F) is equal to F. So ((T|(((s&F)&F))&(T|(l&F))) equals to ((T|(F&F))&(T|(l&F))).

6. (F&F) is equal to F. So ((T|(F&F))&(T|(l&F))) equals to ((T|F)&(T|(l&F))). 

7. ((T|F) equals to T. So ((T|F)&(T|(l&F))) equals to (T&(T|(l&F))).

3. 'T' OR 'F' always returns True because ""OR"" yields true when atleast one of the statements is true. Therefore, (T|F) simplifies to 'T'.

Also, logical or operation with True results in True, regardless of the other operand (T | T = T, T | F = T, T | h = T). Therefore, z | T, m | T and h | T all simplify to T.

The logical not operator simply reverses the value. Therefore !T | F is F | T, which is T.

2. Again apply the logic for T & F scenario and for F & variable (since variable&F will always equals to F) and change T|F and F|T situations (these will always be T). Ignore ! operator before the T since false of T is F. 

So the expression becomes:

((!(F&(F|T)))|(F|F))

3. Proceed to compute the And and Or operations. After that operation carried out, the expression becomes:

- And l|F&T simplified further to l|F as F&T is False.
- F|(!(!F)) results in F | T which is True. So (!((F|(!(!F)))&T)) simplifies to !T which is False.

Consider ""T | F"", which is always True (T). 

""F | F"" remains False (F), ""x & F"" is always False (F).

Next, ""&F"" will lead to false (F) value regardless of 'a'. 

So, ""!(a | (a & a) & F)"" becomes ""!F"" which is True (T).

So, ""T | T"" appears as True (T).

Consider 'd | F', again that is just 'd'.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, look at the constants in the formula. We know that ""something & F"" is always F. So that simplifies parts of the formula straight away. We also know that ""T | T"" is always True. So the formula can be simplified as follows:

((((((((j&j)|(j&T))|j)&j)&((F|!F))&(!F))&(j&j))&F)&(F|!T))

Also, ""Something | T"" is always True. And ""something | F"" is always the 'something' itself. ""Not False"" is True and ""Not True"" is False. So the formula can be simplified further:

(((((((j&j)|T)|j)&j)&T)&T)&F)&F

""Someting & T"" is the 'something' itself. ""Something | Something"" is always the first 'something'. So we won't need the duplicate ands and ors. It becomes:

(((j&T)&T)&F)&F

Which then further simplifies to:

(F&F)

Further simplifying it to just:

F",F,F
