0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The OR operator (|) gives True if any one of the operands is True. Since we are doing OR with True (h or T) it will always be True. Therefore, the simplification yields T (True).",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The symbol ""|"" stands for ""OR"". Therefore, (F|T) stands for ""False OR True"". According to the truth table of OR operator, if any one of the operand is True, the result is True. Hence, (F|T) simplifies to True (T).",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression is (v&T).

As per the semantics of logical and (denoted by '&'):
- If any one of the inputs is false (F), the result is false.
- If both inputs are true (T), the result is true.

Given that T (True), this implies that the value of the whole expression (v&T) will be identical to the value of 'v', because the expression is either (v&True), equivalent to 'v' itself. Therefore the simplified form will be:

v",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The symbol | denotes logical OR operation. In logical OR operation, if either of the values is True, then the entire expression is True.

o|F 

can be interpreted as ""o OR False"". 

Because OR operation results in True if either of the values is True, the False value here doesn't contribute to the result, because False OR something would just be that something.

So the simplified logic formula is: 

o.",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical 'or' operation | means that if either of the connecting statements is true, then the result is true. So, in our case, we have q or False. If q is true, then true or false is true. If q is false, then false or false is false. So the result of (q|F) is just equal to q.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In a logical ""and"" operation, if any of the values is False, the overall result is False. Therefore, regardless of the value of f, (f&F) will always be False. In symbolic notation, it simplifies to F.",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The statement is ""w&w"", which means ""w and w"". Since both expressions are the same, the simplification can be made, and the simplified version will only be ""w"" because the result would be the same as the input value.",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula ""b | F"" represents ""b OR False"". According to the laws of Boolean logic, anything OR False is equivalent to the original value. So, the simplification of this formula would be just ""b"".",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (o|o) is a logical OR operation. Given that the same operand is used on both sides, this indicates that this operation will return the value of 'o'. Regardless of whether 'o' is True or False, the OR operation will always return its value. Hence, the simplified formula is 'o'.",o,o
