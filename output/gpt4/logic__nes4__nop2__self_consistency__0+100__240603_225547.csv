3. With an AND operation, if one value is False the result automatically becomes False, regardless of the other value. Therefore, (c&F) simplifies to F. So, the whole formula becomes (j|((j&(!F)))).
4. Since the NOT (or !) inverts a value, (!F) turns into T. Making the whole simplification (j|((j&T))).

Next, (h|F) is equivalent to just h itself, as False combined with anything using ""or"" operator is just the other thing. Therefore, ((h|F)|h)) simplifies to h.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","'t|F' yields the value of 't'. This is because 'or' operation produces True result if at least one of the operands is True. So, with 'F' always False, the result relies on value of 't'. 
't|t' is always 't', because 'or' operation with the same values always yields the value itself.
So, you end up with '(t|t)&T', which simplifies to 't&T'. 

'And' operation produces True result only if both operands are True. So, with 'T' always True, the result relies on value of 't'. The above expression can be hence simplified to just 't'.

In the second part, '!F&F', as 'F&F' is False, and 'not' operation inverts the boolean result. So '!(F&F)' will be 'T' (boolean True).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (F|T) signifies a comparison between false and true. According to the rules of logical operators, the logical OR'|' operator brings out the value true when at least one of the operands is true. Therefore the value of (F|T) is T.

The expression (F&T) results in false because according to the rules of logical operators, the logical AND'&' operator gives out the value true only when both operands are true. Since it is false and true in this case, the output is false. Therefore, the expression simplifies to: (T|!(F|T)). 

Simplifying it further, the (F|T) expression is true like we have discussed above. Thus, it results in (T|!T).
