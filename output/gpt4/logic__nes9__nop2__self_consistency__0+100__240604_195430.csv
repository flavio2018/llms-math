2.

This simplifies the formula to:

F&T is always F, because False and anything is False.
T&F is also always F.

Thus, our equation simplifies down to:

((((T&F)&T)|!(T|F|h&(F|x&F))))|F

Then we could do more simplifications.

T&F is F, because anything AND False is False.
F|x&F becomes F because anything AND False is False.

Thus, our equation simplifies further down to:

((F&T)|!(T|F|h&F))|F

Continuing our simplifications,

F&T is F.
h&F is F, because anything AND False is False.

So, our equation simplifies further to:

(F|!(T|F|F))|F

Then we simplify T|F|F to T because anything OR with False remains unchanged.

Now, our equation is:

(F|!(T))|F

But !T is the negation of True, which is False. So, this simplifies to:

(F|F)|F

Thus, all the inner brackets simplify to d|F|T = T, because ""or"" operation with True always yields True. 

- Secondly, let's simplify the brackets that have only True and False values: T|F = T and T&F = F. Thus we get !F = T since ""not"" changes False into True. So, T&T = T.

- Using the rules we've just applied the expression simplifies to T&T = T.

- Then the expression at the far right F|(F&F) simplifies to F|F = F because ""or"" operation with False always yields False.

Step 2: Now the next step is to simplify (((F|T)&(i|((((((i&(T|T))|(i&(T|F)))|(i&T))|F)&(F|(!F)))|T))). Breaking this up, we first analyze F|T. In logical OR operation, (A|B) is true if either A or B is true. F|T simplifies to T.

2. Not true (!T) is always False (F) and r & F is always r, and r | F is also always r. So, we can simplify (!T) to F and r & F and r | F to r in the formula.
3. Also, any value ""or"" with True (a | T) is always True (T); any value ""and"" with True (a & T) is always ""a"". So we can simplify any ""or"" with T in the formula to T and any ""and"" with T in the formula to ""a"".
4. Look for any value ""and"" with False (a & F) - this is always False and any value ""or"" with False (a | F) - this is always ""a"". We can simplify any ""and"" with F in the formula to F and any ""or"" with F to ""a"".
5. Any repetition of ""or"" and ""and"" with the same variable (like a | a or a & a) can always be simplified to ""a"". 

Applying these steps to your formula, we can simplify:

((b|((b&((b&(b|b))&b))|b))|(((b&(w|(((r|(!T))|((r&T)&r))|T)))|F)|b))

((b|((b&((b&b)&b))|b))|(((b&(w|(((r|F)|r)|T)))|F)|b))

Then (r|F) simplifies to r so we get:

2. ((T | (F & v & m & F)) & F) = F (The part inside the parentheses evaluates to F (since F & anything = F). So, this simplifies to (T | F) & F = T & F = F).

3. Rewriting the expression using the above concepts: ((T|(!(((o|(T&F))|T)&(F&T))))&(F|F))
   
4. Here T&F = F, So the expression becomes: ((T|(!((o|F)|T)&F))&(F|F))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, remember that:
- Anything AND False (&F) is always False.
- Anything OR True (|T) is always True.
- The negation of True (!T) is False and the negation of False (!F) is True.

1. The elements (T&F), (T|F), (T&F) simplify to F, T, F respectively.

Substitute these values in the equation:

(F&((((m|(F|(!T)))&T)&((((((p&T)|T)&!(T))|T)&F)&T))&F)).

2. After substitifying all T&F and T|F values with F and T respectively, we have:

(F&((((m|(F|F))&T)&((((((p&T)|T)&F)|T)&F)&T))&F)).

Which simplifies to:

(F&(((m|F)&T)&(((((p&T)|T)&F)|T)&F)&T))&F).

3. We can further simplify this since anything OR False (|F) is always the other element. Anything AND True (&T) is the value of the other element, so we get:

(F&((m&T)&(((p&T)&F)&F)&T)&F).

4. We can further simplify this with the rules mentioned before:

(F&(m&F)&F&T&F).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first thing we can note in the formula is that there are a couple of constants, true (T) and false (F), involved in some operations. Because of the meanings of logical operations, we can simplify these directly. 

- (!T) is obviously False because it's the negation of True. 

- ((F&T) adds to F because AND operation with False always returns False. 

- (T&T) is T because AND operation with True for both variables returns True. 

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

False|((!(m&(!False)))|(e|((z|(T&F))|T))). 
= False|((!(m&True))|(e|((z|False)|T))). 
= False|((!m)|(e|(z|T))). 

The part (z|False) can be simplified also, logical OR operates like this: if either or both inputs are True, result is True and if both inputs are False, result is False. So (z|False) is actually equivalent to z. Also, the similar operation (z|T), it will always return True, because OR operation with True always results in True.

False|((!m)|(e|(True))).

False|((!m)|True)
= (!m)|True.

No matter False or True of (!m), the final result is always True. So the whole formula simplified to True.",True,T

2. (T&(!(!T))) equivalent to (T&T) = T, since negation of False is True and T&T results True if both are True.
3. !(T&(!(!T))) equivalent to !T but T can't be false therefore it's False. 
4. F&(!F) equivalent to F, since False and anything is False. 
5. (F&(!F))|(T|(T|F))) equivalent to F|T = T, because anything OR True gives True.

Substitute these expressions into the original equation to get:

Further simplifying:

1. !(F) equivalent to T, since negation of False is True.
2. (T&F) equivalent to F, because True and False results False.
3. F&T equivalent to False, Any False condition with AND gives False.

Simplifying more:

1. !(F) equal to T, because negation of False is True.
2. (T&F) equal to False, because False and anything results False.

The next key rule to remember here is that anything OR F is equal to that value. In this case, (r|F) simplifies to r.

Let's rewrite the formula with all of these simplifications: ((r|F)&(F&(F&F))). 

By following the same principles mentioned above ((r|F) = r) and (F&F = F), the formula further simplifies to (r&F). We now know that anything AND F is equivalent to F, so (r&F) turns to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the boolean value false AND anything is false. This means that any expression enclosed with a false AND clause reduces to false.

Therefore, we have 

1. (F&(((F|T)&((T|F)&(F|T)))&T)) simplified to False
2. ((F&F))) simplified to False.

On the other side, boolean value true OR anything is true. Therefore: 

(F|T) = True, 

(T|F) = True. 

So we have:

1. (((F|T)&((T|F)&(F|T))) simplified to True

Secondly, we have to consider boolean value true AND anything is that anything. Therefore:

(T&(T|(F&False))) is:
T&T simplifies to True. 

These steps bring us to the following simplified formula:

(T|((T&True)&(!g&(T&T&False))))

Next, we know that the logical NOT of anything is the reverse of that thing. 

!g is just !g, we can't simplify it more. 

If we substitute the simplifications discussed, the expression 

!g&(T&T&False), is the same as !g & False, because anything AND False is False.

Finally we use the fact that False and anything is that anything.

So we bring the final simplified formula to: 

(T|((T&True)&False))

Removing redundant operators from the expression,

1. (T & True) reduces to T

2. T|False is the same as T

We are then left with: T | T which simplifies to T.

T|(F&((F|F)&(!F))) simplifies to T which is also True (as logical or operation is true when at least one of the operands is true).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, expressions with ""T"" and ""F"" in the form of ""T | x"", ""x | T"", ""F & x"" or ""x & F"" are simplifications known as identity laws: 

- (T | anything) gives True.
- (F | anything) gives the value of anything: F | T = T and F | F = F, 
- (F & anything) gives False.
- (T & anything) gives the value of anything: T & T = T and T & F = F,

Also, expressions in the form of ""!!x"" or ""(not not) x"" give ""x"" due to the law of double negation.

So, simplifying the formula using these steps:

- Replace (F | F) with F and T | x with T: 

((f&(f|F))&(F|(T|((F|(!F))))|(!(l|(!(F&T&F))))))

((f&(f|F)) &(F|(T|(!F))|(!(l|(!F))))).

- Replace F & x with F and F | x with x:

((f&f) &(F|(T|F)|(!(l|(!F)))))

is simplified to

6. T | F and  !T | F return True and False respectively, so we get (((n&(n|F))&n)|F)|T).
7. It becomes ((n&n)&n)|T)
8. Logical AND is idempotent so (n&n) is same as n and the formula becomes (n&n)|T.
9. Finally since anything logical OR'd with True is True, the final simplified output is T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) F&T will always be F. Similarly, any value or variable AND with F will be F. Hence, z|(F&T) simplifies to z. 

2) Now, we have z&z which simplifies to z, because any variable AND with itself will always remain the same.

3) Any variable AND with T remains the same so, z&T is just z.

4) The inner part of h|(F|(g&F)) can be simplified. As we know, any variable And with F gives F. So, g&F simplifies to F. Now, we have h|F which simplifies to h because h OR with F always yields h.

5) The term h&(h|h) simplifies to h. 

6) Now, we have (((h&F)|F)|T) which also simplifies to T because anything OR with T gives T.

7) The term z|(!T) simplifies to z|F which becomes z after simplifying.

8) Therefore, we have ((z&z)&(z|F)). Using previous logic, it simplifies to z&z which is z again.

9) Now, we have (z|(z&T)) where z&T simplifies to z according to point (3). Hence, the term simplifies to z|z which is z.

Overall, the formula simplifies to z. 
So, the entire logical formula is equivalent to z.",z,z

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's start simplifying from inmost expressions:

1. (F&T): It is equivalent to F as one operand is false.
2. (F&T)&F: Again equivalent to F as one of the operand is false.
3. (F&(T&F)): Simplifies to F as we're combing with logical and with a false.
   
Next, we simplify the other expressions.
   
1. (z|F): Simplifies to z as logical or with a false will not affect z. 
2. (F|T): Simplifies to T as logical or with a true will always be true. 
3. !(T&((z|F)|(F|T))): Entire expression inside Not simplifies to T&(z|T), which in turn simplifies to T, because T&anything = anything. Hence !(T) = False. 
4. (F&((T|T)|F)):  Always simplifies to false, as false and anything = false. 

Next, bring it together.

1. (!(T&(z|T)))|(F&False): Simplifies to False|False: As both operands for logical or are false, entire expression simplifies to False.

So 

((F&(T&((F&T)&F)))&((o&((!(T&((z|F)|(F|T))))&(F&((T|T)|F)))&F)))

simplifies to 

(F & False) = F. 

Hence, the simplified form would be F.",F,F

((v|((v|F)|F))&((h&(((((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Inside the formula, we have multiple operations with constant logic values. We can simplify these operations as follows:

   (v|F) equals to v, because or operation with False does not change the original value.
   
   (v|v) equals to v, because or operation with the same value is that value itself.
   
   (F&F) equals to F, because and operation with False results in False.
   
   (T&F) equals to F, because and operation with False results in False.
   
   (!F) equals to T, because not operation changes the value.
   
   (!T) equals to F, because not operation changes the value

2. Now, our equation becomes:
   
   ((v|(v|F)) & ((h & ((T&F) | F | F)) | F | T)) that simplifies to
   
   (v & (h & F | T))

3. The operation 'and' with False results in False and 'or' with True results in True:

   (v & (F | T)) simplifies to (v & T) 

4. And the 'and' operation with True does not change the original value, so it simplifies to v. 

Hence, (v & T) simplifies to v. Thus, ((v|((v|F)|F))&((h&(((((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)) simplifies to v.",v,v

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (w&w) simplifies to w (since it's the logical AND of the same value)
2. Any value AND True evaluates to the value itself, so remove T from (w&T) to result in w
3. T|ANYTHING simplifies to T (since True OR anything is always True), so question simplifies to (w&T)
4. F|(~F) is always True because it's False OR Not False, so ((F&(~(F|((j&F)&F)&T))) simplifies to F
5. Any value AND False simplifies to False, so (F&g) results in F
6. (a|(w|T)) is True because it's something OR True which always yields True
7. True OR False is always True, so whole ((a|(w|T))|F) equals to T
8. Anything AND False is always False, so (T&F) simplifies to F
9. False OR True is always True, so whole ((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T part equals to T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","We may start working from innermost expression to outer expression. Because T is where the logical and operation is true if both operands are true, and the logical or operation is true if at least one of the operands is true.

Note that F & anything gives F, and T & anything gives the value of that thing. Also note that T | anything gives T, and F | anything gives the value of that thing.

Let's start with ((d&(T&(T&F)))|T). T&F gives F, and then d&F gives F, so (d&(T&(T&F))) simplifies to F. Then F | T gives T.

Now, let's move to simplify (T&((((d&(T&(T&F)))|T)|T)|F)), which can be further simplified as T&((F|T)|T)|F)) and it will give (T&T)&F which in turn gives T&F and finally results in False.

The last part to simplify is ((i&((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i))|i), which can be simplified to ((i&((i&((q&T)|T))&i))|i) which gives us ((i&((i&q)&i))|i) which along with the second rule results in either (T|i) or (F|i) which in turn results in either T or i.

2. T & F again gives F. So, (((T&F)&T)&F) becomes F.

3. Now see (F&((T|F)&(x&F))). As x&F is always F and T|F is always T, this expression simplifies to F & (T & F) = F & F = F.
