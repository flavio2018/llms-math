A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we'll go through the constants:
(!T) is equivalent to F (because not true is false).
(T&F) is equivalent to F (because true and false is false).
(F|F) is equivalent to F (because false or false is false).

Now let's simplify the equation step by step:

(((z|((!T)|((T&F)&(F|F))))|z)&(z&((z&T)|F))) implies
((z|(F|(F&F))|z)&(z&(z|F))) (substituting !T = F, T&F = F, F|F = F).

Now F&F is equivalent to F.
And (z|F) is equivalent to z (because any literal or False is the literal itself).

So, the equation now implies
((z|(F)|z)&(z&z)) which can be simplified to
(z&(z&z)) as F|(anything) = anything and z|z = z.

4. So, F | (F | !F) simplifies to T since we replaced (F | !F) with T in step 3, so it becomes F | T, which is T.

Now, let's substitute these results into the original formula:

2. F | F simplifies to F because anything | F is F.

3. We consider '!T & T' which is always False (as True and False is False). And there is '!F | T' which is True. So, we have now (!((T)&((F)|True)))).

5. Now the expression becomes '!((T) & (True))'.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!(F|F)) can be simplified to (!F) because both values in the OR operation are False. Therefore, the expression becomes:

2. Then, (!(!F)) simplifies to (F) because you're negating a negation. So now the expression is:
(!((!T)&(F|(!(T&(T&F))))).

3. (T&(T&F)) simplifies to (T&F). If we substitute this into expression, we get:

4. Here, the AND function with False returns False, so (T&F) simplifies to (F). After substituting this value, we have:

5. The not operator (!) turns True into False and False into True, so negating False (!F) gives us True (T). Substituting this, we get:

6. As the logical disjunction OR (|) operation between any value and True will result in True, (F|T) simplifies to T. Now, we substitute this in the expression and get:
(!((!T)&T)).

7. The not operator makes (!T) into (F), and the resulting expression is:
(!(F&T)).

8. If we use AND operation between True and False then it gives us False, so (F&T) simplifies to F:

- Logical false and false (F&F) is also False (F).
- Hence the logical expression (((F|F)&F) evaluates to False (F).
- The subexpression (l&F) is False, and False or true (F|T) is True (T).

2. Continue simplifying:

   - (T): No change.
So next we have:

3. Further simplification:
   - (o&T): Since '&' returns true only if both literals are true and as we do not have a constant Boolean value this cannot be further simplified.
   - T&F: Since ‘and’ statement returns True only if both of the literals are True. Here, since 'False' is there, the result will be False.

4. Continuing:
   - q|F: Since ‘or’ statement returns True if any of the literals is true. In this case the literal 'q' is not definite and hence cannot be simplified further.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. There is a logical formula (o|F), which means logical OR between o and False. Regardless of the value of o (true or false), this logical OR will always give the result of o (if o is true, then result is true; if o is false, then result is false). So, (o|F) simplifies to o.
2. Similarly, (T|T) will always result in True. Hence, (F|(T|T)) becomes (F|T) which simplifies to True (a logical OR with true always results to true regardless of the other value).
3. Therefore, ((((F|(T|T))&F)|F)&T) simplifies to ((True&F)|F)&T, which further simplifies to (F|F)&T, to F&T and finally to False (because logical AND with false always gives False).
4. The given formula transforms into ((((o&((o|F)|o))|o)&T)|((((F|(T|T))&F)|F)&T)) to ((((o&(o|o))|o)&T)|F), further simplifies to ((o|o)&T)|F to ((T&o)|F), finally simplifying to T|F or True (in this case, regardless of the value of o, if we have a T (True) and F (False), their logical OR will amount to True).

- Similarly, (F&T) is always False so the expression becomes:

- T|(F&((F&T)|F)) simplifies to T|F which is always True.

2. So, (a & !T) = (a & False). The logical AND operation with False always gives False no matter what the value of 'a' is.

3. Therefore, (a & !T) simplifies to False.

4. Next, analyze the second half of the given formula, (((F & (F|F)) & (F & F) & F) & (w & F)). Since 'F' or False with any logical operations (either AND or OR) always results in False, this entire formula equates to False.

5. So, (!(False)) = True, because the negation of False is True.

6. Therefore, the whole formula ((a & !T) | (!(False)) simplifies to (False | True) which is True because the logical OR operation with True always gives True regardless of the other operand.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the ""not"" (!) logic operation inverts the value of the operand. Therefore, for the part of the formula ""(F|T)"", the result is True since 'or' operator returns True if either of the operand is True. Inverting this with ""not"" results in False.

Then, let's simplify the ""and"" (&) sections. True & True results in True but anything & False will result in False. 

Now the ""or"" (|) logic operator results in True if either of its operands are True. 

So the formula can be simplified as follows:

Step 1: 
((T&(T|(!(T)))|(F&(T&(F&(T|F))). --> Resolved not operator

Step 2:
(T&(T|F))|(F&(T&F)). --> Resolved and operator

Step 3: 
(T&(T))|(F&F). --> Resolved or operator

Since ""T & !F"" gives ""T"" and ""t & F"" gives ""F"". Hence, the equation simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value logically ANDed with False (F&T) gives False i.e. F (F&T becomes F).
2. Anything logically OR'd with False is the original value (F|F), so we can simplify it to F.

4. Anything logically OR'd with False is the original value. Therefore, (((!(p&F))&T)|F)|(F|(x&((F&T)|F)))) simplifies to (((!(p&F))&T)|F)|F which is ((!(p&F))&T)|F. 
5. Further simplification of (!(!(p&F))) denotes that anything ANDed with False gives False. So, (p&F) is F and the negation (!F) is True. Hence, this simplifies to (T&T) or T.

- `T & T` would result in `T`, because and operation (denoted by `&`) between two true values is always true.
- `(w & T)` would result in `w`, because and operation with true value wouldn't affect the original value.
- This formula is `((((w& T)| w)| F)& w)...`, replacing the innermost parentheses with `w` we have `(((w | w)| F)& w)...`.
- `w | w` would result in `w`, because or operation (denoted by `|`) between two same values is the same value.
- `(((w | w)| F)& w)...` then becomes `((w | F)& w)...`.
- `w | F` would result in `w`, because or operation with false value wouldn't affect original value.
- `((w | F)& w)...` then becomes `(w & w)...`.
- `w & w` would simplify to `w`, as and operation between two same values is the same value.

Similarly, solve the rest of the formula (parentheses on the right side): 

-  `(F|(F|F))` results `F`, because or operation between two false values is always false.
-  `((F|(F|F))&T)` then becomes `(F&T)`, again and operation between False and True values is always false.
-  `((F|(F|F))&T)|F` then becomes `F|F` which results as `F`.
