A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify within each set of parentheses:
+5*a*b*x*y - 95*a*b*x*y = -90*a*b*x*y
+78*a*b*x*y - 48*a*b*x*y = +30*a*b*x*y

Taking the modulo 100 of the coefficients, we get:
-90*a*b*x*y = -90 mod -100 = -90*a*b*x*y
+30*a*b*x*y = +30 mod 100 = +30*a*b*x*y

Second, sum up the simplifications:
-90*a*b*x*y + 30*a*b*x*y = -60*a*b*x*y 

Taking modulo -100 of the coefficient, we get:
-60 mod -100 = -60

So, the simplified form of the given algebraic expression is -60*a*b*x*y.",-60*a*b*x*y,-60*a*b*x*y
