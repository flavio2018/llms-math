A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we simplify the (T&F) value which is False(because it's an and operation both should be true to get true) and (F&F) is False (because at least one value is false), so ""f&T"" becomes ""f&True"" and the ((T|F)&(F&F)) becomes ""True"", so our formula now looks like: ((f&True)|F)&(True|T).

2. In the equation ""(f&True)"", the ""and"" operation here means the resulting value will be whatever the value of ""f"" is, as ""and"" operation with True yields the other operand. So this part simplifies to ""f"".

   The (True|T) simplifies to True because an ""or"" operation with at least one True operand yields True, no matter what the other operand is. Therefore, our formula is transformed into: (f|F)&True.

3. For the ""(f|F)"", the ""or"" operation here means the resulting value will be always True, as ""or"" operation with False yields the other operand. Therefore, the formula now becomes: True&True.

2. We can also simplify ""(g|F)&F"". In this case, for the ""and"" operator, we have one expression as false: F. Therefore, the whole expression is again False, so ""(g|F)&F"" is also ""F"" or False.

(q|F)|(q&((q&q)&q)).

3. Again, 'q|F' is 'q', so the expression becomes:

q|(q&((q&q)&q)).

4. Also, any value and'ed with itself is equal to the original value. Therefore, '(q&q)' is 'q'. Thus, we simplify (q&q)&q to:

q|(q&q).

5. Again, '(q&q)' is 'q', so our expression simplifies to:

q|q

A: Let's think step-by-step.","A false condition (F) in a logical 'and' (&) conjunction makes the whole statement false. So, wherever you see something like ""F & anything"", that whole part becomes false (F), because one falsity makes the entire conjunction false.

That leaves us:


((F&F)&((l&F)|(T|(F&F))))

Next, a true condition (T) in a logical 'or' (|) disjunction makes the whole statement true, because for an 'or' operation, if one of the components is true, it doesn't matter what the other components are. The disjunction is true.

So, '(T|F)' gets simplified to 'T' regardless of what 'F' says.

After replacing (j&(F|F)) with F in (p|(j&(F|F))) we get (p|F), which simplifies to p because the logical OR of any value with False is the same value.

Now, look at the clause ((l&T)&F). The logical AND of any value with True is the same value, so (l&T) simplifies to l. Thus, ((l&T)&F) simplifies to (l&F), which simplifies to F because the logical AND of any value with False always results in False.

The negation of False, denoted by !F, is True.

Replace !((l&T)&F) with True, and after using above results, the whole expression becomes: (p | True), which is always True, regardless of the value of p. Therefore, the simplified formula is T (True).",T,T

So, the formula is ((z & True) | (F & ((T & T) & (F & T)))).

z & True simplifies to z, because any value AND True remains the same value.

On the other side of the OR operator, we have T & T, which simplifies to True.

Continuing with this clause, F & T simplifies to False, because False AND any value lead to False.

The whole second part of the OR operation ((T & T) & (F & T)) simplifies to F, because it becomes (True & False), which leads to False.

((o|(o&(o&o)))|((!(h|T))&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, in the first bracket o|(o&(o&o)) it would be simplified to o. The explanation is that (o&o) = o, and then (o&o) = o, and finally o|o = o.

Secondly, we can see h|T which as a logical OR operation is always T, because OR equals true if either of the operand(or both) is true, so it doesn't matter what the value of h is, thus (h|T) = T.

Thirdly, (T or True) being negated is always F, because logical not inverts the value, and the logical AND of anything with false F is also F. This is because the AND operation equals true if and only if both operands are true, so !(h|T) & F is equal to !(T) & F, which is equal to F & F, which is ultimately F.

Finally, when we do OR operation for o and F, we get o back as the result. This is because, as explained above, the OR operation equals true if either of the operand (or both) is true, so if 'o' is true, 'o' is the result, if 'o''s false, F is the result.

So, ((o|(o&(o&o)))|((!(h|T))&F)) simplifies down to o.",o,o

The operation ""True | T"" will also result in True regardless of whether T is True or False. The operation ""False & T"" will result in False regardless of whether T is True or False.

The operation ""True & T"" can either be True or False. But it doesn't matter what it results in, because in the next step it will be performing ""and"" operation with False. And ""True & False"" or ""False & False"" will always result in False.
