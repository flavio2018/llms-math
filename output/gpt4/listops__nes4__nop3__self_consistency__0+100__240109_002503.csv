A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, let's resolve all MIN and SM operators inside each MAX operator.

1. [MIN 1 4 3] = 1
2. [MIN 3 1 2] = 1
3. SM from step 1 and step 2 = [SM 1 9 1] = (1 + 9 + 1) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1 
4. [MIN 3 6 0] = 0
5. [MIN 0 9 0] = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","From left to right, assuming all the operations are performed in the order of precedence from left to right according to normal mathematical convention:

First, let's calculate all the SM operations. It yields the summation of all numbers involved, mod 10. 
[SM 6 7 6] equals (6+7+6) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
[SM 7 3 1] equals (7+3+1) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
[SM 6 9 3] equals (6+9+3) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8
[SM [MAX 1 4 2] 6 [MAX 2 2 8]] is more complicated, so we break it down further:
[MAX 1 4 2] is the maximum of 1, 4, and 2, which is 4. 
[MAX 2 2 8] is the maximum of 2, 2, and 8, which is 8. 
So, [SM [MAX 1 4 2] 6 [MAX 2 2 8]] equals [SM 4 6 8] which equals (4+6+8) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8.

So now our expression looks like this:
[SM [MIN [SM 9] 2 [SM 1]] 8 [MIN [SM 8] [MAX 0 4 6] 6]] [MAX 4 [MIN 6 [MAX 1 5 6] [MAX 9 4 1]] [SM 8]] 0.

Next, let's calculate the MAX operations. The MAX operator gives the maximum number among the numbers:
[MAX 0 4 6] equals the maximum of 0, 4, and 6, which is 6.
[MAX 1 5 6] equals the maximum of 1, 5, and 6, which is 6.
[MAX 9 4 1] equals the maximum of 9, 4, 1, which is 9.

So now our expression looks like this:
[SM [MIN [SM 9] 2 [SM 1]] 8 [MIN [SM 8] 6 6]] [MAX 4 [MIN 6 6 9] [SM 8]] 0.

Next, let's calculate the MIN operations:
[MIN [SM 9] 2 [SM 1]] equals the minimum of 9, 2, 1 which is 1. 
[MIN [SM 8] 6 6] equals the minimum of 8, 6, 6 which is 6. 
[MIN 6 6 9] equals the minimum of 6, 6, 9 which is 6. 

So now our expression simplifies to:
[SM 1 8 6] [MAX 4 6 8] 0.

Finally, let's calculate the remaining SM and MAX operations:
[SM 1 8 6] equals (1+8+6) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5.
[MAX 4 6 8] equals the maximum of 4, 6, and 8, which is 8. 

So our final expression is:
5 8 0.

As we have three numbers here, and no remaining operators, the problem is ambiguous. The numbers could be concatenated to form the number 580, they could form a list with the elements 5, 8, and 0, or one could argue that further binary operators should be applied between the numbers. Since the question is ambiguous, we cannot single out a definite solution from this point.",The problem is ambiguous as the final expression is 5 8 0 with no remaining operators.,0

- [MIN 9 7 1] = 1
- [SM 5 4 0] = 9
- [SM 9 9 3] = (9+9+3)%10 = 1
- [MAX 6 9 5] = 9
- [MAX 0 4 0] = 4
- [MAX 9 0 9] = 9

After these calculations the expression looks like this:
[MIN [MAX [SM 0 2 5] 7 [SM 1 5 1]] [SM [SM 9 9 2] 3 [MIN 4 4 9]] 2]

Now, let's further simplify it:
- [SM 0 2 5] = (0+2+5)%10 = 7
- [SM 1 5 1] = (1+5+1)%10 = 7
- [SM 9 9 2] = (9+9+2)%10 = 0
- [MIN 4 4 9] = 4 

We further substitute the above, and the expression is now:
[MIN [MAX 7 7 7] [SM 0 3 4] 2]

Further simplification gives:
- [MAX 7 7 7] = 7
- [SM 0 3 4] = (0+3+4)%10 = 7

Now, resolve the SM operators one by one, always remembering that SM is sum modulo 10:
SM 3 4 6 = 3, replace it in the expression:
[SM 2 [SM 2 3 6 3] 0]] [SM [SM [SM 4 8 1] [MIN 7 7 6] 4] 8 [MIN [MAX 7 7 1] 4 [SM 2 4 4]]]].

Now, solve the next SM, SM 2 3 6 3 = 4, replace this value:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the value inside the SM operations: 

- SM 1 6 1 = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8
- SM 5 3 5 = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 (but we take 3 because 13 mod 10 = 3)
- SM 8 4 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 (but we take 4 because 14 mod 10 = 4)
- SM 3 0 2 = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5

Now the expression looks like this:

MIN 4 MIN MAX 8 8 MIN 4 2 6 MAX 3 4 2 8 MIN 2 MIN 4 SM 5 2 SM 1 MIN 8 2 4 2

Next, we calculate the value inside the MIN operations: 

- MIN 4 2 6 = 2
- MIN 8 2 4 = 2

So the expression becomes:

MIN 4 MIN MAX 8 8 2 MAX 3 4 2 8 MIN 2 MIN 4 SM 5 2 SM 1 2 2

Next, we calculate the value inside the SM operations: 

- SM 5 2 = 5 + 2 = 7
- SM 1 2 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

Now, we have:

MIN 4 MIN MAX 8 8 2 MAX 3 4 2 8 MIN 2 MIN 4 7 5

And then inside the MAX operations: 

- MAX 8 8 2 = 8
- MAX 3 4 2 8 = 8

And the expression simplifies to 

MIN 4 MIN 8 8 MIN 2 MIN 4 7 5

And then inside the MIN operations: 

- MIN 4 7 5 = 4
- MIN 2 4 = 2

So it simplifies down to

MIN 5 0 2 = Minimum of (5,0,2) = 0

MAX 6 5 3 = Maximum of (6,5,3) = 6
MAX 1 4 1 = Maximum of (1,4,1) = 4

Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:
[MAX [MIN 1 7] 2 [MAX 0 1 5]] [SM 1 4 [MIN 1 6 4]] 3

Solving for the next two MIN and MAX we get:
MIN 1 7 = Minimum of (1,7) = 1
MAX 0 1 5 = Maximum of (0,1,5) = 5

Substitute these values back into the expression:
[MAX 1 2 5] [SM 1 4 [MIN 1 6 4]] 3

Now resolve the MIN again:
MIN 1 6 4 = Minimum of (1,6,4) = 1

Substitute this back into the expression:
[MAX 1 2 5] [SM 1 4 1] 3

Now we will resolve the MAX and SM:

SM 1 4 1 = Sum of (1,4,1) modulo 10 = (1+4+1) mod 10 = 6 mod 10 = 6

Lastly, substitute these back into the expression:

[MAX 9 7 8] = max(9,7,8) = 9

[MAX 7 0 3] = max(7,0,3) = 7

[MAX 7 2 8] = max(7,2,8) = 8

[MIN 1 [MAX 6 2 0] [MIN 7 8 7]] = MIN 1 [MAX 6 2 0] 7 = MIN 1 7 7 = 1 

Replace these values in the expression: 

[MIN [MAX 3 5 9] [SM [SM 4 2 7] 8 [MAX 2 1 0]] 8] 9 [MAX 0 1 9]. 

Solve the remaining MAX operator:

Replace this value in the expression: 

[MIN 9 [SM [SM 4 2 7] 8 [MAX 2 1 0]] 8] 9 [MAX 0 1 9]. 

Now, we move onto the SM (sum modulo 10) operator. 

[SM 4 2 7] =  (4 + 2 + 7) mod 10 = 3 

Replace this value in the expression: 

[MIN 9 [SM 3 8 [MAX 2 1 0]] 8] 9 [MAX 0 1 9]. 

Solve the remaining MAX operator: 

[MAX 2 1 0] = 2 

Replace this value in the expression:

[SM 7 [MAX 5 5 6]] -> [SM 7 6] =  (7+6) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3

This gives us: [MIN 5 3 [MIN 9 1 8] [MAX [SM 9 5 7] [MAX 2 5 8] 0]]

Then:

[MIN 9 1 8] -> 1

Giving: [MIN 5 3 1 [MAX [SM 9 5 7] [MAX 2 5 8] 0]]

Next:

[SM 9 5 7] -> (9+5+7) mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1

Resulting in: [MIN 5 3 1 [MAX 1 [MAX 2 5 8] 0]]

Leaving us with: [MIN 5 3 1 [MAX 1 8 0]]

Then:

[MAX 1 8 0] -> 8

Giving us finally: [MIN 5 3 1 8]

Now we go to the right part of the expression and evaluate the inner parts:

First, calculate the SM, MAX and MIN operations:

- MAX 0 9 4 gives 9
- SM 4 9 1 gives 4 (because sum modulo 10 is 14 mod 10, which is 4)
- MAX 0 4 3 gives 4
- SM 2 7 5 gives 4 (because 14 mod 10 is 4)
- SM 5 5 2 gives 2 (because 12 mod 10 is 2)
- MAX 1 8 1 gives 8
- MIN 7 1 0 gives 0
- SM 9 2 4 gives 5 (because 15 mod 10 is 5)

So the expression can be simplified as:

[SM [MAX 9 4 2] [MAX 4 5 4 2] [MIN 0 2 8] 3 [MIN 2 0 5] 2]

Continue to calculate the MAX and MIN operations:

- MIN 0 2 8 gives 0
- MIN 2 0 5 gives 0

7. [MIN 5 3 8] equals minimum of 5, 3, and 8, which is 3
8. [MIN 0 5 3] equals minimum of 0, 5, and 3, which is 0

Substitute these results back to our expression:

[SM [SM [SM 7 4 9] 0 [MIN 4 9 5]] 8 [MIN 5 [SM 4 9 2] 3]]

9. [SM 7 4 9] equals (7 + 4 + 9) % 10 = 20 % 10 = 0

The MAX of [4 6 0] is 6.
The SM of [8 1 3] is 2 (because 8+1+3=12 and the sum modulo 10 is 2).
The operation now becomes:

And [MAX 4 5 0] gives 5. 

Similarly,
[MIN 4 2 9] gives 2, and
[MIN 4 7 9] gives 4. 

Also,
[SM 6 3 4] gives 3 (because 6+3+4=13 and the sum modulo 10 is 3),
[MAX 6 9 7] gives 9. 

Update the equation further:
[SM 5 [SM [SM 9 6 2] [SM 5 5 4] 9] [MAX 5 [MIN 2 1 4] [MAX 3 4 9]]]

Now, coming to [SM 9 6 2]: 9 + 6 + 2 = 17, so the SM is 7 as modulo 10 of 17 is 7. 
[SM 5 5 4] gives 4.

Similarly, 
next [MIN 2 1 4] gives 1, 
and [MAX 3 4 9] gives 9.

[MIN 1 9 2] produces 1
[SM 4 6 8] gives (4+6+8) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8
[SM 5 8 4] gives (5+8+4) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7
[MIN 6 0 6] produces 0
[MAX 2 2 8] produces 8
[SM 8 5 9] gives (8+5+9) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2
[MIN 5 5 1] produces 1
[SM 0 5 5] gives (0+5+5) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0

Now, with these results, we can replace these operators in our original expression:

[MIN 4 [SM 3 [SM 7 1 8] [MAX 7 7 0]] [MIN [MIN 1 8 0] [SM 9 8 2] 9]]

[SM 7 1 8] gives (7+1+8) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6
[MAX 7 7 0] produces 7
[MIN 1 8 0] produces 0

Now, doing next level of calculation:

[SM 3 6 7] gives (3+6+7) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6
[MIN 0 9 9] produces 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, solve the internal brackets in the expression. 

We have two ""MIN"" functions in the first part of ""SM"", which are [MIN 4 7 6] and [MIN 6 1 0]. Here the minimum number is 4 in the first MIN and 0 in the second MIN.
So, the expression becomes,
[SM 4 [SM 4 0 9] [MIN [SM 3 5 7] 0 [MAX 3 2 0]]]

Next we have a ""SM"" function within a ""SM"" function, [SM 4 0 9]. If we add these numbers and consider modulo 10, we get 3. 
So, the expression now changes to,
[SM 4 3 [MIN [SM 3 5 7] 0 [MAX 3 2 0]]]

Now we have two more ""MIN"" and ""MAX"" functions in the first part of the expression. These are [SM 3 5 7], [MAX 3 2 0]. The sum modulo 10 equals 5 and the maximum number is 3.
The expression becomes,
[SM 4 3 [MIN 5 0 3]]

The minimum number in [MIN 5 0 3] is 0, 
therefore, the final expression for the first part of ""SM"" is 
[SM 4 3 0] = 7

Now, focus on the second part of the expression,

We have ""MIN"" and ""MAX"" functions, which are [MAX 8 8 7] and [MAX 9 9 2]. The maximum numbers are 8 and 9.
So, the new expression becomes,
[SM 9 [MIN 8 4 9] [MAX 8 [SM 7 1 2] [MAX 6 4 6]]]

Now solve [MIN 8 4 9], which gets minimum number 4. So expression becomes,
[SM 9 4 [MAX 8 [SM 7 1 2] [MAX 6 4 6]]]

In the remaining expression, we have ""SM"" and ""MAX"" functions, which are [SM 7 1 2] and [MAX 6 4 6]. The sum modulo 10 is 0 and the maximum number is 6.
So, the expression becomes,
[SM 9 4 [MAX 8 0 6]]
The maximum number in [MAX 8 0 6] is 8, 
hence, the final expression for the second part is [SM 9 4 8] = 1

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the innermost nested expressions.

- MIN operation: [MIN 0 6 5] = 0

- SM operation: [SM 5 5 5] = 15 but we use Sum Mod 10 so the output is 5.

- MAX operation: [MAX 1 5 9] = 9

- MAX operation: [MAX 6 9 4] = 9

- SM operation: [SM 9 3 9] = 21 but we use Sum Mod 10 so the output is 1.

- MAX operation: [MAX 2 7 0] = 7

- SM operation: [SM 9 6 0] = 15 but we use Sum Mod 10 so the output is 5.

- SM operation: [SM 9 9 1] = 19 but we use Sum Mod 10 so the output is 9.

So, the expression now simplifies to:

[MAX 0 [SM [MAX 0 8 5] [MAX 9 7 9] 1] [SM [MIN 1 5 7] 2 [MAX 5 9 6]]]

We now find the results of the next layer of operators.

- MAX operation: [MAX 0 8 5] = 8

- MAX operation: [MAX 9 7 9] = 9

- MIN operation: [MIN 1 5 7] = 1

- MAX operation: [MAX 5 9 6] = 9

Now, our expression is:

[MAX 0 [SM 8 9 1] [SM 1 2 9]]

Again, let's calculate the new expressions.

- SM operation: [SM 8 9 1] = 18 but we use Sum Mod 10 so the output is 8.

- SM operation: [SM 1 2 9] = 12 but we use Sum Mod 10 so the output is 2.

Now, it becomes:

[MAX 0 8 2]

Finally, we apply the MAX operator to arrive at the answer:

- MAX operation: [MAX 0 8 2] = 8.

So, the final output is 8.",8,8

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we'll find the results of the operations inside the brackets:

- SM 9 4 0 is (9+4+0) modulo 10 = 13 modulo 10 = 3
- MAX 6 4 3 is 6
- MIN turns into [MIN 3 6 3] which results in 3

Next, we can simplify further:

- SM 3 4 4 is (3+4+4) modulo 10 = 11 modulo 10 = 1
- MAX 4 7 1 is 7
- MIN turns into [MIN 1 7 3] which results in 1.

Now, we can simplify to the next layer:

- MAX 1 0 4 is 4
- MIN 7 4 9 is 4
- SM turns into [SM 4 4 6] which results in (4+4+6) modulo 10 = 14 modulo 10 = 4

- MAX 6 4 5 is 6
- MAX turns into [MAX 4 6 2] which results in 6

Finally, we can simplify to the final layer:

- [MAX 1 1 0] = max(1, 1, 0) = 1

[MAX 2 8 0] = 8

Solve the SM operators first:

- MAX 1 0 7 = 7

Evaluating this expression further:

- SM 9 9 3 = 1
