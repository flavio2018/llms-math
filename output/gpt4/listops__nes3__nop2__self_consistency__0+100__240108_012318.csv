A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, you can resolve the deepest nested expressions by finding the sum and minimum or maximum where necessary. 

SM 3 1 equals 4 but the SM operator means this should be represented modulo 10 so it still equals 4. 

The minimum of 5 and 9 is 5.

The maximum of 1 and 8 is 8.

The maximum of 3 and 3 is 3.

[SM 9 3] is 2, because 9 + 3 = 12, and again 12 modulo 10 is 2.

So our expression becomes [SM [MIN 1 4] [SM 2 2]].

[SM 5 0] is the sum of 5 and 0, modulo 10. This gives us 5.

[MIN 3 5] takes the minimum of 3 and 5, which gives us 3.

So we can simplify the expression to:
