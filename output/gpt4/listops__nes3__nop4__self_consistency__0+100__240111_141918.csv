[MAX 5 9 2 5] means we should find the maximum number in the list [5,9,2,5]. The maximum number is 9, so we replace [MAX 5 9 2 5] with 9. 

[MAX 5 0 9 7] means we should find the maximum number in the list [5,0,9,7]. The maximum number is 9, so we replace [MAX 5 0 9 7] with 9. 

[MIN 7 1 6 2] means we should find the minimum number in the list [7,1,6,2]. The minimum number is 1, so we replace [MIN 7 1 6 2] with 1. 

Now our expression looks like this:
[MAX 9 [SM 9 3 9 9] [SM [SM 3 7 0 9] 8 1 4] 7].

Then, we look at the remaining SM operations:

[SM 9 3 9 9] means we should find the sum of numbers in the list [9,3,9,9] modulo 10. The sum is 30 and when we take this mod 10 we get 0, so we replace [SM 9 3 9 9] with 0. 

[SM 3 7 0 9] means we should find the sum of numbers in the list [3,7,0,9] modulo 10. The sum is 19 and when we take this mod 10 we get 9, so we replace [SM 3 7 0 9] with 9. 

Now our expression looks like this:
[MAX 9 0 [SM 9 8 1 4] 7].

Again, we have a remaining SM operation:

[SM 9 8 1 4] means we should find the sum of numbers in the list [9,8,1,4] modulo 10. The sum is 22 and when we take this mod 10 we get 2, so we replace [SM 9 8 1 4] with 2. 

Now our expression looks like this:
[MAX 9 0 2 7].

In the same way, for the other sub-task:

MAX(3,3,9,6) = 9
MAX(4,2,3,6) = 6

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve the smallest expressions inside brackets. Let's start with the SM (sum modulo) and MAX expressions. We have:

- SM 6 5 2 6 = (6+5+2+6) mod 10 = 19 mod10 = 9.

- MAX 4 7 5 6 = The greatest number in this list is 7.

- MIN 2 1 3 7 = The smallest number in this list is 1.

Replacing these values in the original string, we get:

Now, we perform the MAX operation. [MAX 6 9 9 1] = 9, which gives us:

[MIN 1 9 [SM 7 6 1]] 7]

Next, process the remaining SM operation. SM 7 6 1 = (7+6+1) mod 10 = 14 mod10 = 4, so we then have:

Similarly, in [MAX 7 1 4 2], it finds the maximum number, which is 7.

For [MIN 2 7 5 9] & [MIN 3 9 1 4], it finds the minimum number, which is 2 & 1 respectively.

[SM 6 3 5 2] =  (6 + 3 + 5 + 2) % 10 = 16 % 10 = 6

[SM 3 7 1 5] = (3 + 7 + 1 + 5) % 10 = 16 % 10 = 6

The two nested MAX operations can be solved as follows:
[MAX 4 4 6 3] = 6
[MAX 2 5 6 5] = 6

Similarly, the MIN operation becomes:
[MIN 1 1 9 3] = 1

The SM operation should be calculated as (the sum of numbers) modulo 10:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should calculate inside of the square brackets, then outside.
Here is our initial expression:
[MAX [MAX 6 4 [SM 2 1 9 0] [SM 9 9 0 6]] 4 [SM [MIN 4 1 1 0] 4 [MIN 9 3 0 6] 5] 7]

1. [SM 2 1 9 0] would be sum of these numbers modulo 10, which equals (2+1+9+0)%10 = 12 % 10 = 2.
2. [SM 9 9 0 6] would be sum of these numbers modulo 10, which equals (9+9+0+6)%10 = 24 % 10 = 4.

So, our expression becomes:
[MAX [MAX 6 4 2 4] 4 [SM [MIN 4 1 1 0] 4 [MIN 9 3 0 6] 5] 7]

Continuing with the square brackets:

3. [MAX 6 4 2 4] reveals maximum number in list, which is 6.
4. [MIN 4 1 1 0] reveals minimum number in list, which is 0.
5. [MIN 9 3 0 6] reveals minimum number in list, which is 0.

So, our expression becomes:
[MAX 6 4 [SM 0 4 0 5] 7]

Continue to reduce:

6. [SM 0 4 0 5] would be sum of these numbers modulo 10 = (0+4+0+5)%10 = 9 % 10 = 9.

Finally, we have: [MAX 6 4 9 7] 

And maximum of these numbers is 9.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, calculate the SM parts:
[SM 8 6 6 6] = (8+6+6+6) mod 10 = 26 mod 10 = 6.
[SM 3 6 [MAX 7 2 5 5] [SM 1 0 3 8]] = [SM 3 6 7 (1+0+3+8 mod 10)] = [SM 3 6 7 2] = (3+6+7+2) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8.

Now replace these in the larger expression and move on to the MAX parts:
[MIN [MIN 5 6 [MAX 7 7 5 7] 5] 8 1 8]
which simplifies to
[MIN [MIN 5 6 7 5] 8 1 8]
We notice that,
[MAX 7 7 5 7] = maximum of 7, 7, 5, 7 = 7.

Then we calculate the MIN parts:
[MIN 5 6 7 5] = minimum of 5, 6, 7, 5 = 5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we calculate the SEMANTIC OPERATIONS.

[SM 5 6 5 7] means we add all the numbers and then take modulo 10. So, (5 + 6 + 5 + 7) = 23, and 23 mod 10 is 3.

Similarly, [SM 8 4 3 0] equals (8 + 4 + 3 + 0) = 15, and 15 mod 10 is 5.

[SM 5 1 0 6] equals (5 + 1 + 0 + 6) = 12, and 12 mod 10 is 2.

[SM 3 4 6 7] equals (3 + 4 + 6 + 7) = 20, and 20 mod 10 is 0.

After, we get
[SM 4 [MAX 3 5 9 3] [MAX 9 2 0 8] 5].

Second, we calculate the MAX OPERATIONS.

[MAX 3 5 9 3] means we have to find the maximum value among them, which is 9.

Similarly, [MAX 9 2 0 8] return the maximum value which is 9.

After, we get
[SM 4 9 9 5].

For [SM 8 9 3 4], summing all the numbers gives 24, modulo 10 results in 4.

For [SM 4 0 9 7], summing all the numbers gives 20, modulo 10 results in 0.

For [MAX 9 0 4 3], the largest number is 9. 

Substitute those results back into the equation:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, find the sums:
SM 5 3 8 8 equals (5+3+8+8) mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4
SM 5 7 8 2 equals (5+7+8+2) mod 10 = 22 mod 10 = 2

Then we substitute these values back into the expression and calculate max and min:
MAX 3 4 4 2 is 4 because 4 is the highest number among the values we compare.
MIN 2 6 2 9 is 2 because 2 is the lowest number among the values we compare.
MAX 5 8 0 0 is 8 because 8 is the highest number among the values we compare.

Substitute these values back into the expression:
MIN 1 4 2 [MIN 2 3 5 8] 1 simplifies as:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the values inside square brackets. 

1. [MIN 7 9 2 7] = 2 (it's the smallest number among the numbers inside the brackets).
2. [MAX 3 0 9 4] = 9 (it's the largest number among the numbers inside the brackets).
3. [MAX 5 [MAX 1 3 1 2] 1 [MIN 8 9 0 1]] becomes [MAX 5 3 1 0] (replacing MAX with maximum number among 1,3,1,2 - 3 and MIN with smallest number among 8,9,0,1 - 0)

Now replace these values in the original statement.
The equation now is [MAX 2 [SM 8 2 0 9] 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, solve for the MAX operators: 
   So, [MAX 9 2 5 9] = 9 
   And, [MAX 3 0 7 5] = 7 
   And, [MAX 7 9 9 9] = 9 
   And, [MAX 5 6 1 5] = 6 
   
   Now, replace these values in the expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can solve the expressions with the ""MAX"" operator. 
""MAX 9 2 4 6"" = 9 (because 9 is the highest number among 9, 2, 4 and 6)
""MAX 8 2 4 0"" = 8  (because 8 is the highest number among 8, 2, 4 and 0)

Then the expression becomes:
[SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] [MIN 8 9 1 6]]]

Next, let's solve the expression with the ""MIN"" operator.

""SM 2 7 8 1"" = (2+7+8+1) % 10 = 18 % 10 = 8

""SM 9 8 1 8"" = (9+8+1+8) % 10 = 26 % 10 = 6

The expression becomes:

[SM 6 9 3 8] gives the sum of the values 6, 9, 3 and 8 modulo 10 which is 6.

[MAX 0 4 0] gives the maximum of the numbers 0, 4, and 0, it is 4

So the expression becomes:

[SM 6 6 7] gives the sum of the values 6, 6 and 7 modulo 10 which is 9.

[MAX 0 4 4] gives the maximum of the values 0, 4 and 4, it's 4

[MIN 0 7 5 0] = 0
[SM 3 1 1 4] = (3 + 1 + 1 + 4) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9

Replacing these results in the original expression, we get:

- [MIN 9 3 4 4] = 3 (as 3 is the smallest number)
- [MAX 8 4 4 7] = 8 (as 8 is the largest number)

Now we substitute these results back into the original expression:

- [SM 3 1 8 8] = (3+1+8+8) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0 (as the sum 20 falls out of the range of single-digit numbers, we take the remainder of 20 divided by 10)
