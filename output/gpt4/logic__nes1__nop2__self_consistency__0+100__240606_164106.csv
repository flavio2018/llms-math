0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Anything OR True will always be True, plugging in both truth and false values to validate;
If h is T, then T OR T gives T.
If h is F, then F OR T gives T.
So, (h|T) always simplifies to T.",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical ""or"" operator |, will return True if at least one of the operands is True. Since in your expression (F|T), T (True) is one of the operands, then the result of the expression will be True (T). So, the simplified logic formula is T.",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression ""(v&T)"" is simply saying ""v AND True"". The logical AND operator takes two boolean expressions and evaluates to True if and only if both of its operands are True.

Here, since one of the operands is already True (T), the result of the AND operation will always be the value of the other operand. Hence, the entire expression simplifies to:

v",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic operation OR ""|"" returns True if at least one of its operands is True. In this case, one of the operands is False (F), but the other one is ""o"", which can be either True or False. So, if ""o"" is True, the result would be True, and if ""o"" is False, the result would be False. So, regardless of the OR operation, the output in this case is just as the value of ""o"". 

Therefore, the simplified form of the given logic formula is just ""o"".",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The or operation can be represented as follows:

- If either of the arguments is true, then the result is true.
- If both arguments are false, then the result is false.

So if we have (q|F), it means either q is true or false is true. Since we know that false is always false, the result of this operation really just depends on the value of q.

Therefore, we can simplify this expression to 'q'.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula is (f&F). The '&' operator means 'and'. If one of the values in an 'and' operation is False (F), the result is automatically False no matter what the other value is. Therefore, the simplified version of the formula is just False (F).",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","w&w equals w. Because if w is true then w&w is also true, but if w is false then w&w is also false. So, the statement can simplified to just 'w'.",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical OR operation (represented by '|') returns True if at least one of its operands is True. So when we perform (b|F), this simply means 'b OR False'. Since False has no effect in a 'OR' operation, the simplified version of the given logic formula is just 'b'.",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In logical OR operation, if any of the inputs is true, then the output is true. Given that both inputs are the same 'o', the result would be 'o' regardless of whether 'o' is true or false. So, the simplification of the formula is 'o'.",o,o
