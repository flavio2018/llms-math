A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, calculate the SM 1 0 4 7. Sum them all: 1 + 0 + 4 + 7 = 12.
2. However, the SM operator takes the sum modulo 10, so 12 modulo 10 = 2. Thus, [SM 1 0 4 7] = 2.
3. Now, calculate the result of [SM 3 2 0 [MIN 9 4 4 9]]. Here, we have another operator MIN. The MIN operator takes the least value from the list, which is 4. Replace [MIN 9 4 4 9] with 4.
4. The expression now is [SM 3 2 0 4]. Sum all elements: 3 + 2 + 0 + 4 = 9 (mod 10).
5. Thus, [SM 3 [SM 1 0 4 7] 0 [MIN 9 4 4 9]] = 9.
6. Now process [SM [MIN 8 7 9 8] [MAX 6 4 4 1] 4 8]. First calculate the MIN and MAX values: MIN of 8, 7, 9, 8 is 7 and MAX of 6, 4, 4, 1 is 6.
7. Now, the expression is [SM 7 6 4 8]. Add the numbers: 7 + 6 + 4 + 8 = 25. As per the SM operator, take modulo 10 of the sum i.e., 25 mod 10 = 5. Thus, [SM [MIN 8 7 9 8] [MAX 6 4 4 1] 4 8] = 5.

For SM 6 5 2 7, we need to sum the numbers: 6+5+2+7=20 and then take modulo 10 so SM 6 5 2 7=0.
For MIN 8 6 8 4, we find the minimum among the numbers, so MIN 8 6 8 4=4.

Then we have [SM 9 [MAX 9 0 1] [SM 8 1 5 6]] [SM [MAX 3 3 9 6] 9 6 4] 7. 

Let's solve the [MAX 9 0 1] and [Max 3 3 9 6] parts. The maximum of [9 0 1] is 9 and the maximum of [3 3 9 6] is 9.

The second expression is [SM 4 7 1 4] which equals 4 + 7 + 1 + 4 = 16. As SM is a modulo 10 operation, so 16 is equivalent to 6 in SM. 

So, the MIN expression [MIN 6 [MAX 7 5 4 5] [SM 4 7 1 4] 1] becomes [MIN 6 7 6 1]. The minimum number amongst these is 1.

The next expression is [SM [MAX 0 0 3 9] 6 [SM 3 2 7 6] 9]. Inside this, the term [MAX 0 0 3 9] values to a maximum of 9.

The second term is [SM 3 2 7 6] which is equal to 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 18. However, considering the modulo 10 operation, it is equivalent to 8 in SM.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we'll evaluate the innermost operation.
[MIN 1 9 1 3] gives us the minimum number among 1, 9, 1 and 3, which is 1.
Similarly, [MIN 9 9 2 3] gives us 2.
[SM 3 4 6 6] gives the sum of these four numbers modulo 10, i.e. ((3+4+6+6) modulo 10) = 19 modulo 10 = 9.
[MAX 4 8 6 3] gives the maximum among 4, 8, 6, 3 which is 8.

Then the expression would look like:
[SM 2 1 [SM 3 1 2 6] [MAX 7 8 9 8]]:
Now, we evaluate the new inner list again:
[SM 3 1 2 6] gives ((3+1+2+6) modulo 10) = 12 modulo 10 = 2 and
[MAX 7 8 9 8] gives the maximum which is 9.

Then the expression will look something like:
[SM 2 1 2 9]

Which gives ((2+1+2+9) modulo 10) = 14 modulo 10 = 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First let's make clear what each operator means:
* MIN will select the smallest number of the list;
* MAX will select the highest number of the list;
* SM will sum all numbers of the list, if the result is over 10, then take the second digit.

Let's go one by one through the operators in our expression:

1. Inside the first MAX operator we have [MAX 2 4 9 2], which means we select the maximum value in this list: 9. 

2. Now we have 2 MAX operators left and 1 SM operator. Let's solve the SM operator [SM 8 9 3 4]. Summing these numbers we get 24, but this is more than 10, so we take the second digit, which is 4.

3. Now let's process the MAX operators where we previously had the nested MAX and SM operators. Now it's [MAX 4 9 4]. The maximum here is 9. 

4. After that we need to do the next SM operator in string, it's [SM 4 0 9 7], sum of these numbers is 20, so the result will be 0 (second digit).

5. Then we do the MAX operator in the same string [MAX 9 0 4 3], in this case maximum is 9. 

6. Then we the last SM operator in string [SM 1 0 9 2], when we sum it up, we get 12, so after applying modulo operator, we get 2 (second digit).

7. Now we can solve the first SM operator in our given string: [SM 4 9 8 2], when we sum them up, we get 23, and 3 is the second digit of 23, so the result is 3. 

So, the answer is 3.",3,3

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the SM parts. To do this, we find the sum of the numbers inside the brackets and take the last digit of the sum (modulo 10).
So, [SM 5 3 8 8] is (5 + 3 + 8 + 8) modulo 10 = 24 modulo 10 = 4.
And, [SM 5 7 8 2] is (5 + 7 + 8 + 2) modulo 10 = 22 modulo 10 = 2.

Now, substitute these values back into the original expression and solve for the other expressions.

The original expression becomes:
[MIN 1 [MAX 3 4 4 [MIN 2 6 2 9]] [MIN 2 3 5 [MAX 5 8 0 0]] 1]

Next, evaluate the MIN and MAX parts.
Starting with the MAX parts, [MAX 3 4 4 [MIN 2 6 2 9]] is the maximum of 3, 4, 4, and the minimum of 2, 6, 2, and 9.
The minimum of 2, 6, 2, and 9 is 2, so the MAX expression becomes [MAX 3 4 4 2], which is 4.

Also determine [MAX 5 8 0 0], which is the maximum of 5, 8, 0, and 0, which is 8.

Replace these in the expression:

[MIN 1 4 [MIN 2 3 5 8] 1]

Then calculate the remaining MIN expressions.
[MIN 2 3 5 8] is the minimum of 2, 3, 5, and 8, which is 2.
So the expression becomes:

[MIN 1 4 2 1]

Finally, calculate this last MIN portion.
[MIN 1 4 2 1] is the minimum of 1, 4, 2, and 1, which is 1.

MAX 5 3 1 0 = 5 (since 5 is the maximum number in this list)

Now, we replace those in the expression:

MAX 9 2 5 9 = 9
MAX 3 0 7 5 = 7
MAX 7 9 9 9 = 9
MAX 5 6 1 5 = 6

Now, our expression becomes: [SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1].

Next, [MIN 9 7 6 1] will return the minimum number among all the numbers, which is 1. So it becomes: [SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 1 1].

Then, solve [SM 4 9 6 7] which will return the sum of the numbers modulo 10, (4+9+6+7) mod 10 = 26 mod 10 = 6. So it turns to: [SM 6 4 1 1].

Finally, solve [SM 6 4 1 1] and it will again return the sum of the numbers modulo 10, (6+4+1+1) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2.
