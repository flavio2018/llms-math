A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify F&T as it will be always False (because False AND anything is False). Similarly, T&T&T is True (because True AND anything is True). So, now the logic statement looks like:

((i|(i|F))&(!(F|((T)&(!((!(!T))&(u|((j|j)&j)|(!F))))))).

Now, we can simplify j|j as j (because anything OR same thing is same thing) and !F as True (since NOT of False is True), and !T as F. So, the updated statement will be:

((i|(i|F))&(!(F|((T)&(!((F)&(u|(j&j)|T)))))).

Futher simplifying (i|F) as i (since anything OR false is the item itself)), (j&j) as j and (!F) as T:

(i&(!(F|(T&(!(F&(u|(j|T)))))).

Further simplifying (T & NOT F) as T (since True AND NOT False is True), and (u OR T) as T (since anything OR True is True):

(i&!(F|T)).

Finally, since (F OR T) is True, we have NOT TRUE as False:

(i&F).

And finally, anything AND FALSE is False. So, the simplified form of your logic statement is:

(((x&((x|(x&x))|x))&x)|(!(!(F&(!(((((c&c)|c)|c)|c)|((!((F&T)&T))|T))))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, within any statement (x&x), (x|x), or (c&c), or (c|c), they are redundancies, so they can be simplified to just x or c respectively:

(x&((x|(x&x))|x)) simplifies to (x&(x|x)) which further simplifies to (x&x) which is x.

Similarly, (((c&c)|c)|c)|c simplifies to c.

Secondly, 
1) F&T always equals to F, 
2) !(F&T) equals to !F which equals to T and 
3) ((F&T)&T) therefore equals to (F&T) which equals to F. 

So !((F&T)&T) simplifies to !F which is T. 

Then (!((F&T)&T))|T simplifies to T|T which is T. 

Hence:
!(!(F&(!(((((c&c)|c)|c)|c)|((!((F&T)&T))|T)))) simplifies to !(!(F&(!c|T))) 

As F&(!c|T) equals to (F&!c)|(F&T), and (F&!c)|(F&T) equals to F&!c (since F&T as discussed earlier equals to F), the above further simplifies to !(!F&!c) which equals to !!F | !!c

So: !(!(F&(!(((((c&c)|c)|c)|c)|((!((F&T)&T))|T))))) simplifies to F|c.

Lastly, whole formula (((x&((x|(x&x))|x))&x)|(!(!(F&(!(((((c&c)|c)|c)|c)|((!((F&T)&T))|T))))))

Second, note that anything OR ""True"" is certainly True, so we can eliminate ""t|T"" as T.

Next, !(T&(!(j&F))) simplifies to !(T&(!F)). Since not False is True, it becomes !(T&T) which is equivalent to F.

The expression (!(!(!(!(F&F))))) simplifies to !(!!F) which equates to !F. Since not False is True, this simplifies to T.

This leaves us with the expression (T&(T&(T&((T&F) | F)))). 

Let's further simplify this expression - 
This simplifies to (T&(T&(T&(F | F)))).
Since F | F is false and anything AND ""False"" is False use these rules to simplify the expression further to (T&(T&(T&F))) which simplifies to (T&(T&F)) which simplifies to (T&F) which finally simplifies to False (F).

Therefore, the formula simplifies to:
(z&(F|F|F))|(T&T&(!w|!s|T))

Next, we understand ""F|F|F"" as ""F"" (False or False or False -> False) and ""T&T"" as ""T"" (True And True -> True). So, the formula obtains a simpler form:

(z&F)|(T&(!w|!s|T))

At this point, we also know that ""z&F"" would be False and ""T&(!w|!s|T)"" would be True.

1. In the clause (T & F), the result of ""True AND False"" is always False, therefore, it can simplify to F. Hence, the clause becomes (((f|(((f|f)&(f|f))&f))|T)&((T&(!(!F)))&T))

2. In this simplified clause, |T means that anything OR True is True, so it simplifies to T. Hence, the clause becomes ((T&(!(!F)))&T).

3. In (!(!F)), double negation of False is False. Therefore, the clause becomes ((T & F) & T), which can be simplified to F (because T & F = F).

4. For outer clause (t&F), any value AND False is False. Hence, it simplifies to F.

5. For the external formula, we have (F | T), False OR anything is always anything. This simplifies to T.

6. Also, the clause (t | (!T)), is t | F because the negation (!T) of True (T) is False (F), and this further simplifies to t because anything OR False is the literal itself.

1. (g&T) = g because anything AND true is itself.
2. (g&g) = g, repeating AND operation on the same value is pointless.
3. (g|F) = g, because anything OR false is itself.

Since !F is always true, ((T|((!F)&((((x|(x&(T|(!F))))&x)|F)|(T&(F|((F|(!(c&F)))|T))))))
can be simplified to:

((T|((T)&((((x|(x&(T|(T))))&x)|F)|(T&(F|((F|(!(c&F)))|T))))))

The operation with T results in true, and x &(T) = x. The expression:

((T|((T)&((((x|(x&(T|(T))))&x)|F)|(T&(F|((F|(!(c&F)))|T))))))

then becomes:

which is:

((T|((T)&((x&x)|F)|(T&(F|((F|(!c))|T))))))

And x&x equals x. So the expression:

((T|((T)&((x&x)|F)|(T&(F|((F|(!c))|T))))))

Becomes:

((T|(T&x|F)|(T&(F|((F|(!c))|T)))))

Now, F|((F|(!c))|T) = F|(!c|T) = F|T = T, and the simplification results in:

((T|(T&x|F)|(T&T))

Now, T&x = x, and T&T = T. So the new expression is:

(T|x|F|T).

   - Since ""F"" represents False and its logical operation, 

     - d|F - This can be simplified to ""d"". Any value OR False is simply that value itself.

     - (F&F) - This can be simplified immediately to ""F"". Anything AND False is False.

     - e|(F&F) - Since (F&F) is ""F"", the expression becomes e|F and further simplified to ""e"".

     - (((e&e)&F) - The expression ((e&e) is simply ""e"". And then (e&F) is ""F"".  

     - (T&(((F&T)&T)&F)) - The expression becomes (T&((F&T)&F)), which further becomes (T&(F&F)), which further becomes (T&F), which can be simplified to ""F"".

     - (F|(T&F)) - The expression becomes (F|F), which can be simplified to ""F"".

     - Same simplification can be applied to the remaining elements.

2. Now, the original logical formula can be simplified to:

    (!((d&F)&F)|!(!F))

3. However, this again can be reduced further, because both (d&F) and (F&F) gives ""F"". So it becomes:

- F&(F&(F&(s|T))) simplifies to F because s|T is always True and the expression becomes F&F&F which equals F. 
- (F|T) | T | F simplifies to T because F|T is True and using this True with any OR operation gives True.

So,

So, (F&((((f|f)&(!F))|f)|F)) can be simplified to f.

(g|F) can also be simplified to g, and (g&F) is always False (since anything AND False is False), so T & (g & F) is also False.

Then, we have the & operation with the True value, the result will be the other value itself, so (f & T) can be simplified to f.

So, we get the intermediary result:

i|T always results to True because i OR True equals True. Similarly, f|T results to True, because f OR True equals True.

- ""Not True"" is ""False""

Using these rules, we can simplify step by step:

(!F) = True

(!F)|anything = True

(T&anything) = anything

(F&anything) = False

(F|F) = False

(T|T) = True

(!T) = False

So the expression becomes:
((True&(True|(z&(((True&False)|(!True))&True)))|False)|False)
=
(True|(z&((False|False)&True))
=
(True|z&False)

((((b&((r&((r&(!(F&T)))|F))|(T&(T&(!((b&F)|F))))))&(T|(!F)))|(b&T))|(b&b)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the inner expressions:
- (F&T) -> False, because the logical and operator requires both sides to be true.
- (!(F&T)) -> True, because we are negating a false.
- ((r&(!(F&T)))|F) -> (r|False), which simplifies to r, because the logical or operator requires only one side to be true and r can be either True or False.
- ((b&F)|F) -> (False|False), which simplifies to False. 
- (!((b&F)|F)) -> True, because we are negating a false.
- (T&(T&(!((b&F)|F)))) -> (T&T), which simplifies to True, because the logical and operator requires both sides to be true.

Let's substitute the simplified inner expressions back into our original formula:

((((b&r)|(True))&(T|(!F)))|(b&T))|(b&b).

Now we can simplify again:
- (T|(!F)) -> (T|True), which simplifies to True, because the logical or operator requires only one side to be true.
- (b&b) -> b, because it's logical and operator between the same literal.

So the formula now becomes:

((b|r)&True)|(b&T)|b. 

Finally, we simplify even further:
- ((b|r)&True) -> (b|r), because anything logically anded with True remains unchanged.
- (b&T) -> b, because anything logically anded with True remains unchanged.

So, the final simplified logic formula is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The values of T and F are constant and do not depend on the values of any variables so they simplify as follows:
- The formula ((T&(T&T))&F) simplifies to F because anything AND F is always F.
- The formula (F&(F|T)) simplifies to F because F AND anything is always F. 

Therefore we can substitute these two formulas into the original formula:

(((q&q)|q)&(((x&((x|(F|F))|F))|(x&(x|((F&T)&T))))&F)).

The formulas ((x|(F|F)) and ((F&T)&T)) simplify to x and F, respectively, as anything OR F is always that anything, and anything AND F is always F.

So, we rewrite the formula again:

(((q&q)|q)&(((x&(x|F))|(x&(x|F)))&F)).

Then you notice that anything AND F is always F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, simplify the expression that makes use of T and F values only:
- (T&(T&F)) is False as all values in an AND(&) operation should be true for outcome to be true, but here we have F which is false. 
- (F|(T|F)) equals True because, in OR (|) operation, if any one value is True then net with OR operation is True. Here, there is T=True in the statement.
- !(F|(F&((T|F)|T))) is True because logical NOT (!) converts F (false) into T (true). 
- (F|(j&(v&F))) is false because T or F = T only if all values in AND operation are true, the output will be true. But here we have F=false which makes the whole operation value false.
- Operands (T | false) where T is true and | is OR operation, will always result in True. 

So, the original complex statement simplifies to:
(l&((w&w)&True))&l)&(l | false)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, let's simplify the innermost expression. Any logic operation with False and True is easily calculable. 
   - (o&o)&F - Here AND operation with False gives us False. Therefore this expression results in F.
   - (a|F) - OR operation with False gives us the value of the other operand. Hence, this becomes just a. 
   - (F&T) - This gives False as AND operation with False results in False.
   - (!F) - It gives True as NOT operation with False results in True.

By substituting these values, we get : 
!(((o&o)&F)|(w|((!F)|(((j&((j|F)|j))|F)|(!(v&(l&(a&False)))))))).
Which simplifies to 
!((F)|(w|((T)|(((j&((j|F)|j))|F)|(!(v&(l&a))))))).

2. Further,
   - (j|F) - gives j as the result, 
   - (j|j) - gives j as the result,
   - (j|F) - gives j as the result,

Substitute these values:
!((F)|(w|((T)|(((j&j)|F)|(!(v&(l&a))))))).

Which simplifies to

!((F)|(w|((T)|((j|F)|(!(v&(l&a))))))).

3. Further,

   - (j|F) - gives j
   - (T|j) - OR operation with True results in True.
   - (T|(!(v&(l&a)))) - This also produces True irrespective of (!(v&(l&a))).

Substitute these values gives us:

2. Any value and'ed (&) with True (T) remains the value; any value and'ed (&) with False (F) becomes False (F). Thus, we can simplify (T&F) as F and (T&F) as F.

2. Rule: `F | X` and `X | F` always equate to X, whatever the value of X, and `F & X` and `X & F` always equate to False (F). Therefore, `(q|F)&F` simplifies down to `F & F` which equals `F`, irrespective of the value of q.

!T simplifies to F,
T&F simplifies to F.

!F simplifies to T

Let's apply these rules to the formula.
    
First, we can simplify ""c | (!T)"" to ""c | F"" (using rule 1), which further simplifies to ""c"" (using rule 4).

Second, ""F&T"" = F (using rule 3). Therefore, ""F&T | F"" equals ""F | F"", which simplifies to ""F"" (using rule 7).

Third, ""c | (c | c)"" simplifies to ""c | c"", which further simplifies to ""c"" (using rule 5 and again rule 5).

Now, substitute back into the formula, we get:

6. For any variable x, the expression (x & F) is always F. As such, (v & F) would be F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Reduction of duplicates and constants:
In the expression (v&v), the output will always be the same as the value of v itself, since we're taking the logical AND with the same value. This simplifies to v.
F | Y is always equivalent to Y for any Y, so we simplify (T|F) to T, and all the (X|F) to just X.
 
This gives us: !((v|((T|(!((a|(a&a))&F))|(p|((x&(F|F))|T))))|(d|T))).

2. Further simplification based on constants:
The expression (F|F) is always false, thus the expression(x & (F | F)) is false, since false AND anything is always false. 
Now, (X | T) where T represents True and X is any Boolean, is always True.

This simplifies our expression to: !((v|((T|((!(a|(a&a)))|T))|(d|T))).

3. The expression (a | (a & a)) is the same as (a | a) since (a & a) is just a. Hence, (a | a) simplifies to a.

This gives us: !((v|(T)|(d|T))).
