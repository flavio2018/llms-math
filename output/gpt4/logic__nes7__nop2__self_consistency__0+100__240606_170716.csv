A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, note that ""F"" stands for ""False"" and ""T"" stands for ""True"". 

We know that:

- value AND False is always False, (z & F equals to F).
- !False (not False) is always True.
- False OR any_value is always that_value (F | any_value equals to any_value).
- True OR any_value is always True (T | any_value equals to T).

Putting these together:
1. The expression (j & T) simplifies to j.
2. (z & F) simplifies to False, so (z&F)&(T&T) simplifies to F & T which further simplifies to False (F).
3. !F simplifies to True (T).

5. (((!F) | T) | (T | F)) simplifies to T or T, which further simplifies to True (T).
6. So the complex expression inside the main negation operator simplifies to (j | T), which always gives True regardless of the value of j.

Therefore, j&(j&T) or ((((!F)|T)|(T|((z&F)&(T&T))))|F) is always True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Simplify the inner layers of brackets first, taking note of some fundamental semantics of the symbols:
    - `!F` is equivalent to `T`, because `!` is a negation operator and `F` is False.
    - `anyValue | T` is equivalent to `T`, because the `|` operator represents a logical OR and `T` is True. If one of the values is True in a logical OR operation, the result is always True. 
    - `anyValue | F` is equivalent to `anyValue`, because if one of the values is False in a logical OR operation, the False is like a null so it doesn't affect the result - it'll be whatever the other value is.
    - `anyValue & F` is equivalent to `F`, because if one of the values is False in a logical AND operation, the result is always False. 

2. Apply these rules to the inner brackets:
    - `(F&F)` is `F` and `(w&F)` is `F`, so `((F&F)|(w&F))` simplifies to `(F | F)` which is `F`.
    - `!(e|(!F))` is `!(e|T)`, which is `!T` or `F`.
    - `T|(F|F)` simplifies to `T` because you're OR-ing something with True.
    - Instead of the original complex bracket and boolean mess, you can simplify to `((i|F)|(g|T))`.

3. Continuing with similar rules:
    - `(i|F)` simplifies to `i`.
    - `(g|T)` simplifies to `T`.

4. So, the overall expression simplifies to `(i|T)`, which is `T`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, observe that the expression ""!T"" is equivalent to ""F"", because logically not True is False. Similarly, ""!F"" is equivalent to ""T"", since logically not False is True.

Also, notice that for any value A (either True or False), ""A & T"" simplifies to ""A"" and ""A & F"" simplifies to ""F"". 

Finally, we have ""A | T"" simplifies to ""T"" and ""A | F"" simplifies to ""A"".

Applying these observations to the formula:

1. (!T)→F
2. (T | (F & (!(T & T)))) → (T | (F & (!T))) → (T | (F & F)) → (T | F) → T
3. (F | (((!T) | T) & F)) → (F | (T & F)) → (F | F) → F

- (T | F) is always True (T)
- (F | F) is always False (F), and !(F | F) is the negation of False which is True (T). But ((!(F|F))|T)|T) becomes True (T) since any value OR True gives True.
- (T & T) is True (T). But (T & T) & F is False (F) because True AND False gives False.

Now, the formula reads as:

- (m | T) would always be True (T) since any value or True is always True.

Next it will be:

- However, anything AND True gives that thing itself, so we get:

- Since anything AND itself gives itself, we have:

- Again, w|F would become w because of the OR operation with False, so:

      b&(!(!(w|(!T))&T)|T)

- The logical not of True is False, so we have:

      b&(!(!(w|F)&T)|T)

- Applying De Morgan's laws:

      b&(!(w&(!F)|(!T)&T)|T)

- But (!F) is True, and (!T) is False, and so we get:

- Simplifying, we get that (!False do not exists, (!True&True)) is False, that result in:

5. After substituting above derived values we have, (!(!((T|F)&(T&F)))). This simplifies to (!(!(T&F))), as ""true OR false"" gives true.

So, the expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify T | F, since if any value is true in this logical operation, then the result is certainly true. Also, T & F implies False, because in order for the 'and' operation to be true, both values have to be true. The negation of false (!F) is true.
So, the given logic formula simplifies to ((T|(T|F))|(i|(((b&T)|T)|((((k|F)|F)|T)&F)))). 

Then, we can simplify k | F and (b&T) | T, which results in k and T respectively because if any value is true, 'or' operation becomes true. Also since T&F = F, F&F also gives False.
So, the updated formula is ((T|(T|F))|(i|(((b&F)|T)|((((k|F)|F)|T)&F)))).

Next, the simplification of b&F and T&F results in F and F, respectively, because both values have to be true for the 'and' operation to be true.
So, the formula becomes ((T|(T|F))|(i|(((F)|T)|((((k|F)|F)|T)&F)))).

Then, any value or False will give that value itself, so (k|F) simplifies to k. 
So the formula becomes ((T|(T|F))|(i|(((F)|T)|(((k|F)|T)&F)))).

Also, any value or true will give true, so (F|T) simplifies to T. 
So the formula becomes ((T|(T|F))|(i|(T|((k|T)&F)))).

Again, any value or True reduces to True. Then, any value and False gives False itself.
