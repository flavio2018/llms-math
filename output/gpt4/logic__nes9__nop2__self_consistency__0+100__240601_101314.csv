A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, look at the logic constants T (True) and F (False). Here is the simple logic theory:

- T & F = F
- F & F = F
- T | T = T
- T | F = T
- F | F = F
- !T = F
- !F = T

- T & T = T
- !F = T
- F & F = F 
- T & F = F
So, replace all of them in the formula:

    - F, T&F, (!(!F))|T, (T|F)&F and ((T|F)&F) are equivalent to F.
   
2. Logical disjunction with T or negation of negation:
   - Any logical disjunction (denoted by '|') with T will always result in T. So
      - l|(n|(T&(!F))) is equivalent to l|(n|T) which simplifies to T.
      - !(!((T|F)&F)) is equivalent to !(!F) which is T.
   
3. Logical conjunction (denoted by '&') with F always results in F. So
   - (g&(l|(n|(T&(!F)))) is equivalent to g&F, which simplifies to F.
   - ((g&F)|(T&(!(!((T|F)&F))))) is equivalent to F|T, which is T.

3. Let's simplify further:

- (!(F)) is T because not False is True
- (F|T) is T because False or True is True
- ((F&(F|T)) simplifies to F because False and anything is False

2. Now, we can rewrite and simplify the expression considering these:

3. Next step:

- (T|T) simplifies to T because True or True is True
- ((k&(((k&T)|k)&T)) simplifies to k because anything and True remains the same
- ((!F)|k|T) simplifies to T because not False or anything is True

2. Any value ""or"" with False (A|F) is always A. So, (r|False) is r.
3. The logical not of True is False and vice versa (!T = F, !F = T). So, (!(!(T|T)) is T. 
4. Any value ""or"" with True (A|T) is always True. So, (T|F) and (T|c) is T.
5. Finally, any value ""and"" with False (A&F) is always False. So, you are left with r&F, which simplifies to False.

2. Using these rules, we can skip the step of solving the inner expression (((F|T)|F)&T) as it can be simplified directly to F. 

3. (!(F&(((F|T)|F)&T))) would therefore simplify to T, because !(F) = T.

4. Similarly, the expression !(p&F) is T, because !(F) = T.

5. So, (z|(z&(!(p&F)))) equates to (z|(z&T)) which further simplifies to z|z = z.

6. However, z&F = F. So, ((z|(z&(!(p&F))))&F) simplifies to F.

7. Hence, T&((!(F&(((F|T)|F)&T)))&((z|(z&(!(p&F))))&F)) boils down to T&F = F.

8. On the right side of the overall expression, (!T)|F is F.

    T & T = T,
    F & T = F,
    F | T = T,
    F & F = F,
    !F = T,
    !T = F.

Now, apply them in the formula.

Firstly, simplify the innermost terms. 
""(F|T)"" simplifies to T, cause whatever F's value, F or T when OR'ed with T results to T.
""(F&F)"" simplifies to F, cause whatever F's value, F when ANDed with F results in F.

Then, replace all simplified terms with their calculated values to get -  
((T&T)|((T&(T|(F&T)))&(!(g&(T&(T&F)))))) 

The next innermost simplifiable terms are ""(T | F)"" and ""(T & T)"" and ""(T&F)"".
These simplifies to T, T and F respectively.
Thus the simplified expression becomes -  
((T&T)|(T&T)&(!(g&(T&F))))

Next, ""(T & T)"" simplifies to T and !(T&F) simplifies to T.
Thus the simplified expression becomes -
(T | T)&!g

Finally ""T | T"" simplifies to T.
So, the expression boils down to -
T & !g 

Hence, the expression

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. `F&(!F)` will always be False because it means `False & Not False`, but `Not False` is True so that leaves us `False & True` which equates to False.

2. So, the equation simplifies to `((T|F)|((c&((T|(F|F))&T))|(T|(h&((!((F&F)|(F&F)))|F))|T)))`.

3. Continuing the simplification, `(F|F)` will always be False because it represents `False OR False` so it remains False.

4. So the equation simplifies to `((T|F)|((c&((T|F)&T))|(T|(h&((!(F|F))|F))|T)))`.

5. Looking into the inner parentheses again, we see `(F|F)` again, which we know simplifies to F.

6. So the equation simplifies to `((T|F)|((c&((T|F)&T))|(T|(h&(!F|F))|T)))`.

7. `!F` equates to `Not False` which is True, so the equation simplifies to `((T|F)|((c&((T|F)&T))|(T|(h&(T|F))|T)))`.

8. Now we know that `(T|F)` is True, because `True OR False` is always True. 

9. So the equation simplifies to `((T|F)|((c&True)|T))/(h&T|T))`.

10. Simplifying `c&True` to `c` and `h&T` to `h`, and realizing `T|T` to `T`, we get `(T|c|T)|(h|T)`.

Given the above, we can start simplifying:

1. (o&F) equals False, because anything ANDed with False is False.
2. (u&F) equals False, because anything ANDed with False is False.
3. (i&F) equals False, because anything ANDed with False is False.

7. (F|(!F)) equals True, because anything ORed with True is True.

Reducing this further:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can start simplifying from the innermost operations.

1. Since ""j & j"" is the same as ""j"", and ""j | j"" is also ""j"", the inner part simplifies to: 
   (((j)|j)&F), which in turn simplifies to ""F"" as ""j & F"" equals ""F"".

2. Furthermore, ""(!(!F))"" simplifies to ""T"", but ""T & F"" equals ""F"".

So the first part of the formula can be simplified to:

    (!F|(F|T))

which simplifies further to:

    !(F|T)

which is always False (as ""F OR T"" is always true, and then it gets negated by ""!"").

3. The second part of the original formula ""(!(T&(d|T)))"" simplifies to ""!!F"", which in turn simplifies to ""F"".

Combining the two parts, the entire formula simplifies to ""F & F"", which results in the value ""F"".",F,F

a) x & x is always equals to x, so ((x&x)&x)&x simplifies to x.
b) r | (r & T) is always equals to r, because (r & T) is r. Similarly, (d|d)&(d&d) simplifies to d and T&T simplifies to T.
c) So, y & ((r | T) | (d & T) | T) simplifies to y & T, which is just y.
d) Any logical formula OR'd with T (True) is always T. 
Using these rules we can simplify the original expression.

    F | F => F [logical OR operation]
    !F | T | i & F => T [logical NOT operation on F is T, hence OR operation with any value is T]

Next, we look at the operations involving only the variable 'a'. For any logic variable X:

    X | X = X [Redundancy law]
    X & X = X [Idempotence law]

Hence, a | a = a. Also, a & a = a. Thus, (a & (a | a) = a.

The formula thus far reduces to:
    (F | (a & T & a & F) & T)

Since, a & T = a [identity law], and a & F = F [annulment law]. Finally F | F = F [idempotence law], we get:

1. (T|F) is always true, as it means ""True or False."" Hence, replace (T|F) with T.

2. (T&T) is always true, as it means ""True and True."" Hence, replace (T&T) with T.

3. (g & g & g) is the same as g, because (g and g and g) will result in g if g is true, and will result in False otherwise. Hence, replace (g&(g&g)) with g.

Our simplified expression is now: !((T&(F|(g|T)))|(F&((k|(!(T&T)&(!T)))&T))).

Let's keep simplifying:

1. (F|(g|T)) is always true, because ""False or (anything)"" will result in (anything), and (anything or T) will always be true. Hence, replace (F|(g|T)) with T.

2. (!(T&T)&(!T)) is always false, because ((not True) and (anything)) will always be false. Hence, replace (!(T&T)&(!T)) with F.

Our simplified expression is now: !((T&T)|(F&((k&F)&T))).

Continuing the simplification:

1. (F&((k&F)&T)) is always false, because ""(False and (anything))"" will always be false. Hence, replace (F&((k&F)&T)) with F.

2. (T&T) is true. Hence, replace it with T.

5. (l & (m & T)) simplifies to (l & m) since anything AND-ed with T remains the same.

8. !(y & l & m) OR F simplifies to !(y & l & m), because anything OR-ed with F remains the same.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, simplify the innermost parentheses:
- !(h|(F|(F&T))) = !h as F or False and False will be False.
- T|(!T) = T because anything or True will always be True. 
- !T = F because negation of True is False.
- (T&(!(T|(!T)))) = (T&F) = F because True and False is always False.
- F|F = F because False or False is always False.

This gives us: ((q|q)&((T|T)|(!h|T)|(F&F))&(F|F))

Next, let's continue with the simplifications:
- q|q = q because anything or itself is itself.
- T|T = T because True or True will be always True.
- !h|T = T, because anything or True gives True.
- F&F = F because False and False is always false.

This gives us: (q&(T|T|T)&F)

Now continue:
- T|T|T = T
- q&T = q because anything and True is itself.
- q&F = F because anything and False is always false.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify some expressions in the given logic formula. 

1. (T&T) = T. Because when two True values get AND together, the result is True.
2. (F|T) = T. Because if any one of the logical OR values is True, then the result is True.
3. !T = F. The NOT of True is False.
4. (F|F) = F. Because if all the logical OR values are False, then the result is False.
5. (T|F) = T. Because if any one of the logical OR values is True, then the result is True.
6. (F&T) = F. Because if any one of the logical AND values is False, then the result is False.

After applying the above simplifications, the original logic formula becomes:

(k&T)|(((k&(k&T))|F)|F).

Next, consider the AND and OR simplifications:

1. (k&T) = k. Because True AND something gives something.
2. (F|F) = F. Because if all the logical OR values are False, then the result is False.
3. (k&(k&T)) = k. Because True AND something gives something.

After applying these simplifications, the logic formula becomes:

k|F. 

Then, consider the OR simplification:

2. 'T' OR something would be 'T', !l AND 'F' is 'F', 'T' AND 'F' would be 'F' and 'T' OR 'F' would result in 'T'. So, this also simplifies the formula to:

3. Now notice that the entire formula collapses to 'F', regardless of what 'a' is. Once we reach a result of 'F', no matter what values we OR it with, the result will always be 'F'. So, this entire formula simplifies to 'F'.

2. This means we can simplify the entirety of ((a&((a&F)))&!False) in (((a&a)|F)&(!False)) to ((a&a)|F)&(T) , which simplifies to (a|F)&T , which is a&T, since a or-ed with False is always a.

3. Substituting back into the main formula gives us ((a|a)&(T&(!F))).

4. Then, a or-ed with anything (let alone with itself) will always yield a, so ((a|a)&(T&(!F))) simplifies to (a&(T&(!F))).

5. Now, T & (!F) simplifies to T & T, which is simply T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, logical not ! reverses the value of a statement - so !T is F and !F is T.

Second, the logical and & returns T if and only if both statements are T. Meaning, any statement ANDed with F gives F and any statement ANDed with T gives the statement itself - because if one side of AND is F, whole result is F, and if one side of AND is T, whole result depends on the other side (as per AND logic operation).

Third, logical or | returns T if at least one statement is T. Meaning, any statement ORed with T gives T and any statement ORed with F gives the statement itself - because if one side of OR is T, whole result is T, and if one side of OR is F, whole result depends on the other side (as per OR logic operation).

So, let's simplify the given expression:

((((w&w)&((T&F)|((T&((F|F)|T))|((!((!T)|(F&F)))&F))))&(!F))&(T&F))

Here, w&w simplifies to w (using AND operation semantics). 

T&F results in F and F|F results in F. This means ((F|F)|T) is T and we get T&F in this statement, which gives us F again.

((!T)|(F&F)) is changed into (F|F) because !T is F and F&F is F. Then this operation results in F. (!F) changes into T. Then, F & T simplifies into F.

Also, T&F simplifies into F.

So, whole expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify each inner expression:

- (((p&p)|p) simplifies to p, since p&p is still p and p or p is still p.
- Note that T| anything (F or T) always simplifies to T and T&F = F.
- (T|((F|T)|(T&F))) simplifies to T.
- p&(T| anything) will always simplify to p, since anything OR True is always True.
- p OR p is still p and p AND p is still p.
- T&(k|(T|(T&T))) simplifies to T&k since T OR anything always simplifies to T, so T&T = T, hence you are only left with T&k.

So applying these rules, we get:

(!(p|p)|(T&k))

This further simplifies to:

(!(p)|(T&k))

The ""not"" operator flips the truth value, !p can be either true or false based on p's value, hence this cannot be further simplified. So, we obtain:

   So, our formula becomes ((f&F)|((!(F|((((g|F)&((F|T)&(T|T)))|g)&(F|(F|F)))))&F)).

2. Now, in the second part of the formula, ((((g|F)&((F|T)&(T|T)))|g), 
   any value ORed (using |) with True (T) would result in True, hence (F|T) and (T|T) both simplify to T. As well as (g|F) simplifies to True because g can be either True or False.

   So, we have (((T&T)|g), which simplifies to (T|g).

   Since any value ANDed with False gives False, and False ORed with any value gives that value itself, 

   We get the formula as ((f&F)|((!(F|T))&F)).

3. Still, in second part the NOT (using !) of False is True and the NOT of True is False, so !(F|T) simplifies to !T, which is F.

   So, the formula becomes ((f&F)|(F&F)).

4. By this point, the right side of the OR operation has simplified to False, because any value ANDed with False gives False.

   So, the formula becomes (f&F)|F, which simplifies to F|F.

At the end, we get that the full formula simplifies to F, or False.",F,f

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, any logical operation with False & False will always return False. So, we can substitute (F&F) with just False. 

So the expression becomes:
(((k&T)&k)&(k&((((w&w)&(((w|False)&(!False))|False)))|T)|(!(T&T)))).

And any logical operation where False is located at the OR side will not change the value of the original element. For example, A|False = A. Which means that the statement (w|False) is equal to w. And statement (!False) is equal to True. So, then we substitute these in the expression:

(((k&T)&k)&(k&((((w&w)&(w&True))|False)|T)|(!(T&T)))).

Also, any logical operation of type A&True will always return A. So, the operation (w&True) = w. Similarly, (T&T) = T. Let's substitute those operations as well:

(((k&T)&k)&(k&((((w&w)&w)|False)|T)|(!T))).

The negation of True (!T) is False, hence replace !T with False.

(((k&T)&k)&(k&((((w&w)&w)|False)|T)|False)).

Any logical operation where True is located at the OR side will always return True, regardless of the value of the other element. Hence, the statement ((((w&w)&w)|False)|T) = T. Then, replace that statement:

(((k&T)&k)&(k&T)&False).

Logical AND operator gets False value if at least one of variables is False. Then, simplifying the expression, we have:

False.

2. z OR False equals z (since anything OR-ed with False yields the original value), and we can simplify it to (((z&z)&T)&(z|(!((h|F)&((h&h)|F)))|T))|(z&T))).

3. z AND z is always z (since anything AND-ed with itself yields itself), so the formula simplifies to ((z&T)&(z|(!(h|F)&(h|F))|T))|(z&T).

4. h OR False is h (again, anything OR-ed with False yields the original value), and h AND h is h (since anything AND-ed with itself yields itself). Using those rules, we get the formula ((z&T)&(z|(!(h)&h)|T))|(z&T).

5. NOT h AND h is always false (since a value cannot be true and false at the same time). Thus we simplify down to ((z&T)&(z|F|T))|(z&T).

6. z OR False OR True is True (since anything OR-ed with True is always True), which leaves us with ((z&T)&T)|(z&T).

7. But z AND T is z (since a value AND-ed with True is always that value), so we finally get (z&z)|z.

(((w|(T&((q&q)|T)))&F)|(((!(!((w&F)|F)&F)))|T)|F))

Now we have that q&q = q and ((w&F)|F) simplifies to F, so we find:

(((w|(T&(q|T)))&F)|(((!(!F&F)))|T)|F))

Using ((w|(T&(q|T)))&F) we simplify to F and (!(!F&F)) simplifies to T, so we find:

Filling this value in,
(((T&((((d&F))|T)|T)|F))|F)|(((i&((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i))|i)|T))

Now, anything ANDed with False is False, so d&F simplifies to F.
Therefore, we have (((T&((F|T)|T)|F))|F)|(((i&((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i))|i)|T))

Anything ORed with True is True, so the following simplifications can be made:
* (F|T) simplifies to T
* (||T) simplifies to T
Therefore, we have ((((T&(T|T))|F)|F)|(((i&((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i))|i)|T))

Also anyting ANDed with True remains the same, so we simplify T&T as T.
(T&T) simplifies to T
i&i simplifies to i

Simplifying again, we get: ((T|F)|(((i&((q&T)|T))|i)|T))

Anything ORed with False remains the same, so T|F simplifies to T.
