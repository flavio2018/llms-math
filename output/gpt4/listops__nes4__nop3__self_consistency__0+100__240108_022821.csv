A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, we need to solve the innermost braces to eliminate the MIN, MAX and SM operators respectively.

We look for pairs of brackets and solve the operators in them:

MIN 3 6 0 = 0,
MIN 0 9 0 = 0,
SM 1 3 9 = 3,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the SM expressions:

SM 6 7 6 = (6 + 7 + 6) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
SM 7 3 1 = (7 + 3 + 1) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
SM 6 9 3 = (6 + 9 + 3) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8
SM [MAX 1 4 2] 6 [MAX 2 2 8] = SM 4 6 8 = (4 + 6 + 8) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

Substituting and simplifying the above, we get:

[SM [MIN 9 2 1] 8 [MIN 8 [MAX 0 4 6] 6]] [MAX 4 [MIN 6 [MAX 1 5 6] [MAX 9 4 1]] 8] 0

Next, calculate the MAX expressions:

MAX 0 4 6 = 6
MAX 1 5 6 = 6
MAX 9 4 1 = 9
MAX 2 2 8 = 8

Substituting these back in, our expression becomes:

[SM [MIN 9 2 1] 8 [MIN 8 6 6]] [MAX 4 [MIN 6 6 9] 8] 0

Next, calculate the MIN expressions:

MIN 9 2 1 = 1
MIN 8 6 6 = 6
MIN 6 6 9 = 6

Our expression now becomes:

[SM 1 8 6] [MAX 4 6 8] 0

Calculate SM and MAX:

SM 1 8 6 = (1 + 8 + 6) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5
MAX 4 6 8 = 8

[SM 0 2 7] -> This now becomes a sum of 0, 2 and 7, so we calculate 2 + 7 = 9.

[MAX 6 0 4] -> The maximum value is 6.

[MAX 9 6 8] -> The maximum value is 9.

For [MIN 7 3 7], it is the minimum among 7, 3, and 7 which is 3. For [MIN 9 4 6], it is also the minimum value among 9, 4, and 6 which is 4. Substitute these back into the bracket, we have [MIN [MAX 3 3 6] 0 [SM 9 3 4]]
 
[SM 9 3 4] would be the sum of 9, 3, and 4 modulo 10, which is 16 and 16 modulo 10 equals 6. Substitute this back into the big bracket we have [MIN [MAX 3 3 6] 0 6]

[MAX 3 3 6] is the maximum value among 3, 3 and 6, which is 6. Substitute it back into the big bracket we now have [MIN 6 0 6].

[MIN 8 5 8] produces the minimum among 8, 5, and 8. So the result is 5.

[MAX 7 [MAX 8 0 6] [MIN 5 5 6]] evaluates [MAX 8 0 6] to 8 and [MIN 5 5 6] to 5. Therefore, the full expression simplifies to [MAX 7 8 5], yielding result 8.

Thus, the first part which was [MAX 4 5 8] simplifies to [MAX 4 8], yielding result 8.

Now we can simpler the original expression:

Let's continue:

[MAX 1 5 [MAX 0 2 1]] = max(1,5,max(0,2,1)) = max(1,5,2) = 5
[MIN 6 8 0] = min(6,8,0) = 0
[SM 0 3 5] = (0 + 3 + 5) mod 10 = 8 mod 10 = 8
[MIN 2 3 6] = min(2,3,6) = 2
[MAX 7 8 0] = max(7,8,0) = 8
[MIN 2 3 0] = min(2,3,0) = 0

Now the expression is:

[SM [MAX 5 2 8] 6 [MIN [MAX 8 2 3] 9 0]]

And continue simplifying:

[MAX 5 2 8] = max(5,2,8) = 8
[MAX 8 2 3] = max(8,2,3) = 8

So now it is:

[SM 8 6 [MIN 8 9 0]]

[MIN 8 9 0] = min(8,9,0) = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, operate on the deepest operator. Start with the smallest unit of operation and then progress forward. 
Starting with the second deepest SM operator - [SM 6 4 8] :
SM or sum modulo 10 = (6+4+8) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8 

SM [SM 2 [SM 6 4 8] [MAX 1 1 1]] then becomes:
SM [SM 2 8 [MAX 1 1 1]]

Now moving on to the second deepest MAX operator - [MAX 1 1 1] :
MAX = maximum of 1, 1, 1 = 1

SM [SM 2 8 [MAX 1 1 1]] then becomes:
SM [SM 2 8 1] 

Calculate SM 2 8 1: 
SM = (2 + 8 + 1) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1 

Moving on to deeper MAX operator - [MAX [SM 8 6 7] [MAX 2 1 2] 4]
SM 8 6 7 = (8 + 6 + 7) mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1

So now [MAX [SM 8 6 7] [MAX 2 1 2] 4] becomes [MAX 1 [MAX 2 1 2] 4]

Next , calculate the deeper MAX value. [MAX 2 1 2] = 2

So it becomes [MAX 1 2 4] = 4

So the total expression so far becomes : [SM 1 4 6].

Calculate SM 1 4 6:
SM = (1 + 4 + 6) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1

The original expression is now : [SM 1 [MAX [SM 1 [SM 0 3 5] [MAX 3 2 6]] 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]] 1] 

Again, go to the deepest operator, [SM 0 3 5] :
SM = (0 + 3 + 5) mod 10 = 8 mod 10 = 8 

So the longest bracket becomes : [MAX [SM 1 [SM 0 3 5] [MAX 3 2 6]] 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]] now becomes [MAX [SM 1 8 [MAX 3 2 6]] 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]]

Next, calculate the deepest MAX value. [MAX 3 2 6] = 6

So, [MAX [SM 1 8 [MAX 3 2 6]] 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]] now becomes [MAX [SM 1 8 6] 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]]

Now, calculate SM 1 8 6:
SM = (1 + 8 + 6) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5 

So, [MAX [SM 1 8 [MAX 3 2 6]] 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]] now becomes [MAX 5 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]]

Next, calculate the deepest operators [MAX 0 7 4] and [MIN 0 6 7]:
MAX = 7 and MIN = 0

So, [MAX 5 9 [SM [MAX 0 7 4] [MIN 0 6 7] 3]] now becomes [MAX 5 9 [SM 7 0 3]]

Calculate SM 7 0 3:
SM = (7 + 0 + 3) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0

So, [MAX 5 9 [SM 7 0 3]] now becomes [MAX 5 9 0] = 9

So, the original expression is now - [SM 1 9 1] 

Finally, calculate the expression SM 1 9 1:

- [SM 6 2 6] simplifies to 14 modulo 10 which is 4.
- [SM 4 0 4] simplifies to 8.
- So, [MAX 4 [SM 6 2 6] [SM 4 0 4]] simplifies to [MAX 4 4 8], which is 8.
- Now, [MIN [SM [MAX 9 5 5] [MIN 3 9 9] 4] [MAX 4 [SM 6 2 6] [SM 4 0 4]]] simplifies to [MIN 6 8], which is 6.

Let's move on to the second half:

- [SM 8 2 9] simplifies to 19 modulo 10, which is 9.
- [MAX 4 9 5] resolves to 9.
- So, [MAX 9 [SM 8 2 9] [MAX 4 9 5]] simplifies to [MAX 9 9], which is 9.
- [MIN 3 8 0] resolves to 0.
- [SM 3 8 1] simplifies to 12 modulo 10, which is 2.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we see two MAX operations: [MAX 9 4 5] and [MAX 1 9 6]. The maximum of 9, 4, and 5 is 9. The maximum of 1, 9, and 6 is 9. 

So, our new expression is [SM [SM [MAX 9 [MIN 8 6 6] 8] 7 [SM 4 9 [MAX 6 7 1]]] [SM [MIN [SM 4 1 7] [MIN 6 5 2] 1] [SM 2 [SM 0 5 5] [MIN 1 7 8]] 8] 7].

Next, we see two MIN operations: [MIN 8 6 6] and [MIN 6 5 2]. The minimum of 8, 6, and 6 is 6. The minimum of 6, 5, and 2 is 2. 

Our new expression is: [SM [SM [MAX 9 6 8] 7 [SM 4 9 [MAX 6 7 1]]] [SM [MIN [SM 4 1 7] 2 1] [SM 2 [SM 0 5 5] [MIN 1 7 8]] 8] 7].

Next, let's replace the remaining MAX operations: [MAX 9 6 8] and [MAX 6 7 1]. The maximum of 9, 6, and 8 is 9. The maximum of 6, 7, and 1 is 7. 

Our expression becomes: [SM [SM 9 7 [SM 4 9 7]] [SM [MIN [SM 4 1 7] 2 1] [SM 2 [SM 0 5 5] [MIN 1 7 8]] 8] 7].

Now, let's replace the SM operations inside the other operations: [SM 4 9 7] and [SM 0 5 5]. The sum of 4, 9, and 7 is 20, but for SM we use modulo 10, so we get 0. The sum of 0, 5, and 5 is 10, and modulo 10 is 0.

So, our expression becomes: [SM [SM 9 7 0] [SM [MIN [SM 4 1 7] 2 1] [SM 2 0 [MIN 1 7 8]] 8] 7].

Next, we see another SM operation, [SM 4 1 7]. The sum of 4, 1, and 7 is 12, but modulo 10 gives us 2.

So, our expression becomes: [SM [SM 9 7 0] [SM [MIN 2 2 1] [SM 2 0 [MIN 1 7 8]] 8] 7].

Next, the MIN operations: [MIN 2 2 1] and [MIN 1 7 8]. The minimum of 2, 2, and 1 is 1. The minimum of 1, 7, and 8 is 1.

So, our expression becomes: [SM [SM 9 7 0] [SM 1 [SM 2 0 1] 8] 7].

Next, we see another SM operation, [SM 2 0 1]. The sum of 2, 0, and 1 is 3.

So, our expression becomes: [SM [SM 9 7 0] [SM 1 3 8] 7].

Next, let's deal with the remaining SM operations: [SM 9 7 0], [SM 1 3 8], and [SM [SM 9 7 0] [SM 1 3 8] 7]. 
The sum of 9, 7, and 0 is 16, modulo 10 gives us 6. The sum of 1, 3, and 8 is 12, modulo 10 gives us 2. And finally, the sum of 6 (the result of the first SM), 2 (the result of the second SM), 

So, our final expression is: [SM 6 2 7], and once we add 6, 2, and 7, we get 15, but modulo 10 is 5.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, solve sub-expressions starting with the deepest one inside:

[SM [MAX 5 2 5] 3 [SM 8 8 2]] is [SM 5 3 8] because MAX 5 2 5 = 5 and SM 8 8 2 = 18, then we take the last digit which is 8.
So [SM [MAX 5 2 5] 3 [SM 8 8 2]] = [SM 5 3 8] = 16 % 10 = 6.

[SM 7 7 7] is equal to 21 % 10 = 1.

[MAX 5 [SM 7 7 7] [MIN 2 2 6]] is [MAX 5 1 2] = 5.

So, second part inside SM becomes [SM 4 6 5].

Thirdly, calculate the operation MIN and MAX in the third and last part of the expression:

[MIN 3 [MAX 2 7 8] [MIN 3 1 9]] is [MIN 3 8 1] = 1.
[MIN 3 9 3] is 3.

[SM [MIN 3 9 3] 1 [SM 1 9 8]] is [SM 3 1 8] = 12 % 10 = 2.

So, third part inside SM becomes [SM 1 2 5].

Finally, calculate SM operations:

[SM 4 6 5] = 15 % 10 = 5.
[SM 1 2 5] = 8 % 10 = 8.

[MIN 4 6 5] = MIN 4 5 = 4,
[MIN 1 4 3] = MIN 1 3 = 1.

Then our expression becomes:

[SM 0 [MIN [MAX 5 7 8] [MAX 2 5 9] 1] [MAX [MAX 6 4 [MIN 2 8 5]] [MAX 4 1 7] 0]].

The next step is to simplify the following:

[MAX 5 7 8] = MAX 7 8 = 8,
[MAX 2 5 9] = MAX 5 9 = 9,
[MAX 4 1 7] = MAX 4 7 = 7.

Now our expression is:

[SM 0 [MIN 8 9 1] [MAX [MAX 6 4 [MIN 2 8 5]] 7 0]].

We then simplify [MIN 2 8 5] to get 2 and [MIN 8 9 1] to get 1:

[SM 0 1 [MAX [MAX 6 4 2] 7 0]].

Evaluating above expression results:

[MAX 6 4 2] = MAX 6 2 = 6,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we start by evaluating the smallest possible expressions, i.e., the ones with the innermost brackets. 

The MAX and MIN operators simply return the maximum and minimum number from the list of numbers respectively. The SM operator sums up the numbers and then takes modulo 10, returning the remainder when the sum is divided by 10.

- [MAX 0 4 5] = 5
- [MAX 3 9 5] = 9
- [SM 5 9 1] = (5+9+1) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5 
- [MAX 5 0 2] = 5
- [SM 0 0 7] = 7
- [MIN 5 8 7] = 5
- [MAX 5 5 3] = 5

So, [MIN [MAX [SM [MAX 0 4 5] [MAX 3 9 5] 1] [MIN [MAX 5 0 2] 8 [SM 0 0 7]] 3] turns into [MIN 5].

Now, we continue evaluating the second part of the expression:

- [SM 8 5 0] = (8+5+0) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3
- [MIN 3 4 6] = 3
- [MAX 3 3 1] = 3
- [SM 8 1 0] = 9
- [MIN 6 2 7] = 2
- [MAX 9 2 8] = 9
- [MAX 3 5 9] = 9

So, [MAX [MAX [SM 8 5 0] [MIN 3 4 6] 1] 5 [MAX [SM 8 1 0] [MIN 6 2 7] 8]] turns into [MAX 9].

Finally, we evaluate the expression with MIN and MAX operators:

[SM 7 [MIN 8 [SM [MAX 8 1 8] 2 [MAX 1 5 5]]

MAX operations first. MAX takes the largest number:

[SM 7 [MIN 8 [SM 8 2 5]

Now apply SM operator which is sum modulo 10:

[SM 7 [MIN 8 5]

Now apply MIN operator which takes the minimum:

[SM 7 5]

Now apply SM operator:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can start by calculating the inner SM operations. 

SM 8 1 8 = (8+1+8) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7
SM 7 5 2 = (7+5+2) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4
SM 5 2 2 = (5+2+2) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9
SM 6 2 6 = (6+2+6) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4
SM 1 7 1 = (1+7+1) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9

The expression now will look like:
[SM [SM [SM 7 4 9] 0 [MIN [MAX 4 3 3] 9 5]] 8 [MIN 5 [SM 4 9 2] [MIN [MIN 5 3 8] [MIN 0 5 3] 3]]]

Then, we can calculate the inner MAX and MIN.

MAX 4 3 3 = max(4,3,3) = 4
MIN 4 9 5 = min(4,9,5) = 4
MIN 5 3 8 = min(5,3,8) = 3
MIN 0 5 3 = min(0,5,3) = 0

The expression now will look like:
[SM [SM [SM 7 4 9] 0 4] 8 [MIN 5 [SM 4 9 2] [MIN 3 0 3]]]

Then, calculate the SM and MIN operations again.

MIN(4,7,2) is 2, so MIN(8, 4, 2) is 2.
SM(8,4,0) is 2 (because 12 mod 10 is 2), so SM(3, 9, 2) is 4 (beacause 14 mod 10 is 4). 
MAX(9,3,1) is 9, so SM(8,9,9) is 6 (because 26 mod 10 is 6).
MAX(9,0,5) is 9, so MAX(9,6,9) is 9.

Therefore, SM[8 1 6] = (8+1+6) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5.

In the expression ""[MAX 8 0 4]"", MAX indicates maximum. It is the greatest number among the numbers.
Therefore, MAX[8 0 4] = 8.

The expression ""[MAX 0 5 1]"" is equal to 5.

The expression ""[MIN 1 4 3]"" is equal to 1.

The expression ""[MIN 9 2 3]"" is equal to 2.

Substitute these values and the expression will be:

We have [MIN 4 7 6] = 4 and [MIN 6 1 0] = 0, so we can replace these within the bracket to get [SM 4 [SM 4 0] 9].

Similarly, [SM 3 5 7] = ((3+5+7) mod 10) = 5, [MAX 3 2 0] = 3, [MAX 8 8 7] = 8, [MAX 9 9 2] = 9, [SM 7 1 2] = ((7+1+2) mod 10) = 0 and [MAX 6 4 6] = 6.

Substitute all these to get the new expression as:

Now for the next layer of brackets we get [SM 4 0] = ((4+0) mod 10) = 4, [MIN 5 0 3] = 0, [MIN 8 4 9] = 4, [MAX 8 0 6] = 8.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the MAX and SM operators inside the parenthesis. 

[SM [MAX 2 2 9] [SM 2 0 2] 2] equals [SM 9 [SM 2 0 2] 2] equals [SM 9 4 2] equals 5 (because 9 + 4 + 2 = 15 and 15 modulo 10 equal 5).

[MAX [SM 6 7 9] 9 [SM 6 7 7]] equals [MAX 2 9 0] equal 9 (we determined MAX operate first before SM).

[SM 0 [MIN 9 2 5] [SM 0 8 7]] equals [SM 0 2 [SM 0 8 7]] equals [SM 0 2 5] equals 7 (the similar rule applies here as well).

[SM 4 [MAX 1 4 9] [MAX 1 1 2]] equals [SM 4 9 [MAX 1 1 2]] equals [SM 4 9 2] equals 5 (here, we perform each operation one by one).

[MIN 5 9] equals 5.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we'll simplify the innermost functions. Starting from the left:

[SM [MAX [SM [MAX 8 7 2] [MIN 0 8 9] 4] 0 [SM 2 [SM 5 3 2] [MIN 1 2 9]]], this becomes:

[SM [MAX [SM 8 [MIN 0 8 9] 4] 0 [SM 2 [SM 5 3 2] 1]]

Simplifying further, it becomes:

[SM [MAX [SM 8 0 4] 0 [SM 2 [SM 5 3 2] 1]]

Solving for the modulo sum of 8, 0 and 4, we get 2 because (8+0+4) modulo 10 is 2:

[SM [MAX 2 0 [SM 2 [SM 5 3 2] 1]]

The synchronized modulo sum of 5, 3 and 2 is 0 because (5+3+2) modulo 10 is 0:

[SM [MAX 2 0 [SM 2 0 1]]]

This further simplifies to:

[SM [MAX 2 0 3]]

The MAX operation yields the highest value, which is 3 in this case.

So far, we have solved the first part of the expression and got 3:

[3 [SM 6 [SM 0 [MAX 8 6 9] [MIN 5 0 1]] [MAX [MAX 9 3 2] 5 [MIN 1 4 1]]] 2]].

Now, we simplify the second part in the same way:

[SM 6 [SM 0 [MAX 8 6 9] [MIN 5 0 1]] [MAX [MAX 9 3 2] 5 [MIN 1 4 1]]] 2]].

It first simplifies to:

[SM 6 [SM 0 9 [MIN 5 0 1]] [MAX 9 5 [MIN 1 4 1]]] 2]].

Next, it simplifies to:

[SM 6 [SM 0 9 0] [MAX 9 5 1]].

The SM operator will produce 9 when applied to 0, 9 and 0, because (0+9+0) modulo 10 is 9:

[SM 6 9 [MAX 9 5 1]] 2].

MAX operator will produce 9 when applied to 9, 5 and 1, so we have:

[SM 6 9 9] 2].

Our final expression is thus [SM 3 4 2].

Now we just find the modulo sum of the numbers 3, 4 and 2 which is 9 because (3+4+2) modulo 10 is 9.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we need to evaluate the innermost expressions involving MIN, MAX, and SM. We start by evaluating any MAX or MIN expressions, because SM depends on the results of these expressions:

   - MAX 7 1 1: Returns 7, as 7 is the largest number.
   - MAX 4 6 3: Returns 6, as 6 is the largest number.
   - MIN 2 4 8: Returns 2, as 2 is the smallest number.
   - MIN 8 6 7: Returns 6, as 6 is the smallest number.
   - MAX 6 2 5: Returns 6, as 6 is the largest number.

2. Our intermediate expression then looks like:

3. Evaluate the remaining SM expressions:

   - SM 7 6 4: Returns 7, as (7+6+4) modulo 10 equals 7.
   - SM 9 5 8: Returns 2, as (9+5+8) modulo 10 equals 2.
   - SM 3 4 7: Returns 4, as (3+4+7) modulo 10 equals 4.
   - SM 2 7 8: Returns 7, as (2+7+8) modulo 10 equals 7.

4. Our intermediate expression then looks like:

   [MAX [SM 7 8 [SM 2 2 5]] 5 [MIN 7 [SM 4 1 7] 6]]
   
5. Now we compute the remaining SM expressions:

   - SM 7 8 2 2 5: Returns 4, as (7+8+2+2+5) modulo 10 equals 4.
   - SM 4 1 7: Returns 2, as (4+1+7) modulo 10 equals 2.

6. The expression simplifies to [MAX 4 5 [MIN 7 2 6]], where we need to compute MIN 7 2 6.

Next, evaluate MIN 5 4 5, MIN 6 4 0, MIN 4 7 7, MIN 1 1 6, and MIN 9 2 1 from left to right i.e., 4, 0, 4, 1, and 1 in respective order. The expression would be: 
[MIN [MAX 3 [MAX 6 0 2] [1 4 0]] [MIN [MIN 0 0 4] 4 [MIN 4 1 1]] 2].

Now, evaluate MIN 0 0 4 i.e., 0. The expression turns into: 
[MIN [MAX 3 [MAX 6 0 2] [1 4 0]] [MIN 0 4 [MIN 4 1 1]] 2].

From the right, calculate MIN 4 1 1 i.e., 1. Now the expression becomes:

[MIN [MAX 3 6 0] [0 2] 2].

The processor can only MAX three numbers at a time. So, MAX 3 6 0 = 6, and the expression simplifies to:

So the expression becomes:

[MAX 0 [SM [MAX 0 8 5] [MAX [MAX 1 5 9] 7 [MAX 6 9 4]] 1] [SM [MIN [SM 9 3 9] 5 7] 2 [MAX [SM 9 6 0] [SM 9 9 1] 6]]].

Now, again, let's solve the most nested parts:

- SM 9 3 9 equals 21, which is 1 modulo 10.
- MAX 1 5 9 returns 9, because 9 is the biggest number.
- SM 9 6 0 equals 15, so 5 as a result when take modulo 10.
- SM 9 9 1 equals 19, which is 9 modulo 10.

The expression becomes:

[MAX 0 [SM [MAX 0 8 5] [MAX 9 7 [MAX 6 9 4]] 1] [SM [MIN 1 5 7] 2 [MAX 5 9 6]]].

Solve again:

- MAX 0 8 5 returns 8, which is the biggest number.
- MAX 6 9 4 returns 9, which is the biggest number.
- MIN 1 5 7 returns 1, which is the smallest number.

So, the expression becomes:

[MAX 0 [SM 8 [MAX 9 7 9] 1] [SM 1 2 [MAX 5 9 6]]].

Again, let's solve most nested parts:

- MAX 9 7 9 again returns 9, which is the biggest number.
- MAX 5 9 6 returns 9, which is the biggest number.

So, the expression becomes:

[MAX 0 [SM 8 9 1] [SM 1 2 9]].

At this point, we can find out rest of the elements:

- SM 8 9 1 equals 18, so 8 as a result when take modulo 10.
- SM 1 2 9 equals 12, so 2 as a result when take modulo 10.

So, the final expression is:

[MAX 0 8 2].

And finally:

- MAX 0 8 2 return 8, which is the biggest number. Hence, the final answer is 8.

Now, substitute these values back into the equation:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's break down the SM numbers you have. SM refers to sum modulo 10. 

SM 6 9 4: 6 + 9 + 4 mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9.
SM 1 0 8: 1 + 0 + 8 mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9.
SM 4 8 3: 4 + 8 + 3 mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5.
SM 2 0 3: 2 + 0 + 3 mod 10 = 5 mod 10 = 5.
SM 4 9 2: 4 + 9 + 2 mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5.

So, these can be simplified to:

Moving onto MIN and MAX.

MAX 3 [MIN 5 9 9]: Since min of 5, 9, 9 is 5, max between 5 and 3 is 5.
MAX 5 [MAX 1 1 0]: The max among 1, 1, 0 is 1. So, max between 1 and 5 is 5.

MIN 4 5 [MAX 6 2 7]: The max among 6, 2, 7 is 7. So, min between 7 and 4 is 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: Calculate everything inside the deepest square brackets.

[MIN 9 [MAX 0 3 7] [MIN 7 7 0]] -> the maximum of 0, 3 and 7 is 7 and the minimum of 7, 7 and 0 is 0. Therefore it becomes [MIN 9 7 0] which gives us 0.

[MIN 0 2 7] -> the minimum of 0, 2 and 7 is 0.

[MAX 2 8 0] -> the maximum of 2, 8 and 0 is 8.

[MIN 5 4 4] -> the minimum of 5, 4 and 4 is 4.

[MAX 6 6 6] -> the maximum of 6, 6 and 6 is 6.

So the given expression changes to :

[MIN [SM 9 0] [MIN 0 6 8]] 
[MAX [SM [SM 1 7 3] [MIN 0 5 9] 6] 1 [MAX 4 7 6]]

Step 2: Calculate everything inside the second deepest square brackets.

[SM 9 0] -> The sum of 9 and 0 modulo 10 gives 9.

[SM 1 7 3] -> The sum of 1, 7 and 3 modulo 10 gives 1.

[MIN 0 5 9] -> The minimum of 0, 5 and 9 is 0.

So the given expression changes to :

[MIN 9 [MIN 0 6 8]] 
[MAX [SM 1 0 6] 1 [MAX 4 7 6]]

Step 3: Calculate everything inside the second last square brackets.

[SM 1 0 6] -> The sum of 1, 0 and 6 modulo 10 gives 7.

[MIN 0 6 8] -> The minimum of 0, 6 and 8 is 0.

[MAX 4 7 6] -> The maximum of 4,7 and 6 is 7.

So the given expression changes to :

[MIN 9 0] 
[MAX 7 1 7]

Step 4: Again calculate everything inside the square brackets.

[MIN 9 0] -> The minimum of 9 and 0 is 0.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the expressions inside each of the operators. 
- First, [SM 1 7 1] simplifies to 9 (since (1+7+1) modulo 10 = 9).
- Second, [MIN 3 3 3] simplifies to 3 (since 3 is the minimum of 3, 3 and 3).
- Third, [SM 2 0 6] simplifies to 8 ((2+0+6) modulo 10 = 8)
- Fourth, [MIN 0 9 9] simplifies to 0 (since 0 is the minimum of 0, 9 and 9).
- Fifth, [SM 7 8 3] simplifies to 8 ((7+8+3) modulo 10 = 8)
- Sixth, [SM 0 9 2] simplifies to 1 ((0+9+2) modulo 10 = 1).


So the expression now becomes:
[MAX 9 [MIN [SM 9 9] 6 [SM 8 0 1]] [MAX [SM [MAX 1 0 7] [MAX 5 5 9] 3] 5 [MAX 8 8 1] ]].

Now let's simplify further:
- [SM 9 9] simplifies to 8 ((9+9) modulo 10 = 8).
- [SM 8 0 1] simplifies to 9 ((8+0+1) modulo 10 = 9).
- [SM [MAX 1 0 7] [MAX 5 5 9] 3] simplifies to [SM 7 9 3] which further simplifies to 9 ((7+9+3) modulo 10 = 9).
- [MAX 8 8 1] simplifies to 8 (since maximum out of 8, 8, and 1 is 8)

So now the expression simplifies to:
[MAX 9 [MIN 8 6 9] [MAX 9 5 8]].

We can further simplify the [MIN 8 6 9] expression to be 6 (since minimum out of 8,6,9 is 6) and [MAX 9 5 8] expression to be 9 since maximum out of 9, 5, 8 is 9). 

This simplifies the whole expression to:

Therefore, the result of the given expression is 9.",9,9
