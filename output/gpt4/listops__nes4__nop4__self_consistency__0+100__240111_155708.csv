A: Let's think step-by-step.","The inside operations always go first. 

The first operator to be evaluated is [MIN 8 9 2 2], which is equal to 2 because 2 is the smallest number within the list. 

The same goes for [MIN 3 0 7 8], which is equal to 0 since 0 is the smallest number in the given list. 

Moving onto the next operation, we have [MIN 5 7 8 2], which is equal to 2. 

Similarly, [MIN 4 8 0 3] gives 0. 

So the original expression simplifies to [SM [MAX 5 [MAX 6 2 0 6] [MIN 2 3 4 0]] 8 [MIN [MIN 3 [SM 4 3 2 0] [SM 2 8 1 6] 9] 2 [MIN [MIN 5 8 3 5] 0 [MIN 2 5 4 8] 9] 4] 9 5]. 

Continuing in the similar manner, we calculate [SM 4 3 2 0] which is equal to (4+3+2+0) mod 10 = 9.

In the same way, [SM 2 8 1 6] is equal to (2+8+1+6) mod 10 = 7.

Following the innermost first rule, the term [MIN 5 8 3 5] yields 3, and [MIN 2 5 4 8] gives 2. 

The original expression simplifies to [SM [MAX 5 [MAX 6 2 0 6] [MIN 2 3 4 0]] 8 [MIN [MIN 3 9 7 9] 2 [MIN 3 0 2 9] 4] 9 5].

[MIN [MIN 3 9 7 9] gives 3 and [MIN 3 0 2 9] gives 0.

So, the expression further simplifies to [SM [6 0] 8 [MIN [3 2 0 4] 9 5] = [SM [6 0] 8 [0 9 5].

[MIN 4 9 4 0] gives the minimum value, which is 0. 

Similarly, [MIN 8 9 1 3] gives 1.

For [MIN 3 [SM 8 9 4 0] 1 [MIN 9 7 9 4]], first we calculate [SM 8 9 4 0] which gives (8+9+4+0) modulo 10 = 21 modulo 10 = 1, and [MIN 9 7 9 4] which gives 4. So, the operation becomes [MIN 3 1 1 4] and gives 1.

[MIN 4 9 3 5] gives 3.

[MAX 6 7 7 4] gives the maximum value, which is 7.

[MAX 1 9 8 2] gives 9.

[MIN 9 0 1 2] gives the minimum value, which is 0.

[SM [SM 9 [SM 0 6 1 9] 7 1] [SM [MAX 0 3 2 7] 3 [SM 9 3 0 0] 9] 8 4].

Now we perform the SM operation on [SM 0 6 1 9] which gives (0+6+1+9) modulo 10 = 16 modulo 10 = 6, and on [SM 9 3 0 0] which gives (9+3+0+0) modulo 10 = 12 modulo 10 = 2.

[MAX 2 2 5 8] evaluates to 8 (maximum of those numbers is 8)

[SM 7 3 1 1] evaluates to 2 (sum of those numbers is 12, but the modulo 10 operation would result in 2)

[SM 0 8 5 9] evaluates to 2 (sum of those numbers is 22, but the modulo 10 operation would result in 2)

[MIN 1 1 1 4] evaluates to 1 (minimum of those numbers is 1)

[SM 8 7 1 4] evaluates to 0 (sum of those numbers is 20, but the modulo 10 operation would result in 0)

[SM 7 6 5 1] evaluates to 9 (sum of those numbers is 19, but the modulo 10 operation would result in 9)

[MAX 6 6 6 8] evaluates to 8 (maximum of those numbers is 8)

We now substitute these results back into the original expression which gives us:

[MIN 3 [MIN 7 [MIN 4 8 0 [MIN 9 8 8 3]] 5 [MIN 6 2 4 2]] [MIN 8 [MIN 1 9 4 0] [MIN 9 4 3 8] 0] 1]

Next, we can simplify the expressions within the brackets further:

[MIN 7 [MIN 4 8 0 [MIN 9 8 8 3]] simplifies to 0 (as 0 is the minimum in these numbers)

[MIN 6 2 4 2] simplifies to 2 (as 2 is the minimum in these numbers)

[MIN 1 9 4 0] simplifies to 0 (as 0 is the minimum in these numbers)

[MIN 9 4 3 8] simplifies to 3 (as 3 is the minimum in these numbers)

Again, we substitute these results back into the expression:

[MIN 3 0 5 2] [MIN 8 0 3 0] 1]

Finally, we simplify the remaining expressions:

[MIN 3 0 5 2] simplifies to 0 (as 0 is the minimum in these numbers)

[MIN 8 0 3 0] simplifies to 0 (as 0 is the minimum in these numbers)

Substituting these results into the expression, we get:

[MIN 1 3 6 3] = 1
[MIN 5 0 0 9] = 0
[MIN 1 7 0 9] = 0
[MIN 5 9 9 1] = 1

[SM 8 6 3 0] is 7 (17 mod 10).
[MIN 6 5 4 1] is 1.

The expression is now:

[MAX 1 4 9 0] = 9.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we will solve all innermost layer brackets as they have no connections with operators from outside layers.

[[MAX 5 5 3 2] = 5] - maximum out of (5, 5, 3, 2)

[[MAX 2 6 3 9] = 9] - maximum out of (2, 6, 3, 9)

[[SM 3 6 [MAX 0 0 9 2] [MIN 6 1 0 7]]] = 8

Let's explain this. First take maximum out of (0, 0, 9, 2), then minimum out of (6, 1, 0, 7). So it turns into [SM 3 6 9 0] = (3 + 6 + 9 + 0) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

[[MIN 2 6 1 2] = 1] - minimum out of (2, 6, 1, 2)

[[MAX 1 4 8 0] = 8] - maximum out of (1, 4, 8, 0)

[[SM 2 6 6 2]] = 6

Explain: (2 + 6 + 6 + 2) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6

Now let's substitute these results back to the original expression:

[MIN [MAX 1 4 5 4 4 9] 8] [MIN 5 1 9 [MIN 2 3 7 8]] [MIN 8 7 6 8] 9] 8 3

and apply all inner layer brackets operation again:

[[MAX 1 4 5 4 4 9] = 9]

[[MIN 2 3 7 8] = 2]

So the expression now becomes:

[MIN 9 8] [MIN 5 1 9 2] [MIN 8 7 6 8] 9 8 3

Finally apply three remaining MIN operations:

[MIN 9 8] = 8

[MIN 5 1 9 2] = 1

[MIN 8 7 6 8] = 6

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we will simplify the nested operators SM, MIN and MAX from innermost braces. 
[SM 5 6 5 7] uses addition and modulo 10 giving us the result 3.
[SM 0 5 0 1] also uses addition and modulo 10 which gives the result 6.
[MAX 4 2 7 6] finds the highest value giving us the result 7.
[MAX 9 9 5 5] also finds the highest value giving us the result 9.

After replacing these results in the primary equation, we will get:

Moving further, we simplify the new innermost terms.
[MIN 5 3 1 8] and [MIN 6 5 3 9] both find the lowest value, giving us 1. [MIN 3 6 9 9], [MIN 3 6 9 9] and [SM 7 1 2 6] also find the lowest and sum modulo 10 respectively, giving us 3 and 6. [SM 3 3 0 1] uses addition and modulo 10 giving us the result of 7.

After replacing these results in the primary equation, we get:
[MIN [MIN [SM 3 1 3 1] 5 3 3] 2 4 [SM 3 6 [MAX 2 7 0 9] 0]].

The latest innermost terms [SM 3 1 3 1] and [MAX 2 7 0 9] simplify to 8 and 9.
Finally we get the primary equation:
[MIN [MIN 8 5 3 3] 2 4 [SM 3 6 9 0]].

Now we simply have to calculate the MIN and SM operators in order.
[MIN 8 5 3 3] gives us 3. And [SM 3 6 9 0] gives us 8.
Substitute these results to get:

[SM 4 8 9 7] = 28 mod 10 = 8. 
[MIN 2 3 8 1] = 1.
So we get [SM 0 8 1 0] which results in 9.

On the other hand, 
[MIN 4 7 8 2] = 2.
[MIN 2 8 2 5] = 2.
So we get [SM 9 2 4 2] which results in 17 mod 10 = 7.

So far our equation become like this:

For the next set of brackets,
[SM 5 0 2 2] = 9.
[MAX 0 2 1 3] = 3.

On the other hand, 
[SM 6 0 4 2] = 12 mod 10 = 2.
[SM 6 9 9 1] = 25 mod 10 = 5.

3) SM 0 4 9 5 = (0+4+9+5) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8
   So, the expression becomes:

Now, let's move to the other side of the original expression:

6) MAX 0 7 9 9 = 9

10) SM 8 4 4 5 = (8+4+4+5) mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the second part of the equation: [SM 8 [MAX 7 [MAX 9 7 5 7] [MAX 7 5 3 5] 4] 3 [SM [SM 2 2 2 7] 5 9 [MAX 6 8 1 1]]].

We have two MAX operations that we can resolve: [MAX 9 7 5 7] which is 9 and [MAX 7 5 3 5] which is also 7. The equation now looks like this:

[SM 8 [MAX 7 9 7 4] 3 [SM [SM 2 2 2 7] 5 9 [MAX 6 8 1 1]]].

Find the MAX for 7, 9, 7, 4, resulting in 9:

[SM 8 9 3 [SM [SM 2 2 2 7] 5 9 [MAX 6 8 1 1]]].

Resolve the next MAX operation ([MAX 6 8 1 1]) to get 8:

[SM 8 9 3 [SM [SM 2 2 2 7] 5 9 8]].

Resolve the SM operation ([SM 2 2 2 7]) to get 13, but we need it modulo 10, so it's actually 3:

[SM 8 9 3 [SM 3 5 9 8]].

Resolve the remaining SM operation ([SM 3 5 9 8]) to get 25, but modulo 10, so it's actually 5:

[SM 8 9 3 5].

Resolve the final SM operation to get 25, but modulo 10, so it is 5.

So, the final result of the second part of the equation is 5.

Now, let's simplify the first part of the equation: [MIN 2 [MIN [SM 9 [SM 1 6 0 9] [MIN 8 4 6 7] 8] [MAX [MAX 8 7 2 6] 2 [MAX 7 3 2 9] 8] 5 9]].

The first operation to resolve here is [SM 1 6 0 9] which is 16 modulo 10, resulting in 6. The equation is now:

[MIN 2 [MIN [SM 9 6 [MIN 8 4 6 7] 8] [MAX [MAX 8 7 2 6] 2 [MAX 7 3 2 9] 8] 5 9]].

Next, resolve the MIN operation ([MIN 8 4 6 7]), which will result into 4:

[MIN 2 [MIN [SM 9 6 4 8] [MAX [MAX 8 7 2 6] 2 [MAX 7 3 2 9] 8] 5 9]].

Then, we compute the SM operation ([SM 9 6 4 8]) resulting in 27 modulo 10, so it's actually 7:

[MIN 2 [MIN 7 [MAX [MAX 8 7 2 6] 2 [MAX 7 3 2 9] 8] 5 9]].

Next, resolve the two MAX operations: [MAX 8 7 2 6] is 8 and [MAX 7 3 2 9] is 9:

[MIN 2 [MIN 7 [MAX 8 2 9 8] 5 9]].

Find the MAX for 8, 2, 9, 8, resulting in 9:

[MIN 2 [MIN 7 9 5 9]].

Finally, we find the MIN among 7, 9, 5, 9 and this is 5:

[MIN 2 5].

So, the MIN operation ([MIN 2 5]) gives us 2.

Now we combine the results of the two parts, which were found to be 2 and 5. Since there was no operator between them in the initial expression, we will consider them as a sorted list. Therefore, the result is [2, 5].","[2, 5]",2

[MAX 7 9 8 1] = 9 (since this is the maximum number in the list)
[SM 4 2 6 0] = 2 (since the sum of the elements in the list is 12 and 12 modulo 10 is 2)
[SM 8 6 5 0] = 9 (since the sum of the elements in the list is 19 and 19 modulo 10 is 9)

[MIN 4 9 0 8] = 0 (since this is the minimum number in the list)

Now the expression becomes:

[MAX [SM [SM 7 0 0 7] [MAX 4 9 2 3] 1 6] 1 4 [MAX 2 [MAX 9 6 6 4] 4 [MIN 3 6 6 0]]]

Now let's find the results for SM and MAX functions in the above expression:

[SM 7 0 0 7] = 4 (since 7+0+0+7=14 and 14 modulo 10 is 4)
[MAX 4 9 2 3] = 9 (since this is the highest number in the list)
[MAX 9 6 6 4] = 9 (since this is the highest number in the list)
[MIN 3 6 6 0] = 0 (since this is the smallest number in the list)

So, the expression becomes:

[MAX [SM 4 9 1 6] 1 4 [MAX 2 9 4 0]]

Calculate SM function and replace it in the expression:

[SM 4 9 1 6] = 0 (since 4+9+1+6=20 and 20 modulo 10 is 0)

So, the expression becomes:

[MAX 0 1 4 [MAX 2 9 4 0]]

Next, calculate the MAX function and replace it in the expression:

[MAX 2 9 4 0] = 9 (as this is the highest number in the list)

So, the expression becomes:

[MAX 0 1 4 9]

Finally, determine the MAX function to get the final result:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the maximum and minimum values enclosed in brackets. 
[Max 7 2 3 9] = 9
[Min 2 4 3 6] = 2
[Min 4 3 2 3] = 2
[Max 3 8 7 8] = 8
[Max 9 9 4 9] = 9
[Max 3 3 2 4] = 4
[Sm 0 4 7 2] = (0+4+7+2) mod 10 = 3

Now, substitute these values back into the original expression:

SM 2 [Max 0 [Min 9 2 6 3] [Min 6 0 2 [SM 0 6 9 5]] 1] 8 [Max 1 [Min 6 8 5 9] 0 [SM 4 3 8 3]].

Next, evaluate the sum modulo operation and substitute:
[SM 0 6 9 5] = (0+6+9+5) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0.

Substitute back into the expression:

SM 2 [Max 0 [Min 9 2 6 3] [Min 6 0 2 0] 1] 8 [Max 1 [Min 6 8 5 9] 0 [SM 4 3 8 3]].

Evaluate the remaining min and max operations:

[Max 0 [Min 9 2 6 3] [Min 6 0 2 0] 1] = Max [0, Min [9,2,6,3], Min [6,0,2,0], 1] = Max [0,2,0,1] = 2.

[Max 1 [Min 6 8 5 9] 0 [SM 4 3 8 3]] = Max [1, Min [6,8,5,9], 0, SM [4,3,8,3]] = Max [1,5,0,[SM 4 3 8 3]].

Evaluate [SM 4 3 8 3] = (4+3+8+3) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8.

So, the expression becomes Max [1,5,0,8] = 8.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's break the expression into smaller units and solve them individually.

In the whole expression, the innermost units are:

[MIN 5 4 1 2] = 1

[SM 9 8 7 1] = 5 (Sum of 9, 8, 7, 1 is 25, and 25 modulo 10 is 5)

[SM 9 4 8 1] = 2 (Sum of 9, 4, 8, 1 is 22, and 22 modulo 10 is 2)

[SM 6 5 3 5] = 9 (Sum of 6, 5, 3, 5 is 19, and 19 modulo 10 is 9)

[MIN 3 6 2 3] = 2

[SM 9 4 3 1] = 7 (Sum of 9, 4, 3, 1 is 17, and 17 modulo 10 is 7)

[MAX 4 2 1 4] = 4

[MIN 2 4 6 4] = 2

Now, substitute the solved units into the original expression, which then simplifies to:

[MIN 8 [MIN [SM 5 8 1 5] [MIN 5 2 9 3] 4 9] [SM [MIN 9 8 2 7] 3 [SM 4 3 2 0] 1] 5].

In the above expression, the next innermost units are:

[SM 5 8 1 5] = 9 (Sum of 5, 8, 1, 5 is 19, and 19 modulo 10 is 9)

[MIN 5 2 9 3] = 2

[SM 4 3 2 0] = 9 (Sum of 4, 3, 2, 0 is 9, and 9 modulo 10 is 9)

Substitute these values into the expression:

[MIN 8 [MIN 9 2 4 9] [SM [MIN 9 8 2 7] 3 9 1] 5].

In the above expression, [MIN 9 2 4 9] = 2

[MIN 9 8 2 7] = 2

Substitute them into the expression:

[MIN 8 2 [SM 2 3 9 1] 5].

Now, [SM 2 3 9 1] = 5 (Sum of 2, 3, 9, 1 is 15, and 15 modulo 10 is 5)

So, the final expression would be: [MIN 8 2 5 5], which equals 2 (The minimum number among 8, 2, 5, 5 is 2).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can calculate the expressions in between the square brackets.

[MIN 0 [MIN [MAX 9 7 4 0] [MAX 4 1 1 3] 6 4]]. We first calculate the MAX expressions: MAX 9 7 4 0 equals to 9, MAX 4 1 1 3 equals to 4. Then, we substitute back: [MIN 0 [MIN 9 4 6 4]]. After performing the MIN calculation for the numbers in the square brackets, we get: [MIN 0 4]. The MIN of 0 and 4 is 0.

The second square brackets expression [SM [SM 8 2 9 1] 2 2 [MAX 4 6 8 7]] simplifies to [SM 20 2 2 8] which yields (20 + 2 + 2 + 8) mod 10 = 32 mod 10 = 2.

The third [MIN 4 [MIN 2 [SM 0 5 2 0] 7 [MAX 4 9 1 5]] simplifies first from inside the parenthesis as follows: [MIN 4 [MIN 2 7 9]] which equals [MIN 4 2] which yields 2.

The last square brackets expression [MIN [MIN 3 0 9 9] 1 7 [SM 5 0 7 8]] simplifies as follows: [MIN 0 1 7 20 mod 10] => [MIN 0 1 7 0] which yields 0.

Now, we can rewrite the expression with the obtained numbers:

[SM 0 2 2 0 6]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's look into the inner expressions:

1) The expression [MAX 1 0 0 5] will yield the highest number, which is 5. 
2) Similarly, [MIN 8 4 4 0] will give the smallest number, which is 0.
3) [SM 3 4 9 0] will give the sum of the numbers 3, 4, 9 and 0 modulo 10, which is 6 (Because 3+4+9+0 = 16. 16 modulo 10 is 6).
4) [SM 9 4 2 5] will result in the sum 20 modulo 10, which is 0.

5) [MAX 1 8 5 5] will give the highest number, which is 8.
6) [MIN 6 3 7 4] will give the smallest number, which is 3.
7) [MAX 1 8 1 5] will give the highest number, which is 8.

[MIN 2 5 [MAX 9 [MIN 5 5 8 0] 8 [MIN 3 6 0 4]] [MAX [MAX 0 4 8 3] 0 [MIN 8 8 9 8] 1]]

1) [MIN 5 5 8 0] will give the smallest number, which is 0.
2) [MIN 3 6 0 4] will give the smallest number, which is 0.
3) [MAX 0 4 8 3] will give the highest number, which is 8.

Now, we perform the remaining calculations:

1) [MAX 9 0 8 0] will give the highest number, which is 9.
2) [MAX 8 0 8 1] will give the highest number, which is 8.

Substituting these results back into the main expression, we have:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the innermost expressions:
`SM 5 2 0 4` equals `1`, because sum of the numbers is 11 and 11 modulo 10 is 1.
`MAX 8 8 7 1` equals `8`, because 8 is the maximum number in this list.
`MIN 4 6 7 6` equals `4`, because 4 is the minimum number in this list.
`SM 5 0 0 2` equals `7`, because sum of the numbers is 7 and 7 modulo 10 is 7.
`MIN 4 7 8 0` equals `0`, because 0 is the minimum number in this list.
`MAX 7 1 4 9` equals `9`, because 9 is the maximum number in this list.

Thus, the initial expression turns into:
`MAX [MIN 7 [MAX 6 1 1 [MIN 0 4 6 0]] [SM 8 4 0 2] 3] 9 0 [MIN [MIN [MIN 9 7 5 1] 7 6 2] 8 9 [MAX 0 9 2 0]]`.

The next step calculate the following expressions:
`MAX 6 1 1` equals `6`, because 6 is the maximum number in this list.
`SM 8 4 0 2` equals `4`, because sum of the numbers is 14 and 14 modulo 10 is 4.
`MIN [MIN 9 7 5 1] 7 6 2` equals `1`, because the minimum number in the nested expression is 1 and it is also the minimum number in the outer list.
`MAX 0 9 2 0` equals `9`, because 9 is the maximum number in this list.

Then the expression simplifies to:
`MAX [MIN 7 6 [MIN 0 4 6 0]] 4 3] 9 0 [MIN 1 8 9 9]`.

Next, evaluate:
`MIN 7 6` equals `6`, since 6 is the smaller number.
`MIN 0 4 6 0` equals `0`, since 0 is the smaller number.
`MIN 1 8 9 9` equals `1`, since 1 is the smaller number.

The expression further simplifies to:
`MAX 6 0 4 3 9 0 1`.

Finally, the expression `MAX 6 0 4 3 9 0 1` evaluates to `9`, since 9 is the maximum number in this list.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to simplify the expressions within the brackets starting from the deepest nested one. In the deepest nested bracket, we have two MAX functions and two SM functions:

Here are the calculations for MAX functions:
MAX(2, 0, 1, 6) = 6, MAX(6, 0, 2, 7) = 7, MAX(7, 0, 6, 5) = 7, MAX(8, 2, 4, 3) = 8, MAX(6, 3, 9, 5) = 9

For the SM functions, we just add up all the numbers and take the last digit:
SM(6, 6, 2, 3) = (6 + 6 + 2 + 3) mod 10 = 7, SM(5, 6, 0, 6) = (5 + 6 + 0 + 6) mod 10 = 7

So, the expression becomes:
MIN(6, 0, SM(SM(MIN(6, 7, 0, 6), 7, 3, 6), SM(9, 7, 7, 1, 6, 1), MIN(1, MAX(8, 0, 3, 7), MAX(9, 7, 9, 1), 0))

Next, solve for the MIN functions:
MIN(6, 7, 0, 6) = 0, MIN(1, 8, 9, 0) = 0

The simplified expression becomes:
MIN(6, 0, SM(SM(0, 7, 3, 6), SM(9, 7, 7, 1, 6, 1), 0))

Next, we calculate the SM function again:
SM(0, 7, 3, 6) = (0 + 7 + 3 + 6) mod 10 = 6, SM(9, 7, 7, 1, 6, 1) = (9 + 7 + 7 + 1 + 6 + 1) mod 10 = 3

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we should carry out the operations for the lists that are the most deeply nested. In the first list after ""SM 4"", there are two MAX functions. The first MAX function receives a list with a SM operation and three integers. The SM operation, in turn, receives 2, 2, 6, 4. The sum of these numbers is 14. The number 14 modulo 10 (the remainder when 14 is divided by 10) is 4. So: [SM 2 2 6 4] yields 4. Now, we can solve the first MAX function: [MAX 4 8 8 9] yields 9.

2. The second MAX function in the list after ""SM 4"" also receives a list with a SM operation. This SM operation receives 6, 3, 8, 7, which sum is 24. Again, applying modulo 10, we get: [SM 6 3 8 7] yields 4. Now, we can solve this function: [MAX 4 9 8] yields 9.

3. Now, we can solve the full list after ""SM 4"": [SM 3 9 9 3] = 3 + 9 + 9 + 3 = 24, which modulo 10 is 4.

4. The list after MAX receives two MAX functions. The first MAX function receives a list with a MIN operation. The MIN function in its turn receives 9, 0, 5, 0. The minimum value in this list is 0. So this is replaced by 0 in the first MAX function: [MAX 4 0 5 0] which the maximum value is 5.

5. The second MAX function in the list after the MAX also receives a list with a MIN operation. The MIN function in its turn receives 2, 9, 6, 8. The minimum value in this list is 2. So this is replaced by 2 in the second MAX function: [MAX 1 2 8 5], which the maximum value is 8.

6. Now, we can solve the full list after ""MAX"": [MAX 5 8 0 4] yields 8.

7. Finally, we solve the entire statement: [SM 4 4 8 1] equals 4 + 4 + 8 + 1 = 17, which modulo 10 is 7.

And then, we calculate the SM operations:

= [SM 2 [MIN 22 [MAX 20 1 4 20] 0 9] 0 [MIN 21 1 [MIN 8 6 1 0] 4]]

= [SM 2 [MIN 2 [MAX 20 1 4 20] 0 9] 0 [MIN 1 [MIN 8 6 1 0] 4]]

Next, solve the MIN and MAX operations again:

- For [MIN 6 3 1 2 2 2], the minimum number is 1.
- For [SM 8 0 [MIN 7 1 6 4] [MAX 7 0 2 6]], first calculate [MIN 7 1 6 4] and [MAX 7 0 2 6] which are 1 and 7 respectively. Then, calculate the sum of numbers 8, 0, 1 and 7, which gives 16, and the result mod 10 is 6. 
- For [MIN [MIN 5 6 4 3] 0 2 [MAX 8 1 0 6]], first calculate [MIN 5 6 4 3] and [MAX 8 1 0 6] which are 3 and 8 respectively. Then, the minimum value among 3, 0, 2 and 8 numbers is 0.

Insert those intermediate results back to their places to simplify the expression:

So, the expression is simplified to:

Solve the new expression [SM 0 22 6 4] = SM(0 + 22 + 6 + 4) = SM(32) = 2 (since 32 mod 10 = 2).

Next, [SM 5 6 7 0] = SM(5 + 6 + 7 + 0) = SM(18) = 8.

So, the expression becomes: 
[SM 5 [MIN 2 7 5 8] 5 [MIN 3 [MIN [MAX 5 7 5 1] 0 [SM 8 9 5 3] 2] 5 [MIN [SM 2 9 7 1] 7 3 [SM 9 7 5 3]]]]. 

Next, the expression simplifies as [MIN 2 7 5 8] = MIN(2, 7, 5, 8) = 2.

So, the expression now is:

Now, continue solving the inner expressions:

[MAX 5 7 5 1] = MAX(5, 7, 5, 1) = 7, [SM 8 9 5 3] = SM(8 + 9 + 5 + 3) = SM(25) = 5.
 
So, we get: [SM 5 2 5 [MIN 3 [MIN 7 0 5 2] 5 [MIN [SM 2 9 7 1] 7 3 [SM 9 7 5 3]]]]. 

Next, the inner expression becomes: [MIN 7 0 5 2] = MIN(7, 0, 5, 2) = 0.

So, the expression now is: 
[SM 5 2 5 [MIN 3 0 5 [MIN [SM 2 9 7 1] 7 3 [SM 9 7 5 3]]]]. 

Next, [SM 2 9 7 1] = SM(2 + 9 + 7 +1) = SM(19) = 9, [SM 9 7 5 3] = SM(9 + 7 + 5 + 3) = SM(24) = 4.

So, we get: [SM 5 2 5 [MIN 3 0 5 [MIN 9 7 3 4]]]. 

Again, [MIN 9 7 3 4] = MIN(9, 7, 3, 4) = 3.

[MIN 3 0 5 3] = MIN(3, 0, 5, 3) = 0.

So, the expression now is: [SM 5 2 5 0].

[MAX 6 3 5 5] = 6

The two expressions then become: 
[MIN [SM 3 4 5 1] 6 7 3] and [MAX 9 [MIN 6 9 6 7] 5 [MAX 3 5 7 6]].

Resolving the remaining SM, MAX, and MIN operators:

Now we can insert these results back to our main equation:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify nested operators, working from inner expressions to outer ones:

- [SM 3 8 5 3] = (3+8+5+3) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
- [MAX 5 8 5 3] = 8
- [MAX 9 6 1 7] = 9
- [SM 2 3 2 3] = (2+3+2+3) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0
- [SM 2 9 3 9] = (2+9+3+9) mod 10 = 23 mod 10 = 3
- [MAX 1 7 2 4] = 7
- [SM 9 1 4 0] = (9+1+4+0) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4

Now we have significant simplification:

In the next step, we resolve more deeply nested operators:

- [MAX 6 9 8 9] = 9
- [MIN 6 9 4 8] = 4
- [SM 2 0 5 3] = (2+0+5+3) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0
- [SM 7 1 0 4] = (7+1+0+4) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2

The equation now is simpler:

[MIN 8 9 [MIN 9 0 [MAX 1 1 4 9] 5] [MAX 6 0 5 2]]

We proceed further:

- [MAX 1 1 4 9] = 9

Then we simplify the [MIN] and [MAX] operator that survives:

[MIN 0 [SM 6 [MIN 2 7 2 2] [SM 3 7 0 0] 2]]

MIN 2 7 2 2 will be 2 because 2 is the minimum value.
SM 3 7 0 0 will be 0 because (3 + 7 + 0 + 0) = 10, and 10 modulo 10 equals 0.
The expression then becomes [MIN 0 [SM 6 2 0 2]], which simplifies to [MIN 0 0], because (6 + 2 + 0 + 2) = 10, 10 modulo 10 equals 0.
MIN 0 0 will give us 0, as it is the smaller number.

Next, we'll compute the inner MAX and MIN in the second argument of the outermost MAX:

[MIN 6 [MIN 1 5 3 8] 5 [SM 6 9 2 5]]
MIN 1 5 3 8 equals 1.
SM 6 9 2 5 equals 2 because (6 + 9 + 2 + 5) = 22, and then 22 modulo 10 gives us 2.
This simplifies to [MIN 6 1 5 2], which becomes 1, the smallest value.

The third argument of the outermost MAX is already a single number: 8.

The fourth argument of the outermost MAX is:

[MIN [SM 3 [MAX 9 5 3 6] 1 [SM 1 7 2 9]] 0 1 [MAX [MAX 6 7 6 5] 5 [MIN 5 4 5 8] 0]]

MAX 9 5 3 6 equals 9.
SM 1 7 2 9 equals 9 because (1 + 7 + 2 + 9) = 19 and 19 modulo 10 gives us 9.
MAX 6 7 6 5 equals 7.
MIN 5 4 5 8 equals 4.
The expression then simplifies to [MIN [SM 3 9 1 9] 0 1 [MAX 7 5 4 0]], then to [MIN 2 0 1 7] (after SM and MAX computations), and finally to 0 (which is the minimum value).

In this expression, [MAX 7 6 5 3] = 7 and [MAX 1 0 1 4] = 4. Substituting these values into the original expression we get:

[MIN 2 [MIN 8 7 7 4]

Since the MIN operator selects the smallest value, [MIN 8 7 7 4] = 4. So, the expression now becomes:

[MIN 2 4] which equals 2.

Then, let's solve the expression:

[MAX [SM 0 2 6 7] [MAX 4 9 4 5] 1 9]

The [SM 0 2 6 7] equals to (0+2+6+7) mod 10 = 5 and [MAX 4 9 4 5] = 9, substituting these values into the original expression we get:

[MAX 0 2 6 7] = 7

Substitute these values to get

[SM 3 7 7] = (3+7+7) mod 10 = 7

[MIN 4 2 8 6] = 2

[MAX 6 8 3 8] = 8

Substitute these values to get

[MAX 0 2 7 [MAX 2 2 7 8]] 1

[MAX 2 2 7 8] = 8

Substitute this to get

[MAX 0 2 7 8] 1

Finally, [MAX 0 2 7 8] = 8

The entire expression is now:

  SM 3 5 7 7 -> 3 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 22 (modulo 10) = 2

Our expression now is:

  [MAX 5 [MIN [MAX 6 8 [MAX 5 3 3 8] 3] 1 5 [MIN [MAX 5 8 1 4] [MAX 5 0 5 7] 8 3]] [MIN [MIN 8 5 9 1] 9 0 [MIN 2 2 [MIN 9 1 3 2] 2]] 3]

  MAX 5 8 1 4 -> 8
  MAX 5 0 5 7 -> 7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can solve the operations inside the brackets starting from the innermost brackets.

[MIN 4 7 5 1] = 1
[MAX 4 4 0 1 = 4
[SM 1 8 1 4] = 4 (since 1+8+1+4 = 14 and we take modulo 10) 

Now, we have:

Next step:

[MIN 0 4 8 8] = 0
[MIN 1 8 0 7] = 0
[SM 0 7 0 6] = 3 (since 0+7+0+6 = 13 and we take modulo 10)

The function with new values:

[MAX 5 [MAX 7 4 2 3] 6 [SM 8 [MAX [MAX 0 4 6 4] 2 4 [SM 9 3 1 2]] 2 [MAX [MIN 8 2 0 0] 3 [SM 4 9 2 9] 5]]].

Solution of next steps are:

[MAX 7 4 2 3] = 7
[MAX 0 4 6 4] = 6
[SM 9 3 1 2] = 5 (since 9+3+1+2 = 15 and we take modulo 10)

That gives us:

[MAX 5 7 6 [SM 8 [MAX 6 2 4 5] 2 [MAX [MIN 8 2 0 0] 3 [SM 4 9 2 9] 5]]].

Solve the other brackets:

[MIN 8 2 0 0] = 0
[SM 4 9 2 9] = 4 (since 4+9+2+9 = 24 and we take modulo 10)

We will have the following:

[MAX 5 7 6 [SM 8 [MAX 6 2 4 5] 2 [MAX 0 3 4 5]]].

In another round we get:

[MAX 6 2 4 5] = 6
[MAX 0 3 4 5] = 5

[SM 8 6 2 5] = 1 (since 8+6+2+5 = 21 and we take modulo 10)

- MAX 0 3 1 8 is 8

- MAX 4 1 [MAX 9 0 7 9] [MAX 8 3 8 5] becomes MAX 4 1 9 8 (since both MAX 9 0 7 9 and MAX 8 3 8 5 are 9 and 8 respectively). The result is 9.
- MIN [MAX 4 9 5 9] 0 7 [MAX 7 1 9 1] becomes MIN 9 0 7 9 (as both MAX 4 9 5 9 and MAX 7 1 9 1 are 9). This ultimately gives us 0.

Consequently, the updated equation is:

- MIN [2 7 8 0] [0] 7 5 is MIN 2 0 7 5 which is 0.
- MIN 5 [9] 8 [0] is MIN 5 9 8 0 which is also 0.

For the inner [MIN 6 9 5 3] the minimum number is 3.

For the inner [MAX 6 9 0 9] the maximum number is 9.

For the inner [SM 9 4 2 0] the sum is 9 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 15, mod 10 = 5.

For the inner [SM 7 5 7 6] the sum is 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 25, mod 10 = 5.

[SM 6 1 5 4] means addition of 6, 1, 5, 4 which is 16.
But since it is sum modulo 10, we reduce it by a multiple of 10 to get single-digit which is, 16-10 = 6.

[Max 1 0 1 5] means maximum of 1, 0, 1, 5 which is 5.

[SM 4 2 0 4] returns 0 (because 4+2+0+4 = 10, and 10 modulo 10 equals 0).

Substitute this back into the original expression:

[MIN 9 0] 4 [SM 7 0 [MIN 1 0 9 7] 0] 8

Find the minimum:

[MIN 9 0] returns 0;
[MIN 1 0 9 7] returns 0.

Substitute this back into the original expression:

0 4 [SM 7 0 0 0] 8

Calculate the sum:

[SM 7 0 0 0] returns 7 (because 7+0+0+0 = 7, and 7 modulo 10 equals 7).

Substitute this back into the original expression:

0 4 7 8

From those options, the minimum value is 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.",0,1

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the operations nested within square brackets should be solved first. 

[MIN 8 3 2 6] equals 2, the smallest number in the sequence.
[MAX 1 7 6 1] equals 7, the largest number in the sequence.
[SM 7 0 4 6] equals (7+0+4+6) mod 10, equals 7
[MAX 7 9 1 5] equals 9, the largest number in the sequence.
[MAX 1 9 8 6] equals 9, the largest number in the sequence.
[MIN 1 5 7 9] equals 1, the smallest number in the sequence.
[SM 8 5 5 2] equals (8+5+5+2) mod 10, equals 0.
[SM 8 0 2 4] equals (8+0+2+4) mod 10, equals 4.

Substituting the values back into the original expression:

[MAX [MAX 9 [SM 7 0 2 7] 8 [MAX 5 7 9 1]] 4 [MIN [SM 9 9 9 1] 1 0 [MIN 0 6 0 4]] 1]

Then, [SM 7 0 2 7] equals (7+0+2+7) mod 10, equals 6
[MAX 5 7 9 1] equals 9
[SM 9 9 9 1] equals (9+9+9+1) mod 10, equals 8
[MIN 0 6 0 4] equals 0.

Replace the calculated values back to the expression:

[MAX [MAX 9 6 8 9] 4 [MIN 8 1 0 0] 1]

[MAX 9 6 8 9] equals 9
[MIN 8 1 0 0] equals 0.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve the expressions within the third level of brackets:

- MAX 3 [MAX 7 6 2 1] calculation is MAX 3 7 which results in 7
- SM 8 1 5 7 calculation is (8 + 1 + 5 + 7) modulo 10 which results in 1
- MIN 3 7 7 8 calculation gives 3
- SM 5 3 2 8 calculation is (5 + 3 + 2 + 8) modulo 10 which results in 8
- MAX 4 6 0 1 calculation results in 6
- SM 8 6 7 0 calculation is (8 + 6 + 7 + 0) modulo 10 which results in 1
- MIN 2 4 2 8 calculation gives 2
- MAX 8 5 8 6 calculation results in 8

- MIN [MAX 7 0 1] 3 calculation is MIN 7 3 which results in 3
- SM 6 7 3 8 calculation is (6+7+3+8) modulo 10 which results in 4
- MIN 4 1 1 calculation is 1
- SM 3 1 9 calculation is (3 + 1 + 9) modulo 10 which results in 3
- SM [MIN 2 3 6 8] 3 6 calculation is SM 2 3 6 which is (2+3+6) modulo 10

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's handle the innermost operations:

MAX 0 8 [MAX 9 2 2 6] [MAX 7 2 7 8] = MAX 0 8 9 8 = 9

SM 2 8 7 6 = (2+8+7+6) mod 10 = 23 mod 10 = 3

MIN 2 9 2 8 = 2

So, we have:

MIN [MAX 9] [SM 3 4 2 3] 6 8 = MIN 9 (3+4+2+3) mod 10 6 8 = MIN 9 2 6 8 = 2

Next, MAX 6 [MIN 7 9 2 0] 6 [MIN 5 2 1 7] = MAX 6 0 6 1 = 6

SM 9 2 4 4 = (9+2+4+4) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9

MAX 1 [SM 9] 2 [MAX 4 4 3 5] 6 = MAX 1 9 2 5 6 = 9

So, we have:

MIN [MAX 6] 2 [MAX 9] 1 = MIN 6 2 9 1 = 1

Finally,

MAX [MIN 2] 1 [MIN 1] 1 = MAX 2 1 1 1 = 2
