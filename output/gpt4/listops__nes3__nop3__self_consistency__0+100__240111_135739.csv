- [MIN 1 8 3] = The minimum between 1, 8, 3 is 1, now the expression becomes: [MIN 6 1 [SM 3 6 0]].
- [SM 3 6 0] = 3+ 6 + 0 = 9, but since we are taking sum modulo 10, so it is only 9, and the expression becomes [MIN 6 1 9].

2. ""MAX"" would find the highest value in a list.
3. ""SM"" would sum recursively all the values of a list and if the sum exceeds 10 then it will remove multiples of 10 from it. (Basically, performing a modulo 10 operation).
