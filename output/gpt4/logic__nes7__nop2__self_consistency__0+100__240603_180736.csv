A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should simplify `!F` which is `True` because `not False` is `True`.

Next, `((T&(T&(y|((!F)&T))))` becomes `(T&(T&(y|(True&T))))` which further simplifies to `(T&T&y)`. Since we have `and` operation between True values, the result of their `and` is `True`, so this part reduces to `y`.

For the second part, `((((((c|c)&(F|T))&c)&T)|c)|T)`, start with simplifying `F|T` which gives `True` (since at least one of `False` or `True` is `True`). Now, `((c|c)&(True))&c)&T` simplifies to `(c&c)&T`, which further simplifies to `c&T`. Also, `(c&T)|c` includes one `or` operation between similar values or values that include each other. So, `(c&T)|c` is `c`.

Next, `(c|T)` simplifies to `True` since `or` operation between any value and `True` is `True`.

2. Applying these rules, we get:

5. Substitute these back in:

`(s & ((T & (d & F)) | F ) & ((T | !F) |  T))+ (T & (T & F)) & (F &T)`

Let's denote `T` as True and `F` as False.

Firstly, we can simplify it into the following form:
1. `T & (d & F)` will simplify to `T & F` because `d & F = F` (anything ANDed with False is always False).
    
2. So if `F` again ANDed with `T`, then we will get `F` (from step 1).
   
3. `(T | !F) | T` will simplify to `T | T | T` because `!F = T` (not False is True). 

4. Hence, `T | T | T = T`, and `F & T = F`.

5. `((T & (d & F)) | F)` will simplify to `F | F = F` because in first bracket `(T &  (d & F))` becomes `F` from step 1. 

6. `(s & (F & T))`. Substituting `(F & T)` with `F`, this reduces to `s & F` (from step 2). 

7. `T & (T & F)` reduces to `T & F = F`.
 
8. `F & T = F`.

2. Anything OR (|) with False returns the initial value if it is true, else it becomes False. So, ((True OR False)) is simplified to T.
3. The double negation (!!F) simply negates the negation, leaving the original value. So, !!F is simplified to F.

- (!F) equates to T.

1. Simplify 'T&T' to T, because True and True is always True. The expression becomes:

2. Simplify 'T&(s&F)' to F, because any value and False is always False. It becomes:
   (((k|(T&F))&T)&F)|(F&(!(!(!F)))).

3. Further simplify 'T&F' to F. It turns into:
   (((k|F)&T)&F)|(F&(!(!(!F)))).

4. Then replace 'k|F' with k, because any value or False is that value itself. Now it is:
   ((k&T)&F)|(F&(!(!(!F)))).

5. Reduce 'k&T' to k, because any value and True is that value. You get:
   (k&F)|(F&(!(!(!F)))).

6. Simplify 'k&F' to F, because any value and False is always False. You obtain:
   F|(F&(!(!(!F)))).

7. Simplify '(!(!(!F)))' as follows: 
   Not-Not-Not-False = Not-Not-True = Not-True = False. 

Replace it in expression:
   F|(F&F).

8. Finally, you simplify 'F&F' to F. So, the end formula is:

3. !F would be true since the not operator inverts the value.

    - Resolve ((T|(!(F|T)))), F|T means False or True, It is always True(T). So, we can ignore this 'or' statement, as anything or'd with True will be always True. T|T equals True(T).
2. Now, Simplify the derived values,
    - The expression now simplifies to ((F)|((F&(T&(F))&(T)))).

((!(F|F))&(!((T|(o|T))|(F|((F|(T|T))|((F|T)&F)))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula can be simplified as follows:

First, understand the semantics:

'&' means both conditions must be True to yield True (logical AND)
'|' means either condition must be True to yield True (logical OR)
'!' means the opposite of the following condition (logical NOT)

Next, simplify the formula step by step:

Step 1: Simplify the first part:
(!(F|F)) -- In this, F|F = False OR False = False, so the expression simplifies to !(False), i.e., not False, which is True.

Step 2: Simplify the second part of the formula:
(!((T|(o|T))|(F|((F|(T|T))|((F|T)&F)))))
First, resolve all the | and & operations that don’t involve 'o':

T|(o|T) = T because T OR anything is True
F|(T|T) = F|True = True
(F|T)&F = True&F = False

Substitute these results back in your formula to get:

(!((T)|((F)|((True)|False))))
Replace True and False with their respective values T and F:

(!((T)|(F|(T|F))))
Since, T OR anything is T and F OR anything is that thing:

(!(T|T))
Which is equivalent to:

!(T)
As anything with logical NOT will be the opposite, so the simplified result for this part is False.

So final simplified result of the formula is:

((!(F|F))&(!((T|(o|T))|(F|((F|(T|T))|((F|T)&F))))))

Then, let's simplify the next operation:
- T&F is equivalent to F.
- So, !(T&F) equals !F, which is T.

Then, we can simplify the remaining formulas:
- ((n&F)|F) which is the same as saying (F|F), is F because False or False is False.

- !((!(T&(!F)))|(o|(c|(((n&F)|F)|(T&F))))) equals !(F|T), which results in !T because True or False is always True.

In the first parenthesis, F | (!T) equals F | F, which reduces to F, thus k | (F | (!T)) equals k | F, which reduces to k.

Secondly, T|F equals T, T|T equals T, and g&(!T) equals g&F, which reduces to F. Thus, ((T|F)|F)|(g&(!T)) equals T|F which reduces to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplifying the innermost brackets:

T|F --> T, because the logical 'or' (|) of True (T) with any value is always True (T).

F|F --> F, because the logical 'or' (|) of False (F) with another False (F) remains False (F).

So, the expression simplifies to:

(((((a&(m|T))&a)&((!(F)|T)|T))|a)&((T&T)&F))

Then, m|T --> T, because 'or' (|) of any value with T is T.

and, T&T --> T, because logical 'and' (&) of True with True is True.

So, we get:

(((((a&T)&a)&((!F)|T)|T))|a)&(T&F))

a&T --> a, because 'and' (&) with T does not change the variable.

a&a --> a, because 'and' (&) with self doesn't change the variable.

and, T|T --> T, because 'or' (|) with self doesn't change the variable.

So it simplifies to:

((a&(T)|T))|a)&(T&F)

a&T --> a, because 'and' (&) with T does not change the variable. 

So, the expression simplifies to:

((a|T))|a)&(T&F)

a|T --> T, because 'or' (|) with T is T.

T&F --> F, because the logical 'and' (&) between True and False results in False.

So, the original equation simplifies to:

T|a --> T, because logical 'or' (|) with true is always True.

Finally, the expression simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify F|(!(T&T)). We know that T&T is always T, so !(T&T) will be the negation of T, which is F. F|F will obviously be F.
So our formula becomes ((((j|((j&T)|(T&F)))|j)|F)&j)&!F), where !F is T because F represents False, and the inversion of False is True.

Next, T&F turns to F because the statement ""True and False"" is False. So, our formula is ((((j|((j&T)|F))|j)|F)&j)&T).

The statement j&T returns j because the statement ""j and True"" is always as true as j itself. Therefore, we can simplify ((((j|((j&T)|F))|j)|F)&j)&T) to ((((j|j)|j)|F)&j)&T).

The logical or operator | is associative, meaning j|j|j is equivalent to (j|j)|j or j|(j|j). In both cases, the operation will return j, so we can simplify ((((j|j)|j)|F)&j)&T) to ((j|F)&j)&T.

j|F will yield j because ""j or False"" is always as true as j itself. ((j|F)&j)&T turns into (j&j)&T.

Again, if j is true, then j&j will also be true, and if j is false, so it's result is j. Therefore, we can simplify (j&j)&T to j&T.

- !T equals F (Not True equals False)

- T|T equals T (Anything or True equals True)

- w&F equals F (Anything and False equals False)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the operation ¨T or F¨ can be simplified: any value (True/False) or true is always true (T).

This yields: 

(((t&((t|((T)&(t&F)))|(t|(t|F))))|F)&(((g|F)|g)|T)).

We know that any value logically AND with false is always false. Therefore, (t&F) will always be false (F), and we can also simplify that:

(((t&((t|(T)&(F)))|(t|(t|F))))|F)&(((g|F)|g)|T)).

Then, we also know that anything or false is just the initial anything. So, we simplify (t|(T)&(F)) and (g|F) becomes g:

(((t&((t|T)|t))|F)&(g|T)).

Any value or with True will result always True, this we can simplify (t|T) to T:

((t&(T)|t)|F)&(g|T));

Again, any value AND with True will result always in the initial value, so we simplify t&T to t:

(t|t|F)&(g|T).

Any value or with itself is the value itself, (t | t) simplifies to t:

(t|F)&(g|T).

Also, the expression ""something or false"" is equals to ""something"" so we simplify (t|F) to t and we end up with:

t&(g|T).

As we have mentioned before, anything or true is always true so g|T becomes T:

t&T.

And any value AND with True will result always in the initial value, so we simplify t&T to t. So, the simplified equation is:

Finally, you have (n | F), which simplifies to n. So the entire formula simplifies to n.",n,n

((F|(F&(F|T)))&(F&(!((((F|F)|T)&F)&(F|(F|(T|T))))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Let's deal with the inner parentheses first. (F|T) will be True, and (T|T) also will be True. Hence, (F|(F|(T|T))) becomes (F|F|True), which is True.
2. ((F|F)|T) also results in True. Thus, (((F|F)|T)&F) becomes (True&F), which results in False.
3. Therefore, the entire expression within the large parentheses becomes (F&(!False)), which is equivalent to (F&True). Because F and True is F only.
4. (F|(F&True)) simplifies to (F|F), which is False.
5. Therefore, the whole initial expression simplifies to False.",F,F
99,logic,self_consistency,(((((w|((w|F)&T))|w)|(w&(w&((w|w)|w))))&T)|(F|(T&T))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively.

(((((w|((w|F)&T))|w)|(w&(w&((w|w)|w))))&T)|(F|(T&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, any value ORed with False (w|F) remains that value (w), any value ANDed with True (w&T) remains that value (w).

Second, similarly, any value ORed with itself remains that value (w|w=w), any value ANDed with itself remains that value (w&w=w).

Then, let's also remember that any value ORed with True is always True (w|T=T), and False ORed with True is True (F|T=T).

Applying this to your formula:

(((((w|((w|F)&T))|w)|(w&(w&((w|w)|w))))&T)|(F|(T&T)))

Simplifies to:

((((w|(w&T))|w)|(w&(w&(w|w))))&T)|(F|T)

Then to:

(((w|w)|w)|(w&w))|T

Then to:

(w|w)|T

Then to:

w|T

And finally to:

T

Therefore, the simplification of your logic formula is the value True (T).",T,T
