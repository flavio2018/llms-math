[MAX 9 6 7] gives us 9. [SM 3 1 3] gives us 7 (because 3+1+3 = 7). [MAX 2 8 5] gives us 8. [MAX 6 8 8] gives us 8. [MAX 5 1 0] gives us 5.

Becomes

Further simplifying the second layer of instructions inside brackets gives:

- [MAX [MIN 7 8 5] [MIN 2 2 8] 4] = [MAX 5 2 4] = 5

Substitute these values again to solve the remaining two [MAX] expressions:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the value inside the innermost brackets.  

[MIN 0 9 9] is 0 since the minimum value among 0, 9, and 9 is 0.  
[MAX 4 1 8] is 8 since the maximum value among 4, 1, and 8 is 8.  
The first part of the expression now reduces to:  

[MIN [MAX 0 8] 8 [MIN [MIN 0 6 6] [MIN 2 1 2] 7] 7] 2 [MAX [MAX 1 [MAX 6 7 0] [SM 8 8 2]] [MIN [MIN 9 2 6] 8 [SM 2 4 6]] 2]  

The sum modulo 10, [SM 8 8 2], is calculated as: (8 + 8 + 2) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8.

Go on evaluating inner bracket expressions:  

[MAX 0 8] outputs 8, [MIN 0 6 6] results in 0 and [MIN 2 1 2] gives 1.  
So, we have:  

[MIN 8 8 [MIN 0 1 7] 7] 2 [MAX [MAX 1 [MAX 6 7 0] 8] [MIN [MIN 9 2 6] 8 [SM 2 4 6]] 2]

[MIN 8 8 0 7] 2 [MAX [MAX 1 [MAX 6 7 0] 8] [MIN [MIN 9 2 6] 8 [SM 2 4 6]] 2]  

Next, [MIN 9 2 6] is computed as 2, [SM 2 4 6] results in (2+4+6) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 =2, and [MAX 6 7 0] outputs 7. Our expression is now:

[MIN 8 8 0 7] 2 [MAX [MAX 1 7 8] [MIN 2 8 2] 2]  

Calculate the inner brackets:  

[MIN 8 8 0 7] becomes 0, and for the second part, [MAX 1 7 8] becomes 8, [MIN 2 8 2] becomes 2. So, the expression is now:  

0 2 [MAX 8 2 2]  

Calculating [MAX 8 2 2] as 8, the expression finally comes down to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to calculate the expressions inside each MIN, MAX and SM.

MIN 8 9 8: the minimum here is 8.

MIN 9 4 0: the minimum here is 0.

SM [MAX [MIN 8 9 8] 1 [MIN 9 4 0]]: here we first need to find the MAX, which is 8. Then we sum modulo 10 this value with itself plus 1, which gives us: (8 + 1) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9.

Now let's move on to the second part of the SM function:

MIN 3 6 1: the minimum here is 1.

MAX 9 6 2: the maximum here is 9.

Then MAX [MIN 3 6 1] [MAX 9 6 2] 8 is MAX 1 9 8, which is 9.

Hence, SM [MAX [MIN 8 9 8] 1 [MIN 9 4 0]] [MAX [MIN 3 6 1] [MAX 9 6 2] 8] 6: (9 + 9 + 6) mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4.

Let's calculate the expression inside the brackets:

MIN 5 9 5: the minimum here is 5.

SM 9 1 6: (9 + 1 + 6) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6.

Then MIN 4 [MIN 5 9 5] [SM 9 1 6] is MIN 4 5 6: the minimum here is 4.

Next, MIN 3 3 3 is 3.

Then SM 6 [MIN 3 3 3] [SM 2 5 0] is (6 + 3 + 7) mod 10 = 16 mod 10 = 6.

Finally, MAX [MIN 4 [MIN 5 9 5] [SM 9 1 6]] 9 [SM 6 [MIN 3 3 3] [SM 2 5 0]] is MAX 4 9 6: the maximum here is 9.

So, the final result is MAX [SM [MAX [MIN 8 9 8] 1 [MIN 9 4 0]] [MAX [MIN 3 6 1] [MAX 9 6 2] 8] 6] 2 [MAX [MIN 4 [MIN 5 9 5] [SM 9 1 6]] 9 [SM 6 [MIN 3 3 3] [SM 2 5 0]]], which is MAX 4 2 9. Hence, the maximum is 9.",9,9

The expression is now:

Simplify:

* Inner SM Operations:
  - [SM 4 9 7] => 4 + 9 + 7 = 20 but as it's 'sum modulo 10', the value will actually be 20 % 10 = 0
  - [SM 3 4 0] => 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 % 10 = 7
  - [SM 0 7 8] => 0 + 7 + 8 = 15 % 10 = 5
  - [SM 7 1 6] => 7 + 1 + 6 = 14 % 10 = 4
  - [SM [MIN 4 2 8] 0 [MIN 7 1 0]] => The MIN operations inside the SM need to be solved first: [MIN 4 2 8] = 2; [MIN 7 1 0] = 0. Then, we do the SM operation: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2.
  - [SM 2 1 7] => 2 + 1 + 7 = 10 % 10 = 0

* Inner MIN Operations:
  - [MIN [SM 4 9 7] [SM 3 4 0] 3] => We've solved these SM operations above, so we substitute those values here: [MIN 0 7 3] = 0
  - [MIN 6 [SM [MIN 4 2 8] 0 [MIN 7 1 0]] [MIN [SM 2 1 7] 8 [MAX 0 1 4]]] => we've solved SM and MAX operations above, so we substitute those values here: [MIN 6 2 [MIN 0 8 4]] => clear the inner MIN: [MIN 6 2 0] = 0

* Inner MAX Operations:
  - [MAX 4 [SM 0 7 8] [SM 7 1 6]] => with the solutions from SM operations above: [MAX 4 5 4] = 5
  - [MAX 0 1 4] => The maximum is 4

The maximum numbers between 3, 1, 7, 1, 5, 6, and 8, 8, 0 are 7, 6, and 8, respectively, so we will replace [MAX 3 1 7] with 7, [MAX 1 5 6] with 6, [MAX 8 8 0] with 8. 

This results in: 

[SM [MIN [MAX 9 1 [SM 5 0 8]] 4 [SM 7 5 [SM 7 4 9]]] 9 [MAX 6 [MIN 7 6 1] [MIN [MIN 0 2 0] 8 7]]].

Second, we will work on the MIN functions. The smallest numbers between 9, 1, and a result of [SM 5 0 8] which is (5+0+8) modulo 10 = 3 are 1. The smallest numbers in (0, 2, 0) and (1, 5, 4) are 0 and 1, respectively. 

Our equation is now:

[SM [MIN 9 1 3] 4 [SM 7 5 [SM 7 4 9]] 9 [MAX 6 [MIN 7 6 1] [MIN 0 8 7]]].

Keep going with the MIN functions. The smallest number between 1, 3, and 4 is 1; the smallest number between 7, 6, 1 is 1; the smallest number between 0, 8, and 7 is 0. 

We get: 

[SM 1 [SM 7 5 [SM 7 4 9]] 9 [MAX 6 1 0]].

Let's now solve the second last set of SM functions. The sum of 7, 5, (7+4+9 (which is 20 modulo 10, so 0)), is (7+5+0) modulo 10 = 2. 

This results in: 

[SM 1 2 9 [MAX 6 1 0]].

Finally, solving MAX function between 6, 1, and 0, which is 6 and the main SM function, we have:

- [SM 5 6 9] is (5+6+9) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0.
- [MAX 4 0 0] is 4.

Next steps:

- [SM 2 4 4] is (2+4+4) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0.
- [MAX 0 0 4] is 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's calculate values inside the most inward brackets:

MIN 7 4 1 = 1, SM 7 9 5 = 21, but since we are considering modulo 10, it will be 1.
SM 2 7 7 = 16, in modulo 10 - 6, SM 5 7 3 = 15, in modulo 10 - 5.

MIN 2 1 5 = 1, SM 0 6 4 = 10, in modulo 10 - 0.
MIN 2 5 5 = 2, MAX 4 5 9 = 9.

Now we substitute these obtained results back to the main expression:

MIN 2 9 7 = 2.

Substitute these values back:

[SM [SM 9 3 5] [SM 0 5 9] 0] = [SM 7 4 0] = (7+4) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1.

Next, we will perform the MIN and MAX calculations:

[SM [MAX [MAX 0 8 3] 0 [MIN 4 0 8]] 0 [MIN 0 [MIN 6 4 4] [MAX 2 1 2]]]

Here,
[MAX 0 8 3] = 8 (since 8 is the maximum number among 0, 8, 3)

[MIN 4 0 8] = 0 (since 0 is the minimum number among 4, 0, 8)

[MAX [MAX 0 8 3] 0 [MIN 4 0 8]] = 8 (since 8 is the maximum number among 8, 0, 0)

[MIN 6 4 4] = 4 (since 4 is the minimum number among 6, 4, 4)

[MAX 2 1 2] = 2 (since 2 is the maximum number among 2, 1, 2)

[MIN 0 [MIN 6 4 4] [MAX 2 1 2]] = 0 (since 0 is the minimum number among 0, 4, 2)

[SM [MAX [MAX 0 8 3] 0 [MIN 4 0 8]] 0 [MIN 0 [MIN 6 4 4] [MAX 2 1 2]]] = 8 (SM takes the sum modulo 10, so the operation results in 8 (8+0+0) mod 10)

Now, moving onto the next bracket:

[SM [SM [MIN 0 6 2] 2 [MIN 2 6 6]] 8 [SM 9 [MAX 2 5 7] [SM 7 1 0]]]

Here,

[MIN 0 6 2] = 0 (since 0 is the minimum number among 0, 6, 2)

[MIN 2 6 6] = 2 (since 2 is the minimum number among 2, 6, 6)

[SM [MIN 0 6 2] 2 [MIN 2 6 6]] = 4 (0+2+2 = 4)

[MAX 2 5 7] = 7 (since 7 is the maximum number among 2, 5, 7)

[SM 7 1 0] = 8 (SM takes the sum modulo 10, so the operation results in 8 (7+1+0) mod 10)

[SM 9 [MAX 2 5 7] [SM 7 1 0]] = 6 (9+7+8 = 24 mod 10 gives 4)

[SM [SM [MIN 0 6 2] 2 [MIN 2 6 6]] 8 [SM 9 [MAX 2 5 7] [SM 7 1 0]]] = 8 (4+8+4 = 16 mod 10 gives 6)

Sum of 4, 9, 8, modulo 10 is 1.
So, the expression is transformed to [MIN [MIN [SM 2 2 5] 3 [MAX 0 3 5]] 3 [MAX 1 [MAX 6 2 6] [MIN 5 1 7]]]

2. Next, we need to solve remaining [SM 2 2 5], which is 9. Also, [MIN 5 1 7] is 1.
So, the expression looks like [MIN [MIN 9 3 [MAX 0 3 5]] 3 [MAX 1 [MAX 6 2 6] 1]]
