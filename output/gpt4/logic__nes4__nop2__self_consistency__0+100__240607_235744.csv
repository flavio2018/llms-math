Similarly, anything AND'ed with True is itself. So T&T = T. Therefore (((!F)|T)&T)) = T

Next, take F|T ; since T = True and anything OR'ed with True is True, we have F|T = T. Negating this, we get !T = F.

Finally, anything AND'ed with False is False. So, F&T = F. 

Plug these back into the overall equation, ((!(F|T))&T) becomes F.
