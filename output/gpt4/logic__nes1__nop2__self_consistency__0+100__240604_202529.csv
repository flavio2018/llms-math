0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The 'h' can either be true or false. If 'h' is true, then the whole expression is true as per the definition of logical or (T | T = T, T | F = T). But even if 'h' is false, the whole expression is still true, because 'T' makes it true (F | T = T). 

So no matter what value 'h' has, the whole expression (h|T) simplifies to 'T' or True.",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The 'or' operator (denoted as |) gives True if either or both of the operands are true.

Here, one of the operand is True (T). So the result will always be True (T) regardless of the other operand. Hence, the simplified form is T.",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The & symbol means ""and"". In logic, ""and"" is only true if both values are true. The truth value T is always true. So, if we have (v & T), then this is true if v is true, and false if v is false. 

So, the simplified logic formula would simply be: v",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The ""|"" symbol stands for ""or"". So o|F means either ""o"" is true or ""F"" is true. Since ""F"" always stands for false, this will only be true if ""o"" is true. Hence, the simplification is just ""o"".",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (q|F) simplifies to just q. This is because according to the rules of logical OR operation, any variable OR False equals to the variable itself. This is also known as the identity law in Boolean algebra.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The AND operation (&) results in True only if both operands are True. Given that F represents False, (f&F) will always result in False, regardless of the value of f. 
Therefore, the simplified logic formula is F.",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The result of logical and (&) operation between two identical values is the value itself. Therefore, the simplified version of this logic formula (w&w) would be just 'w'.",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The value of ""b"" in the expression ""b|F"" is irrelevant, because anything combined with ""False"" using the OR operator (|) always evaluates to the original value. Therefore, (b|F) simplifies to b.",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The given logic formula is (o|o), that means, it is ""o OR o"". 

Here ""OR"" operation specifies that if any one of the operands (values) is true, then the result is true. 

So, o OR o would simply result in o. Hence the simplified form of the given logic formula is: o.",o,o
