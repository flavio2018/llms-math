- !T can be transformed to F
- !F can be transformed to T
- F&X can be transformed to F 
- T&X can be transformed to X
- F|X can be transformed to X
- T|X can be transformed to T

Applying these transformations, we get:

Simplified to:

3) !F = T;
4) !T = F;
5) F|F = F;
6) T|T = T;
7) T&T = T;
8) T|anything = T (because in an OR relationship, if even one value is True, the whole expression is True);
9) F&anything = F (because in an AND relationship, if even one value is False, the whole expression is False).

3) (F&F) becomes F;
4) (T|T) becomes T;
5) (T|F) becomes T;
6) (F&T) becomes F;

8) (d|T) becomes T.

Substituting these into the equation:

Then we have `(T|F)&F`, which simplifies to `True&F` and gives `False`. And we have `b&T` which we will keep as is, because `b` can be either `True` or `False`. Then we have `T&T` which is `True`. So, `(b&T)&(T&T)` simplifies to `b&True`, which is the same as `b`.

Then, we have `!T` which means ""not true"", which gives `False`. Thus, `(b&True)&(!T)` leads to `b&False` which is `False`.

Then we have `(!T)&F` which means ""not true and False"", and it simplifies to `False&False` which is `False`. So, all the terms associated with `&` or `and` simplify to `False`

First step:
((z&(!(F&(!f&F)&T))&F))|(!(F|(l&T)))

Next simplify operations with T or F values:

For any value p, p|F = p -> in our case, p=l
For any value p, p&F = F -> in our case, p=whole formula inside the parenthesis

((m|((((((e|F)|T)&F)|F)|T))&(((i&(!((F|(m&((((u&u)|(F&T))&(!T))&F)))&T)))&T)&F)).

2. Since any term or'd with F or T becomes T, e|F|T, also simplifies to T, and T&F becomes F, so ((((e|F)|T)&F)|F)|T simplifies to F|F|T which becomes T. The formula is now:
((m|T)&(((i&(!((F|(m&((((u&u)|(F&T))&(!T))&F)))&T)))&T)&F)).

3. The section (((u&u)|(F&T))&(!T))&F also simplifies. Here, u&u is just u, F&T simplifies to F, and !T is F. The section converts to (u|F)&F which again simplifies to F&F which is F. Thus, m&F, which is F. (F|(F&T)), simplifies to F. The formula is now:
((m|T)&((i&(!F)&T)&F)).

4. (i&(!F)&T) becomes (i&T), since !F is T. The formula is now:
((m|T)&((i&T)&F)).

5. (i&T) is equivalent to i, so we have:
((m|T)&(i&F)).

6. i&F will be F, so finally, the formula is:
(m|T)&F.

7. Any term ANDed with F will become F, so the final simplest form of the equation will be:

4. The expression (((i|(i&(i|i)))|T)|F) also simplifies to T since it contains the term '|T' which as we know ""variable OR True"" always evaluates to True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we have to understand some basic truths:

1. `F&X=F`, because False AND anything else is always False.
2. `X&F=F`, because anything AND False is always False. 
3. `T&X=X`, because True AND anything else is always that thing.
4. `X&T=X`, because anything AND True is always that thing. 
5. `F|X=X`, because False OR anything else is always that thing.
6. `X|F=X`, because anything OR False is always that thing.
7. `T|X=T`, because True OR anything else is always True.
8. `X|T=T`, because anything OR True is always True.
9. `!T=F`, because NOT True is False.
10. `!F=T`, because NOT False is True.

So applying these rules:

((F&((F&(p&F))&T))&(T|(F|(((n|F)|((((n|(((F&T)|F)|(!(F|T))))|(n|(F|F)))&(b|T))&(!F)))&F))))

This simplifies to:

((F&((F&F)&T))&(T|(F|(((n|F)|((((n|F)|F)|(!F))&(b|T))&(!F))&F))))

This simplifies to:

((F&(F&T))&(T|((n|F)&(F&(b|T))&(!F)))) &F 

This simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, you see T|F. This implies 'True or False', which is always true. So, you can simplify that to T.

Next, there is T|(F|T). Again, since 'True or anything' always results in true, you can simplify that to T.

Then you see ((n|T)|T), which simplifies to T, because 'any value or True' always equals True.

Also, on simplifying !(F&T) and !(T), this equals to T and F respectively, because the 'not' operator inverses the value.

You now have the following expression:
(T&(!(T)&F) & T)

The expression can be further simplified. T&F equals F, because 'True and False' is False.

Then, you are left with T&!T, which equals F, because 'True and Not True', i.e., 'True and False' is False. 

So, the simplified version of the given logic formula is F.",F,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's evaluate the expressions where we have the true or false value directly.

We know that:
1. X & F = F (anything AND with false is False)
2. X | F = X (anything OR with false is itself)
3. X | T = T (anything OR with true is True)
4. X & T = X (anything AND with true is itself)
5. !F = T (NOT false is True)
6. !T = F (NOT true is False)

Through these rules, we can find:
(((((c&T&(!(f|(!w|T)))&F)&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&(!(!(!(z&T&F))))))
This simplifies to:
((((c&T&(!f&!w)&F)&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&(!(!(!F))))))
F simplifies to:
((((c&(!f&!w)&F)&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&(!T))))
The logic formulas are simplified into:
(((c&F)&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&!T)))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify parts of the expression according to the following logic rules:
- & with T does not change anything.
- | with F does not change anything.
- | with T changes everything to T.
- & with F changes everything to F.
- !F turns into T and !T turns into F.

With that, we can simplify the given logic formula:

((((((v&T)&v)|(!((!(((((e&T)|(T|T))|F)|F)|(!((T&T)&F))))|((c&F)&T))))&F)&F)&(!(F|(!F)))).

First, simplify (((((e&T)|(T|T))|F)|F)|(!((T&T)&F)))) as follows:
- (T|T) simplifies to T.
- (((e&T)|T)|F) simplifies to T because anything | with T is T.
- (!((T&T)&F)) simplifies to T because (T&T)&F simplifies to F and !F turns into T.
- (!T) simplifies to F because !T turns into F.

So, the simplified expression is (((((v&T)&v)|F)|((c&F)&T)))&F)&(!(F|(!F))).

Next, simplify (((((v&T)&v)|F)|((c&F)&T)))&F) to F because & with F changes everything to F.

So, the simplified expression is F&(!(F|(!F))).

Finally, simplify F&(!(F|(!F))) as follows:
- (F|(!F)) simplifies to T because (F|T) is T and !T turns into F.
- F&(!T) simplifies to F because F & anything is F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we remember that `F` is False and `T` is True.

`F & anything = F`, since the logical `and` of False and anything is False. 
`T & anything = anything`, since the logical `and` of True and anything is always whatever the other thing is.
`F | anything = anything`, since the logical `or` of False and anything is always whatever the other thing is.
`T | anything = T`, since the logical `or` of True and anything is always True.
This is according to the truth tables of logical `and` and `or`.

Finally, `!F` is True and `!T` is False, as per the laws of negation.

Using these laws, we can simplify your formula.

In your formula, wherever you have `F | F`, `F & F`, `F | T`, `F & T`, `T & T`, or `T | T`, you can simplify it based on the above rules.

Let's simplify the formula:

`((F|(c|(F|(!(((z|(((t&F)|F)&F))&F)|(T&(((((F|F)&(T&T))|F)&T)|F)))))))|((d|(j|(T&(!F))))&T))`
= `(c|(!((z|(t&F|F)&F|(T&((F&F|(T&T)|F)&T)|F)))))|((d|(j|T))&T)`

Using the law `t&F|F = F`:

= `(c|(!((z|F|(T&F))))|((d|(j|T))&T))`

Using the law `T&F = F`:

= `(c|(!((z|F|F)))|((d|(j|T))&T))`

= `(c|(!z))|((d|j)&T)`

Using the law `d|j&T = (d&T|j&T)`:

= `(c|(!z))|(d&T|j&T)`

Using the law `d&T = d`:

= `(c|(!z))|(d|j)`

3. !X&Y = X&!Y and X&Y = X , where X,Y is an arbitrary statement. Hence, the given logic formula can be simplified to:

6. The expression ((X|Y)&Z) = (X&Z)|(Y&Z), where X,Y is an arbitrary statement. Hence, the given logic formula can be simplified to:

- T | T => T (True OR True is True)
- F&F => F (False AND False is False)

- !F => T (NOT False is True)

Then, simplify the expression using properties of mathematical logic:
- From i | F, we get i (X OR False = X)
- From i & i, we get i (X AND X = X)
- From z | T, we get T (X OR True = True)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, start by simplifying the simplest sub-expressions. Since a value and-ed, or-ed, or not-ed with something represents the other value itself, 
    (n|F) becomes n, and 
    (F&n) becomes F.
 
2. Similarly, 
    (T&n) becomes n,
    (n&F) becomes F, and 
    (n&T) becomes n.

3. To simplify (h|(((F|(((o&((o&o)&T))&F)&T))&T)|(!((F|(F&((((F|(F|F))|((F|F)&T))&T)&T)))|F)))), let's break it down:

    (a) (o&o) results in o. Hence, o&((o&o)&T) simplifies to o&(o&T) -> o&o due to (2) -> o.

    (b) (n|F) results in n. Hence, ((n&F)&T)) | n becomes F|n -> n.

    (c) (F|(F&n)), again, is simplified to F due to (b) resulting in F. Therefore, (!n)|F simplifies to !n.

4. Hence, the expression (((n|F)&n)&(h|(((F|(((o&((o&o)&T))&F)&T))&T)|(!((F|(F&((((F|(F|F))|((F|F)&T))&T)&T)))|F))))) simplifies as follows:

   First, ((n|F)&n) simplifies to n&n -> n due to (a).

   Second, (h|(n|(F&n))) simplifies to (h|(n|F)) -> h|n due to (b), and the expression becomes n & (h|n).

   If n is True, this expression simplifies as T & (h|T) -> T & T -> T.

   If n is False, the expression simplifies as F & (h|F) -> F & h -> F.

That gives us:
true & ((a | false | a & true & f) & false)
Because true or false will always give true and true and false will always give false.

Step 2: Further simplifying:
true & (a | f)

3. Also, any logic formula, `p & T` is equivalent to `p` and `!T` equivalent to `F`. 
4. Logically, `F & statement` will always be `F` and `(F|statement)` will be simplified to `statement`.

3. Consider the expression (x|x), this is essentially a comparison between x and itself, which will certainly result in True. Therefore, (F&True) will return F. Similarly, (p&True) will return p. So we can remove all instances of ""&T"" from our expression.

Anything & F and anything | T can be simplified as F and T, respectively. The negation ! will shift F to T and vice versa, and T|F can be simply put as T:

Accordingly:
((T&(T|((g&F)|F)))&((!(((e|((l&F)|F)|(F|(T&T)))&F))&F))&T))

Step 2: 
Anything & F is equal to F, and anything & T and anything | T equal itself and T, respectively:

((T & T) & (!F & F) & T))

Step 3: 
Now, !F is equivalent to T, and anything & F is F:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. For any literals m, ""(m | T)"" always simplify to True (T) because ORing any value with True always returns True.

2. Likewise, ""(d | T)"" and ""(x | T)"" both simplify to True because ORing any value with True always returns True.

3. ""(T & T)"" simply becomes True, ""(F & F)"" becomes False, and ""(F | F)"" becomes False, because ANDing or ORing the same values returns the same value.

4. Negating True (!T) results in False (F).

5. Any value ANDed with False ""(F & m)"" or ""(m & F)"" always results in False.

6. Any value ORed with False ""(F | m)"" or ""(m | F)"" always results in the literal itself (m).

7. Similarly, any value ANDed with True ""(T & m)"" or ""(m & T)"" always results in the literal itself (m).

8. The innermost part of the formula simplifies as follows:

   ""(F & (F & F)) | F"" -> ""F | F"" -> ""F"".

   ""T & (((T & T) & F) & T & ((x | T) | (F | F))) | (!T))"" -> ""T & ((T & F) & T & T | F) | F"" -> ""T & (F & T & T | F) | F"" -> ""T & F | F"" -> ""F | F"" -> ""F"".

9. Applying this to the next level, the formula simplifies to:

   ""T"" - from step 1.
   
   ""F | ( T & (F & ((u & F) & F)))"" - substitute step 8 here -> ""F | (T & (F & F))"" -> ""F | (T & F)"" -> ""F | F"" -> ""F"".

10. Finally, the whole formula simplifies to ""T & F"" which is False. So, the simplified form is False (F).",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that ""F"" means False and ""T"" means True. 
Now, ""T|"" means True OR anything which always results in True. 
Similarly, ""F&"" means False AND anything which always results in False. 
Along with these, we know ""T&"" and ""|T"" are identity operations, they have no effect on the operation since True AND anything equals anything, and anything OR True equals True. 

Now, let's simplify the given formula step by step:

    ((F|(l|((((F&(!(((!F)|F)&T)))|(T&((v&(((T&F)|(T|T))&T))|T)))|T)|T)))&(b&(T&((F&(F&F))&T))).

First, we simplify (((!F)|F)&T) to T, since not False OR False is always True AND True which results in True. 

So the expression then becomes:

    ((F|(l|((((F&(!T)))|(T&((v&(((T&F)|(T|T))&T))|T)))|T)|T)))&(b&(T&((F&(F&F))&T))).

Next, we simplify T&F as F, and T|T as T, so the above formula becomes:

    ((F|(l|((((F&(!T)))|(T&((v&((F|T)&T))|T)))|T)|T)))&(b&(T&((F&(F&F))&T))).

We simplify (F|T) as T and, (F&F) as F, then the expression becomes:

    ((F|(l|((((F&(!T)))|(T&((v&(T&T))|T)))|T)|T)))&(b&(T&((F&T))).

And we simplify (!T) as F, T&T as T and F&T as F:

    ((F|(l|((((F&F)))|(T&((v&T)|T)))|T)|T)))&(b&(T&F)).

Then, we simplify (F&F) as F, (v&T) as v, (T|T) as T and (T&F) as F:

    ((F|(l|((F)|(T&(v|T)))|T)|T)))&(b&F).

Which can be further simplified to:

    ((F|(l|((F)|(T))|T)|T)))&(b&F).

This simplifies to:

    (T&(b&F)).

And finally, we simplify (b&F) as F. The expression simplifies to:

6. True and any other logical statement = that logical statement (T&X = X)

((!(f|(T&(T&((F&(x&(m&(!T)&F)))|((T&(y|(T|(!T)&F)))|F))))))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T))

Replacing (!T) with F gives us:

((!(f|(T&(T&((F&(x&(m&F&F)))|((T&(y|T&F))|F))))))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T))

Now let's replace x&m&F&F with F and T&F with F:

((!(f|(T&(T&((F|((T&(y|F))|F))))))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T))

Next, replace T&F with F and b&b with b:

Replace (F|F) with F:

6. T | _ --> T (anything OR True is True)
7. !T --> F (NOT True is False)
8. !F --> T (NOT False is True)

The formula can be simplified to:

Removing constants simplifies the formula to:
(notice the usage of _ in representation for any true or false value to simplify the expression)

_ | F = _
w | F = w
(w & w) | F = w | F = w
(T and F) = F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","T & F = F (since both have to be True for AND operation to result in True)
F & F = F (since both have to be True for AND operation to result in True)

Consequently,

i & !(!F | F) = i (since the logical not of F is T and the or operation with F is T then the logical not of T is F)

x | x = x (since this is like saying True or True which gives True, the same way False and False gives True, so basically anything OR the same thing gives the same thing)

x & T = x (since anything AND True gives that thing itself)

F & T = F (since both have to be True for AND operation but F is False therefore the result is False)

T & T = T (since both are True for AND operation to result in True)

The following operations: 

T & F = F
 (((((x&T)|(x | x)) & x) | F) | T)  simplifies to x | T and since anything OR True gives True the whole expression simplifies to T

The final formula now looks like this:

((i & !F) | (i | ((i & (i | T)) | i)))

We know that !F = T 

Making the formula:

(i & T | (i | (i & T | i)))

4. Looking at the next portion, Reducing Double Negation ((!(!T)) becomes T 
5. Similarly, we simplify (!((F&T)&(!T))) to T (as F and anything is F and negation of F is T)
6. Thus reducing further, our equation now simplifies to ((F&T)&(!((w&(h&(F&(j&T)|(T&T))))&F)))
7. Further simplifying F&T results to F (as anything AND False equals False)

- ! (logical not) returns the opposite of the argument.

- T | X is always equal to T, because True makes the result of a logical or operation to always be true.
- F & X is always equal to F, because False makes the result of a logical and operation to always be false.
- T & X is always equal to X, because True does not change the result of a logical and operation.

3) Further simplifications see (T&T) as T, (e&F) as F, (T|T) as T and (F&F) as F.

The formula then becomes:
(T&((T&T)|F)).

4) Simplifying again by assuming (T&T) as T, the expression is further simplified as:
(T&T) which equals to T. 

So, the logical formula simplifies to the value T or True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we simplify the inner sections of the formula.
1. the section (F& (F|T)) is always False, because False & Anything == False.
2. Negation of above section i.e., (!(!(F&(F|T)))) becomes True.
3. The section ((F|T)|(F|F)) is true, because F|T is always True. (False OR True == True)
4. Negation of above section i.e., (!(!(s|(((F|T)|(F|F))|(T&T))))) becomes s, because True OR anything is always True, so s|True == s
5. Hence, the first outer level of operation i.e., T&(F&((!(!(F&(F|T))))&(!(!(s|(((F|T)|(F|F))|(T&T))))))) simplifies to False again, due to False & Anything == False.

Secondly, we simplify the middle sections of the formula. 
6. (t&t)&F simplies to False
7. Hence, section (!(F|((t&t)&F))) becomes True.

Finally, simplifying the whole equation, it becomes False|T|True, which simplifies to True because anything OR True == True.
So, the simplified form of the original formula is T, or True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Ok, let's start with the innermost brackets and work our way out. The immediate thing we can simplify is that: A | F = A, as any statement or is false just equals the statement itself and similarly A & F = F, as any statement and false equals to false. So we can simplify l|F and (l|F)|T to l|T and l&T to T and F, respectively. 

2. Next, A|T = T and A&T = A as anything or True results in True, and anything and True equals to the statement itself. So, (l|T)&F becomes T&F and ((z&(z&z))&T)|T becomes T|T, which are then simplified to F and T respectively.

3. Let's take a look at (!(((F|T)&F)&T)) part. From step 1, we have (F|T) that results T and above operation simplifies as ((T&F)&T) which simplifies to F&T, in turn simplifies to F using A&T = A rule, and then finally by negating the F value from rule !A = opposite of A, we get T.

4. Next up, (p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T can be simplified. Firstly, A|A results in A, therefore (j|j) equals j. Secondly, j&F from j&((j|F)) just equals F, therefore p&(F|T) that simplifies to p&T. Finally, (p&T)|T equals T using A|T = T rule.

5. Finally, looping back, we get ((s|F)|(T&T)), which is (s|T), and equals to T using A|T = T rule.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we simplify the innermost operations:

1. (F|(F&(!(!((v|(!(y&(!(!F))))))))) = F
- Because nothing ORed with F gives the original value. Also, anything ANDed with F gives F.

2. (!((F&(T&(F&T)))&F)) = T
- Because anything ANDed with F gives F. So, its negation gives T.

3. (!((!(T|F))|T)) = T
- Because T ORed with anything gives T. Not any value gives the opposite logical value but not T gives F, so not F gives T.

Inserting these simplifications, we get:

(x&F)&(T&T&T) = (x&F)&T

Next, we simplify the last operations:

4. x&F = F
- Because anything ANDed with F gives F.

5. T&T&T = T
- Because T ANDed with any logical value gives the value itself.

Inserting these simplifications, we get:

F&T = F

In conclusion, the simplified form of the given formula is F.",F,F

(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify redundancies and eliminate logical extremes:

1. Anything OR-ed with True (T) is always True. Therefore, 
   (T|(T|T)) simplifies to T.

2. Anything AND-ed with True is always that thing itself. Therefore, 
   ((F|T)&T)) simplifies to T.

3. Anything OR-ed with False (F) is always that thing itself, and anything AND-ed with False is always False. So, 
   ((w|(f&F)) simplifies to w.

Now, replacing these in the original formula, we get this:

(((w|(w|(w|(w&((!((q|T)&T))|(T&(T&(u|T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T))

Now, keep in mind few principles

1. Double-negation cancels out, so !F is T, !T is F.

2. Anything OR-ed with T is always T, so (F|T) simplifies to T.

Now, we simplify the next set of basic logical identities:

((!(F|F))|F)) - simplifies to (T|F) - based on the fact that F|F is F and !F is T, so we replace !(F|F) with T.
(T|F) - simplifies to T, because anything OR-ed with T is T.

And 

(!((q|T)&T)) - simplifies to !T - based on the principle that anything OR-ed with T is T, and anything AND-ed with T is itself.
!T - simplifies to F, based on the rule that !T is F.

Replacing these in the original formula:

(w|(w|(w|(w&(F|(T&(T&(u|T)))))))&T) - simplifies to T, because anything AND-ed with T is itself.

So, the simplified version of the original logic formula is T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider that anything ORed (|) with F (or False) will ignore F and anything ANDed (&) with T (or True) will ignore T. So, any operation within the brackets involving T and &, or F and |, could be simplified by removing T or F. 

For example, (a|T)&T becomes a|T, (F|F)&T becomes F. Anything ORed (|) with T will always be True, and anything ANDed (&) with F will always be False.

Let's simplify the given logic formula:

((o|(o&(o&(((F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T)|F))))|((v|(e|(T|(f&((F|(F&(!((F|F)&T))))|F)))))|T))

Here, 

- T&((a|T)&T) reduces to (a|T)
- (F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T becomes (F|(F|(F|(a|T)))) which simplifies further to a|T
- ((o|(o&(o&((a|T)&T)|F)))) becomes ((o|(o&(o|(F&a|T)|F)))) and further normalized to o|o|o|a|T = T

Similar simplification can be applied on the other half of the formula starting from ((v|....

- (F|(F&(!((F|F)&T))))|F becomes F
- ((v|(e|(T|(f&((F|F&(!((F|F)&T))))|F)))))|T) simplifies to T

So the overall logic formula simplifies to T|T, which is always True.

    (!T) is F because not T is always F. 
    Then (((F&F))|T)&F) this is simplifying to (F | T) & F = T & F = F.
2. After that, we have y|F which further simplifies to y.
3. Now focus on (((F&F)&(F|T)))&F. Simplify it as follows:
