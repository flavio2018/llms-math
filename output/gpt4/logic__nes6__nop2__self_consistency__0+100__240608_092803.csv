In logical OR operation, true OR anything would be true. So we simplify the term (o | true) as true:

Similarly, (((w|T)&(T&T))|F) simplifies as follows: in the inner parenthesis, any statement OR True is always True, so (w|T) becomes T. Also, (T&T) is always T. Thus, ((w|T)&(T&T)) becomes (T&T) which is T. Therefore, ((w|T)&(T&T))|F is T|F which is True because an OR operation on any logical statement with True is always True.

8. Now, the final expression is (F| (T &F)), which turns into (F|F).

Now considering the second part: ((T&(F&((!F)&T)))|T).
In this part, (!F) -> T (since the not operation reverses the value).

Hence, F or False is F itself, so the formula simplifies to :

((g)&(((T)&T)|F)|(F|F)))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","T&F will simplify to F, because when you ""and"" True and False, you get False (it would only be true if both were true).

Then, y|F simplifies to y, because when you do ""or"" with False, you get the original value (because False doesn't change the outcome in an ""or"" clause).

So we have (!((y&T)|(T|T))), since we replaced (T&F) with F and y|F with y.

T|T simplifies to T, because ""or"" with True always gives True.

So we have (!((y&T)|T)), because we replaced T|T with T.

Also, (y&T) simplifies to y, because ""and"" with True gives you the original value (since True doesn't change the outcome in an ""and"" clause).

So we have (!((y|T))), which simplifies to F, because ""or"" with True always gives True and then we applied a not on True, which gives us False.

Then the expression becomes (F|(!(T|T)), since we replaced !((y|T) with F.

T|T simplifies to T, so we have F|(!T).

!T simplifies to F, so we have in the end, F|F, which simplifies to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the trivial parts like (T&F) and (!T|T):

- (!T|T) always equals to T because !T|T will be True if one of sides is True, but here one side is always the opposite of the other - i.e., one is always True.

Substitute these expressions:

((v&(v|F))&(n&((F)&((T)|((d|T)|F))))).

Next, simplify the expressions (T) and (v|F):
- (T) just equals to T.
- (v|F) just equals to v because v|F is True if one the sides is True and v only could be True or False.

The formula becomes:

((v&v)&&(n&(F&&(T||(d|T))))).

Simplify further:
- v & v is just v, because something AND-ed with itself doesn't change.
- F && anything is just False, because something AND-ed with False is always False.
- T || (d|T) is T because T || D is True and T || T is also True.

Thus, ((b|((((!F)|F)&F)&F)) simplifies to b.

On the other hand, (b | F) is simply b (since anything or False is just that thing), and (b | b) is also b (since anything or itself is just that thing). Thus, ((b|(((b|F)|b)&b))|F)) simplifies to b.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify inner expressions:

((T|F)|T) simplifies to T, because we are using logical or (|) and at least one value is true (T).

(F|T) also simplifies to T, again because at least one value is true.

Next, we simplify the logical and (&) operation in the innermost parentheses:

T&F simplifies to F, because for logical and both values must be true, but here one is false.

T&T also simplifies to T, because both values are true.

Therefore, the formula becomes:

!F simplifies to T, because the opposite of false (F) is true (T).
