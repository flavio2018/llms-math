Now we have [MAX [MIN 4 [MIN 5 9]] [MIN [MAX 1 8] [MAX 3 3]]]. We proceed to the next operation ""MIN 5 9"", which means the minimum between 5 and 9. The minimum between 5 and 9 is 5, therefore MIN 5 9 equals to 5.

So the expression becomes [MAX [MIN 4 5] [MIN [MAX 1 8] [MAX 3 3]]]. We continue with ""MIN 4 5"", which means the minimum of 4 and 5. The minimum is 4, so MIN 4 5 equals 4.

The equation then is [MAX 4 [MIN [MAX 1 8] [MAX 3 3]]]. From there, we perform ""MAX 1 8"", which finds the maximum between numbers 1 and 8. The maximum is 8, so MAX 1 8 equals 8.

The next step results into  [MAX 4 [MIN 8 [MAX 3 3]]]. The operation ""MAX 3 3"" means the maximum of 3 and 3 which is 3. 

Hence, the equation simplifies to [MAX 4 [MIN 8 3]]. Then, the operation ""MIN 8 3"" means the minimum of 8 and 3. The minimum is 3, so MIN 8 3 equals 3.

This leads to [MAX 4 3]. The last operation ""MAX 4 3"" means the maximum of 4 and 3. The maximum is 4, so MAX 4 3 equals 4.
