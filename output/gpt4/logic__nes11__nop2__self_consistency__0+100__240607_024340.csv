A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we simplify the inside parts:

2. T&F = F, because truth value of a logical ""and"" between True and False is False.

4. (T&T)|T = T|T = T, because logical ""or"" between same values gives us the same value.
5. (m&(T&F)) = m&F = F, because ""and"" operation with False always gives False.

After performing these operations, our simplified expression becomes:

((m|((m&T)|((((m&T)&T)&T))|(m|m))))|m)&(m|((i|F)&F)).

But we can still simplify it further:

1. m|m = m, because ""or"" operation with a variable gives us the variable itself.
2. (m&T) = m because T&M = M since ""and"" operation with true gives the variable itself.

   !((k|((k&k)&(((t|(F&j))&t)&T))|T).

2. Any value &-ed with True remains the same (A & True = A). Thus, ((t|(F&j))&t)&T simplifies to (t|(F&j))&t. Also any value AND-ed with itself is equal to itself (A & A = A). Hence, (k&k) simplifies to k.

   So our expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting from innermost parentheses and using boolean algebra we'll simplify the formula:

First, (!F) is equivalent to T, given that ! is logical NOT operator. 

Next, (T|X) where X can be any value is always T, because | is logical OR operator and T OR anything results to T.

So, (T|(!F) simplifies to T.

The formula transforms to:
(((y|F)&(((y&(T&((s|(T&T))|T)))|y)&((y|(g&(s&(F&(a|T)))))&y)))|(F|T))

Any value AND with F (False) is always F, because is F AND anything results to F. 

So, ((w&F)&T) simplifies to F and (F&(a|T)) simplifies to F.

The formula then transforms to:
(((y|F)&(((y&(T&((s|T)|T)))|y)&((y|(g&(s&F)))&y)))|(F|T))

As we just learned, anything OR with True results in True and anything AND with False results in False.

So, ((s|T)|T) simplifies to T and (g&(s&F)) simplifies to F.

The formula now becomes:
(((y|F)&(((y&(T&T))|y)&((y|F)&y)))|(F|T))

Anything AND with True just gives the original value itself.

So, ((y&(T&T)) simplifies to y.

The formula now transforms to:
(((y|F)&(y|y)&((y|F)&y))|(F|T))

Anything OR with itself is just the original value and anything OR with False just gives the original value itself.

So, ((y|F) simplifies to y and (y|y) simplifies to y.

The formula now becomes:

- ""(e & True)"" simplifies to just ""e"", because anything AND True equals itself. 
- simplified ""((e | e) | F)"" equals to ""e OR e"" that simplifies to ""e"", because anything OR itself equals itself and x OR False = x. Either x is True, then the whole expression is True. If x is False, then the whole expression is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify logic formula by replacing expressions with their boolean results. 

- (!T) equals to F (since T is True and negation of True is False)
- (F&F) equals to F (since both are False)
- (T|(!T)) equals to T (since it is True or not True, definitely it is True)
- (n|F) is n (since it is n or False, and OR operation will return True if any of the operands is True; in this case it would be the value of n)
- (!(!(d&F))) simplifies to F (in d&F, d is True or False but F is False, so d&F is False. Negation of this gives True. But there is an extra negation which gives the final result as False)

Now we replace these transformations in the main formula:

((u|((F)&((((F)&T)&(((T)|((n&F))|F))|(F|F))))|F)|u)|(T&F)

This simplifies to:

((u|((F)&((((F)&T)&((T)|F)))))|F)|u)|F

By applying the same logic, we can get the resulting transformations as:

- ((((F)&T)&((T)|F))) equals to F 
- (F&F) is F
- (T|F) is T
- (u|F) equals to u (since it is u or False, and OR operation will return True if any of the operands is True, in this case it would be the value of u)

Now we replace these transformations in the main formula:

((u|F)|F)|u)|F

We can further simplify the result, getting:

((u|F)|u)|F

which ends up as:

(u|u)|F

It's clear that an OR operation of the same values will just return the same value. 

So, the simplification process gives us the resulting logic formula:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The negation of False is True (!F is T), the conjugation of any value (either T or F) with True is the value itself (r|T is r) and conjugation of any value with False is False ((r|T)&F is F).

2. So, this simplifies the formula to: (((o&((o|o)|F)) | (((k|((y&T)&F)) | (m&(!F)))&T)&F)) | (u&F)).

3. A term conjugated with False always gives False, so (y&T)&F, (u&F) become F.

4. This becomes: (((o&((o|o)|F)) | ((k|F)| (!F))&T)&F).

5. A term disjuncted with False gives the term itself, and a term disjuncted with its negation is always True, so (k|F) is k and ((!F)|F) is T.

6. This becomes: (((o&((o|o)|F)) | (k|T)&F).

7. A term disjuncted with True gives True, so (k|T) is T and the negation of a conjunction with False is False (k&F).

8. This becomes: (((o&((o|o)|F)) | T&F).

9. A conjunction of True and False gives False, so (T&F) is F.

10. The formula simplifies to: (o&((o|o)|F)) | F.

11. As stated before, a term disjuncted with False gives the term itself: (o|o) is o.

12. So, this formula simplifies to: (o&(o|F)) | F.

13. Again, a term disjuncted with False gives the term itself: ((o&F)|F)) is o.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Reduce constants:
- T | T = T; 
- F | F = F; 
- T & F = F; 
- T | F = T; 
- !F = T.

So, the original equation turns into:

(!(!(T & (v | T)| (T | ( !T & F ) | T) | (T & T)))).

2. Continue reducing:

- T & T = T; 
- T | T = T; 
- !T = F;

Now we have:

(!(!(T & T & v | T & T))).

This simplifies further to:

(!(!(T & v | T))).

3. The use of De Morgan's laws can simplify it further:

- !(A & B) = (!A | !B); 
- !(A | B) = (!A & !B). 

So it becomes:

(!T | !(T & v)).

4. However, we know that !T is always False. So it becomes F | !(T & v). 

5. There is another law in logic that states (F | A) = A. So, the final simplified form of the expression is:

! (T & v).

And, since T is always true, it simplifies to:

!v.

1) (T&(F&T)) = (T&F) = F,  because both T&F leads to False.

2) (T|F) = T, because T|F leads to True.

3) ((T|F)&F) = (T&F) = F, as T&F leads to False.

4) (!((T&F)) = !(F) = T, because the negation of False is True.

5) (!F) = T, because the negation of False is True.

Replace these simplified elements into the main formula. 

The formula becomes:
(((z&(F|T))|F)|((z&(!((T|((z|T)|F|T)))&T))&T))

Further simplify the formula. 

1) (F|T) = T, because F|T leads to True.

2) (F|T) = T, because F|T leads to True.

3) (!T) = F, because the negation of True is False.

The formula becomes:
((z&T|F)|((z&F)&T))

Further simplification can be done to reduce the formula. 

1) (z&T) = z, because z&T when true leads to 'z'. 

2) ((z&F)&T) = (F&T) = F, because z&F leads to False and T&F also leads to False.

2. (T & T) also simplifies to T. So and operation with T and F results in F: ((T&F)). This simplifies to F. The inner expression becomes ((T | F)) which simplifies to T.
3. The expression (((F & (F | T)) & T) | T) simplifies to T, because F and anything results to F, and anything or T is T. So, we can simplify (a & T) to just 'a'.

1. Anything combined with 'and' (&) with False (F) is always F. So, (k&F) = F, (q&F)=F, (u&F)=F, etc.
2. Anything combined with 'or' (|) with False (F) is always the other value. So, (k|F)=k, etc.

3. (!(q&F)&((!T)|(T|F))) simplifies to (!F & (F | T & F)) which is (!F & (F | F)) which is just !F. This resolves to T (since the negation of F is T).

3. The expression !(!(o&o)) is equivalent to just (o&o) which simplifies to just o.

- (T&T) is T since True and True is True.
- (s|F)&(!F)) is just S, because s or False is s, not False is True, and s combined with True results in S.
- (m&(((s|F)&(!F))&T)|T) is just True, because any expression or True is True.
- Any expression or False or (expression & True) is just expression, because expression & True does not change the expression and expression or False doesn't change the expression as well.

So, considering these simplifications, you get:

This simplifies to:

3. d|F simplifies to d and d|d simplifies to d. Then (((d|F)&(d|d))|F) becomes ((d&d)|F) which is (d|F) which is d.
4. Therefore, o&((!F)&(F|d|T)) becomes (o&(T&d|T)) which is (o&(d|T)) which is o|T = T.

((t|(t&T))&((t&(((p|F)&F)|(((F|(T&T))&((T&((a|F)|T))&T))&T)))|t)).

Next, any letter AND True equals that same letter. Therefore, (t&T) could be simplified to t, thereby turning your expression into:
((t|t)&((t&(((p|F)&F)|(((F|T)&((T&((a|F)|T))&T))&T)))|t)).

Also, anything OR False equals that letter itself, implying (p|F) simplifies to p which changes the expression to:
((t|t)&((t&((p&F)|(((F|T)&((T&((a|F)|T))&T))&T)))|t)).

Next, any letter AND False equals False, which means (p&F) simplifies to F. The expression now becomes:
((t|t)&((t&((F)|(((F|T)&((T&((a|F)|T))&T))&T)))|t)).

((t|t)&((t&((F)|(((F|T)&((T&(a|T))&T))&T)))|t)).

((t|t)&(((t&T)&T)|t)).

Again, using that any letter AND True equals same letter, the expression simplifies to:
((t|t)&((t&T)|t)).

Again, any letter AND True equals that letter, the expression simplifies to:

3. The expression (((T|(F&F))|T)|F) simplifies to (T|F|T|F), which is True because there are being OR'd with True, and anything OR'd with True is True.

4. The expression ((u&T)&(((T|(F&F))|T)|F)) simplifies to ((u&T)&T), since (((T|(F&F))|T)|F) simplifies to T as we explained above. This further simplifies to (u&T) because anything AND'd with True remains the same.

5. The expression (T&T) is T because anything AND'd with True remains the same. So this entire part is True.

3. (((m|(T&F))&T)|T) simplifies to True because '(anything&T) or T' always yields True. 

4. (t|(!(F&(F&T)))) simplifies to (t|(!(False))) i.e., (t|True), hence it is always True (T or anything is always True).

5. So finally we get the entire expression as: ((True)&(!(w|True)&(!(True|False)))).

5) The predicate inside the second Not operator, i.e.,

Hence, the left side of the equation simplifies to F. 

Now let's simplify the right side. 

Look at (((l&F)&T)&((!T)|T))). This is always equal to F because l&F is equal to F, and then F&T is also equal to F.

We also notice immediately that ((d&(d|(d&d)))|T) is equivalent to T, because anything OR'd with true is true. 

Then, also, (!(m&(n&F))) = (!m|!n). Since it's anded (AND) with T, it simplifies to itself because anything AND'd with true remains the same.

Secondly, the expression F&F results in False value and any variable and'ed with False(F&F&F) just results in False. The same goes for anything and'ed with True (like (s&T), it simplifies to just the variable since anything and'ed with True is just that thing itself. (!F) also becomes True since not False is True.

6. The formula ((e&(e|e&e)) simplifies to (e&e) since (e|e&e) is e, and (e&e) simplifies to e.
