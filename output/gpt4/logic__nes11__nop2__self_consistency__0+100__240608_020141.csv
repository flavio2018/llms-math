A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) ""F|(!F)"" is always true regardless of the value of !F or F. So let's simplify this to ""T"".

2) ""F|(T&T)"" is true because ""T&T"" is true, so one side of the or operation ""|"", is true. So this can simplified to ""T"".

3) ""(F&T)|(T|T))"" simplifies to ""|T"" because ""(F&T)"" is false and ""T"" is true, so ""|T"" is always true. 

4) So the function simplifies to:
(((j|(!T))&j)|((((j&(T&w))&j)|j)|F)|j))

5) The formula ""!T"" is always false. So, ""j|(!T)"" simplifies to ""j"". 

6) The formula ""T&w"" is the same as ""w"", because if ""w"" is true, the result is true, and if ""w"" is false, the result is false. 

7) Consequently, the proposition simplifies to:
(((j)&j)|(((j&(w)&j)|j)|F)|j))

8) ""(j&(w)&j)"" simplifies to ""(j&w)"" because ""j&j"" is just ""j"" 

9) The proposition simplifies to:
((j|((j&w)|j)|F)|j))

10) Now, because ""j"" is common to all the terms inside the big OR operator, we can actually simplify this to just ""j"", because if ""j"" is true, the whole expression is true regardless of the values of ""w"" or ""F"", and if ""j"" is false, the whole expression is false.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can reduce the expression (T|F) to T, as T OR F = T. Also, F&T = F. That leads us to:

!(k|((k&(k|F))&(((t|(F&j))&t)&(F|F|T))|F|T)).

Next, F OR T = T, F AND j = F (where j can be either T or F), and (k OR F) = k. That gives us:

!(k|((k&k)&((t|F)&t)&T)|T).

Simplify again: t OR F = t, so we have:

!(k|((k&k)&(t&t)&T)|T).

Obviously: k AND k = k and t AND t = t, therefore:

!(k|(k&t&T)|T).

k AND T = k (because k AND T = k if k is T and equals F if k is F), and t AND T = t (for the same reasons). So our expression becomes:

!(k|(k&t)|T).

Substitute (k|(k&t)) with k (as k OR k AND t = k, because if k is T then the whole expression is T, if k is F then the whole expression equals t, which can be T or F, depending on the value of t). So we get:

!(k|T).

Finally, X OR T = T (because T is the highest truth value, X gets ignored). So we can further reduce the expression to:

!T.

And as logical NOT of T is F, the final simplified version of the given logical expression is:

2. (T|True) will always result in T because it is true or true which is true.
3. (F&T) will always result in F because it is false and true which is always false.
4. (s|T) will always result in T because it is false and true which is always false.
5. (a|T) will always result in T because it is any condition or true which is always true.
6. (F&T) will always result in F because it is false and any condition which is always false. 
7. (s&F) will always result in F because it is any condition and false which is always false.
8. (g&F) will always result in F because it is any condition and false which is always false. 
9. ((F&y) will always result in F because it is false and any condition which is always false.
10. F|T will always result in T because it's saying false OR true which would always be True.

So, simplifying it all down you get:

(y|T)

Which means y OR true. 

This will give T regardless of the value of y (since if y is True, True OR True = True, and if y is False, True OR False = True).

4. Also, we know that anything AND True is itself. So, (T&T) gives T and T&F gives F.

5. Not of False (!F) is True and anything AND True keeps the original value. Hence, (y|(!F))&F simplifies to y&F, which is simply False because anything AND False is Fault.

6. Two (!) negate each other. That is, not of not is the original value. Therefore, (!(!(((r|T)&(T&T))&F)))) becomes (((r|T)&(T&T))&F), simplifying to F.

Then, the logical OR operator `|`, is only false when all literals are false, so `X | F` is `X` and `X | T` is always `T`. 

We can apply these facts to the expression:

`((c|(!T))|(T&(((y&y)&y)|(y|((c&(c&(c&T)))|((T|(((w&F)&F)|(T&((d&d)|(!F)))))&T)))))`

1. Simplifying `!T` is `F`, so the inner part `c | (!T)` becomes `c | F`, which is equal to `c`. `!F` is `T`, and `w & F` is `F`.

2. Applying our rule for `&` and `|` operations to the right side of the expression, `T & (((y&y)&y)|(y|((c&(c&(c&T)))|((T|(((F)&F)|(T&((d&d)|T)))))&T))))` simplifies to 

`T & ((y | ((c & c)|T))`.

3. Reducing `c & c` simply yields `c`, so the expression further simplifies to `T & (y | (c | T))`.

4. `c | T` is always `T`, and `y | T` is also `T`, so the expression becomes `T & T`.

5. Finally, `T & T` is `T`. This means the original expression is equivalent to 

`c | T`, which is always `T`.

So the simplified formula after performing all above operations is `T`.

   (o|(!(T&F)))|F simplifies to: 
   o|nF|F = o|F, as T&F is False (since one of them is False). o|F is simply o (anything or False is the thing itself).

   After applying these simplifications, the formula becomes:

   (((z|(z|(!T)))|F)|(((b|(((!(o)|F))|F)&F))|T)&F).

2. Further simplify expressions.

   The inner (z|(!T)) becomes z|F = z (any x or False is x).

   the (!(o)|F) gives us (!o) as anything or False is simply that thing.

   z|z gives z (anything or itself is the itself).

   (!o)|F simplifies to (!o) (as discussed above).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to look at the smallest components of the logic formula and simplify those first. 

1. (F & anything) is always False (F), because logical 'and' requires both elements to be true to return true. But F stands for False, so this means any compound expression including it will be False.
 
2. Similarly, (anything | F) simplifies to (anything). Because logical 'or' needs only one of its elements to be true to return true. So if one of them is False, the resultant truth value will be exactly the other value.

3. (o&o) is simply (o). And therefore o|(o&o) will also be (o).

4. (!F) is True (T), because logical 'not' reverses the truth value.

5. (!((((o|(o&o))|F)&((o&(((o|(F&F))&(o|(o|o)))&(o|F)))&o))&F))) is the most complex part of this formula. But if we simplify all smaller parts with rules 2 and 3, this results in (!(((o)&((o&(((o))&(o)))&o))&F))) which is equivalent to !((o&o)&F) that is equal to !(F) and it simplifies to (T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula simplifies as follows:

1. Start from the innermost elements of the formula:

   (T | (T | F)) evaluates to T because T | F is T.  
   (!T | (T | F)) evaluates to F because ¬T is F.  
   (i & F) evaluates to F regardless of the value of i.

Secondly, (T&(!T)) is equivalent to (True & False) which is False. So, (((T&(!T))&T)) leads to False.

Now, substitute these simplified terms into the original formula. You get:

(o|(o|o))|(o&o|(False|False))|(F|((((x|F)&T)|False)&F))

Simplify (o|(o|o)) to get o because o or o results in o. Similarly, (o&o) results in o.

Also, simplify (((x|F)&T)|False)&F) to F because (AnyValue & False) is always False.

Then, simplify the formula as:

!F = T (the 'not' operator inverts the truth value)

!(T) = F

Once these are known, substitute the values into the original expression:

This then simplifies the first half of the problem to `!(T)` which means `False (F)`. 

Next, we handle the second half of the statement. For `(T&(i&F))`, similar to the step above, it would be `False (F)` (because anything `and` with `False` would be `False`). 
Then, using this value to simplify `(!(T&(i&F)))` we get `!F` which is `True (T)`.
Now, we need to simplify `((T|(F|(m&F)))|F)` - for `(m&F)`, this would be `False (F)` (because anything `and` with `False` would be `False`). Thus,  simplifying `((T|(F|(m&F)))|F)` we get `(T|F|F)` which would be `True (T)` for the same reason as the first half of this problem - `True or anything` is `True`. 

This means the statement simplifies to `(((T&(!F))|T)|F)` that results in `(T|T|F)` which is `True (T)`, and this means `!(True)` is `False (F)`.

2. `(z | (z | z))` therefore becomes `(z|z)`, which we have just established is also `z`.

3. `((T&(F&(T&T))))` becomes `T & F` which is `F` because and operation (`&`) requires both parts to be true to be true. 

4. `(F|(F|F))` becomes `(F|F)` which is `F` because or operation (`|`) returns true only if at least one of the parts is true. In this case, both are false, so the result is false.

5. `!F` is `T` because using not operation (`!`) on false (`F`) returns true (`T`). 

6. So, we now have `((((((z & z) | F) & T) | (F & (T & F)) & z) & T))))`. The second term `((z & z) | F)` can simplify to `(z | F)` because (z & z) is just z. 

7. `(z|F)` results in `z` because an or operation returns true if at least one of the parts is true and z can be either true or false.

8. `z & T` is `z` because an and operation requires both parts to be true to return true. If z is true, the result would be true. If z is false, the result would be false.

9. `F & (T&F)` is `F` because the second term results in false and an and operation with false is false.

With these rules, we can simplify the given logical formula:

Starting with the deepest nested parentheses:
((((o&T)&T)&o)|(((o&T)|o)|F))&F - Since anything & F is False, we can simplify it to: F

Step 2:
Next level of parentheses:
!(t&(F))&T - Since anything & F is False, we can simplify this to: !t& T

Step 3:
Negate !t & T gives us: !(t&F) = !(False) = True

Step 4:
Now, we have the formula simplified to (not True! (True & True)) & (not ((((n | n)) & n) | T) & F).

Applying these rules to our logic formula, we can simplify it to:
```py
((T&((z&1)|1))|(1|!((((!1)|(1|1))|F)|1)&F)))

Furthermore, `not True` is `False`, `not False` is `True`, so we change `!T` to `F`.

((T&((z|1))|(1|!(((F)|(1|1))|F|1)&F)))
```
Since `z|1` is `True`, we can further simplify the above logic to:
```py
((T&(1))|(1|!((F|1)|F|1)&F))

In boolean logic, `&` operation has higher priority than `|`, same as the multiplication has higher priority than addition in arithmetic operations.

2. Conditions & True: If we have this condition if will keep the value of other element. Example: T&T=T.
3. Conditions | True: We see that this condition have a final value as True since anything Logical OR with True gives you True. Example: (!F)|T = T.

3. (!T)&F is equivalent to F because of conditions & False. Thus we get (!((T&T|F|F))|(T&!T)).
4. T&T is equivalent to T because of conditions & True. Thus we get (!((T|F|F))|(T&!T)).
5. T|F is equivalent to T because of conditions | True. Thus we get (!T|(T&!T)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, bear in mind the following:
- A & F will always be F. This is because one false in a statement with all AND logic makes the whole statement false.
- A | T will always be T. This is because one true in a statement with all OR logic makes the whole statement true.
- !F will always be T. This is a NOT logical operation, inverting the value of F.
  
From these rules, we can simplify:

1. F & \<A\> = F: This rule makes (((F&(T&(T&T)))&F)) equal F and ((((!F)&(T|T))&T)&F) also equal F.

2. A | T = T: This then makes w|((F&((F&(T&(T&T)))&F))|F) and  w|(u&&(u&((((!F)&(T|T))&T)&F))) equal T. These were the initial two parts of the logical formula, excluding the OR logic operator between them, which also means these two parts combined equal T.

3. F | (T&F)= F | F = F: The last part of the logical formula.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that (F&T) is equivalent to False because F means False and nothing can be ANDed with False to return True.

And (T|F) is always true, because T means True, and anything ORed with True is always True.

The formula simplifies to:
((T&(!(!(F|(F&False)))))|((F&(T|(T|(((q|q)&((q&((T|F)|(False)))&(q|(q|F))))|(!F)))))&T)).

Now, take (!(!(F|(F&False)))) which simplifies to (!(!(F|False))) and further simplifies to (!F) and then to T because the NOT operation negates F (False) to T (True).

Similarly, ((q|q)&((q&((T|F)|(False)))&(q|(q|F)))) simplifies to
((q|q)&((q&(T|False))&(q|(q|F)))) which further reduces to ((q|q)&((q&T)&(q|(q|F)))) and finally becomes ((q|q)&(q&(q|(q|F)))) because anything ANDed with True is itself.

So, insert these simplifications back into the formula:

((T&T)|((F&(T|(T|((q&q)&(q|(q|F))))))&T)).

Take (T&T) -> It is the same as T because anything ANDed with True is itself.

On the other side, notice (F&T) equals False and anything ORed with False remains itself.

So, also ((F&T)|(T|((q&q)&(q|(q|F)))))

simplifies to (False|(T|((q&q)&(q|(q|F)))))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Replace the redundant operation (F|F), (b|b), and ((!T)&T)) with their respective and simplified answers. Towards that:

    - b|b is equal to b (because we don't know exactly if b is True or False, however whatever its value, OR-ing it with itself will give the same value)
    - ((!T)&T) is equal to F (because it essentially means (False AND True) which is False)

Using these, our expression becomes: 
    ((T|(!(F&T))) & (T&(!((d|((b&b)&b))|(F|(d&F)))|T)))

2. Now let's simplify the remaining operations with F and T. Toward that:
    - F&T is equal to F (because False AND any logical value is False), and
    - Any logical value OR-ed with False(F) and AND-ed with True(T) will remain the same.

Substituting these values, our expression becomes:
    ((T|!F) & (T&!(d|b)|T))

3. Now simplifying the NOT operation on F, because !(F) is T (NOT of False is True), we get:
    ((T|T) & (T&!(d|b)|T))

4. Further reducing OR operations with True i.e., any logical value OR-ed with True (T) is always True. So, our expression becomes:

First, start with the most deeply nested expressions. `T|T` is True, `!T` is False. So, `((T|T)|(!T))` simplifies to `(T|F)`, which is True. Similarly, `T&(F&T)` simplifies to `T&F`, which is False, and finally `n&(T&(F&T))` simplifies to `n&F`, which is False. Thus, our expression becomes:

`((((r&(((n&F)&F)|T))&r)&r)&(F|(((s|(!(T&T)))|s)&F))`.

Step 2: Simplification of Middle-level Expressions
The next expressions to simplify are `((n&F)&F)` and `(!(T&T))`. `((n&F)&F)` simplifies to `F`, and `(!(T&T))` simplifies to `!T`, which is False. So, our expression becomes:

`((((r&F)&r)&r)&(F|((s|F)&F))`.

Step 3: Simplification of High-level Expressions
Then, `r&F` simplifies to `F`, and `((s|F)&F)` simplifies to `F`. Now our expression becomes:

`(((F&r)&r)&(F|F))`.

Step 4: Final Simplification
Finally, `F&r` simplifies to `F`, `F|F` simplifies to `F`, so our expression becomes:

6. We can simplify e&e&T&e&e to just e, because ""and"" operation with the same value doesn't change that value.

    !((e|F)|T) or !((T|F)&T)

7. But e|F|T simplifies to True (because ""or"" operation with the True value gets the result as True) and (T|F)&T simplifies to just T (because ""or"" operation with False value doesn't change the value and T&T is just T).

8. Therefore, the original formula translates to:

    !(True) or !(T)

9. Finally:

    False or False => False

So, the simplification of this logic formula is False.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Each operation has its own truth values rules. Let's go through them.

1. For a '&' operation, if any operand is 'F' then the result is 'F'. If both are 'T' then the result is 'T'.
2. For a '|' operation, if any operand is 'T' then the result is 'T', if both are 'F' the result is 'F'.
3. For a '!' operation, it just flips the operand. If operand is 'T' then the result is 'F' and vice versa.

Following these rules:

a. Simplify within each inner parentheses:

(!(!(T&(T|T)))) simplifies to T because T&(T|T) results in T, then double negation (!!) produces T.
((F&(T)&T)) simplifies to F because F&T results in F
((F|T)|F) simplifies to T because F|T results in T
(F&(n&F)) simplifies to F because n&F results in F (since any value ANDed with F gives F)
Thus, ((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F)) simplifies to F (from above results)
Then !(F|F) simplifies to T because F|F results in F and not F is T
Then (T&(!(i|T))) simplifies to F because T&F gives F (any value ANDed with F gives F)
Finally T&j simplifies to j (since j&T = j and any truth value ANDed with T gives itself)

b. Simplify the outer structure:

((j&F)|T)&((F|F)|T) simplifies to T, since any value ORed with T gives T (even for ((j&F)|T), because j&F gives F and F|T gives T)
and any value ANDed with T gives itself (hence the whole expression gives T).

So, the whole expression simplifies to T.",T,j

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the always true/false literals:
T|T -> T
F|T -> T
F&T -> F
T&!T -> F
Since we have !(T) which means not true i.e. it gives false i.e. 'F', let's substitute it.

The equivalent simplified expression will be:

((((s&T)&s)|s)):
The result is:

(s&s)|s -> s|s -> s

So, the simplified logic formula is s.",s,s
