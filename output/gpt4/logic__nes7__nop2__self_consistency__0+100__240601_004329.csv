A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, observe that `False & X` is always `False` no matter what value `X` holds. Similarly, `X | True` is always `True` no matter what value `X` holds. Also, when expression `X | F` occurs, it is equivalent to `X` only. Lastly, !T is always `False`.

So let's apply these logic principles on original formula:

- `F & (F&F)` simplifies to `F` (because `False & X` is always `False`)
- `(F&F)` simplifies to `F` (because `False & X` is always `False`)
- `(F or (z or T))` simplifies to `True` (because `X | True` is always `True`)
- `(!T | F)` simplifies to `F` (because `!True` or 'not of True' is `False` and `X | False` is `X`)
- `T & F` simplifies to `F` (because `True & False` is always `False`)

Substituting these into the original logical expression:

((F&(F&F))&((((F&F)|((F|(z|T))|((!T)|F)))&(T&F))&T))

- Step 2: apply the de Morgan’s laws.
The part (! ((s | s) & F)) simplifies to (! (s & F)), by the Idempotent laws of Logic, which further simplifies to (! F) or T by the Simplification laws.

- Step 3: simplify F (T OR Anything) as T.

The expressions (False & T) and (F & F) also result in F (False). 
The expressions T | T | T result in T (True). 

So, the initial formula will simplify to:

We know that (False & F), which is equivalent, results in F (False). Hence, the semifinal formula will simplify to:

Since (F & F) results in F (False), it can be further reduced to:
(r | (m | F | F)) | T.

Since (F | F) result to F (False), it reduces to :
(r | m | F) | T.

2. Besides, 'T' with '& operator' and 'F' with '! operator' always renders True. So !F equals 'T' and (T&F) gets simplified to 'F'. 

3. So, (a&T) is 'a', (!F) is True, and (T&F) is False, so the expression ((a&T)|(!F))|(T&F) simplifies to (a|T|F), which is 'T'.

4. Also, 'F' with '|' operator always maintains the other operand as it is, so (F|T) simplifies to 'T'. Thus, the expression ((t&(((a&T)|(!F))|(T&F)))&(F|(n|T)) simplifies to (t&T) which is 't'.

Simplifies to:
((u&(u&((u|((F&!T)))&T)))|(!(((l&T)&T)|T)))

In Boolean logic, the result of an operation 'and' between a value false and anything else remains false. So, (F&!T) is false:
((u&(u&((u|F)&T)))|(!(((l&T)&T)|T)))
Simplifies to:
((u&(u&(u&T)))|(!((l&T)|T)))

Since an operation 'and' between true and any other value results in that value, (u&T) simplifies to u. Also, 'and' operation between the same values is the same value. So, simplifying u&(u&u) leads to u. Moreover, T&T is True, so the expression simplifies as follows:
((u&u)|(!((l&T)|T)))
Simplifies to: 
(u|(!(l|T)))

The second part of the formula is an OR operation between l and T. As in Boolean logic, the result of an OR operation with a true input is true, so:
(u|!T)

Not T is false, so the whole formula simplifies to:

F|T is T.
F|(T|T) is T.
F|T is again T, no matter its position in the expression.
T&F is F
F|F is again F.

So, the expression becomes !F & !(T|F) which simplifies to:

T & !T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, negate True and False with logical not symbol. It's like this:

!T = F; !F = T. 

In the inner most brackets, we have T & (!F). When we substitute the above values, we get: 

T & (!F) = T & T = T 

Now, let's read the initial expression with the values we determined:

!((! T) |(o|c|(((n&F)|F)|F)))

In the expression, we have (n&F)|F and (n&F) returns False (F) because no matter what the value of n is, it's going to be logical AND with False which results in False. So, (n&F)|F can be rewritten as F|F = F. 

Then our simplified expression will look like:

!((! T) |(o|c|F))

Since not of T (!T) results to False (F), the expression now becomes

!(F |(o|c|F))

Instead of F | F, let's simplify (o|c|F) which returns the value of either o or c or True (since F or True = True). 

Therefore, we can simplify the previous expression to: 

! (F | True)

In the final simplification, we can see that False or True, using the logical OR operator, will always return True. 

So the final and simplified answer of the given expression is: 

!T

In the inner brackets, the result of a logical or operation where one of the elements is True ((T|F), (T|F|F)) is always True. g&F becomes F because the result of an and operation where one of the elements is False is always False.

So then the formula simplifies as: ((k|F)|k)&(T&T).

Both k|F and T&T are equivalent to k and T respectively.
 
So the formula becomes: k|k&T - according to the properties of the logical operations AND and OR (OR is stronger than AND).

Looking at (m|T), since anything OR True is always true, so it simplifies to T:

b & T = b (similarly here, the True value doesn't affect the result, we are left with b)

The formula now becomes:

We have already established that b & T = b, so:
((b&b)&!(!((w&T)|T)))

b & b = b (it is itself)

The formula now becomes:

2. The expression within the second set of innermost parentheses (F&(T&(T&(F&F)))) simplifies to F because F&anything is F. So, we have:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, `F & T` is always False. By ""and"" operation, if one of them is False, the result is also False. So `(!(!(F & T)) | F)` simplifies to `(!(!F) | F)`, which is `(!F | F)`. Since `!F` is True and `F` is False, True `or` False equals to True. So `(!(!(F & T)) | F)` simplifies to True.

The same logic is applied to `((x | ((x | F) | x)) & F)`. The `or` operation applies that if one of them is True, the result is also True. Here, `x | F` is True if `x` is True, and False if `x` is False. So it does not change the value of `x`. Thus, `x | x | x` simplifies to `x`. However, we have `x & F`, which always equals to False, because the ""and"" operation requires both operands to be True to be True. So `((x | ((x | F) | x)) & F)` simplifies to False.

Since we have `(!(False) & !(False))`, applying the `not` operation transforms False into True, we get `(True & True)`, which simplifies to True. 

So, the answer is `True`.",True,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. In the formula (T|T), | denotes OR operation, hence it will result in True i.e., T.
So the part (T&(T|T)) simplifies to T&T which is True, because AND operation results in True when both values are True.

2. Also, (T&F) results in False, because AND operation will be False even if any one of the literal values is False. Now the part (T&F)|(T|T) becomes F|T which simplifies to True, as OR operation results True when any one of the literal values is True.

3. Correspondingly, (!F) will result in True, as NOT operation negates the literal value, So True OR True will also result in True. So (((T&F)|(T|T))|(!F)) simplifies to T.

4. Now the part ((n&T)|(((T&F)|(T|T))|(!F)))&T simplifies to (n&T)|T&T which simplifies to either n or (True AND True) which obviously simply to n or True = True.

5. Finally, from the above simplifications, the main formula

2. Substituting these in the given formula, we have: (((c|c)|c)|((((((c&T)&c)|c)&(c|F))&c)&c)).
3. Now let's consider the And operation ""c&T"". As per the AND operation rule, if both the operands are True, then result is True. Since here, one of the operand is True (""T""), ""c&T"" will always result in whatever the value ""c"" holds.
4. Substitute back to the formula: (((c|c)|c)|((((((c&c)|c)&(c|F))&c)&c))).
5. Now consider the multiple repeat OR operation ""c|c|c"". As per the OR operation rule, ""c|c|c"" will always result in the value that ""c"" holds. Similarly, consider the repeat AND operation ""c&c&c"", which will also result in the value ""c"" holds.
6. Substituting these we have simplified formula: (c|((c|c)&c)).
7. If you apply the same principles of ""c|c"" and ""c&c"", we can simplify further:

2. ""!"" negates the value of the statement. So, (!(T | F)) becomes F because T | F is always true and its negation will always be false.

3. ""F"" also falsifies a statement when it comes in disjunction ""|"" with it. So, (F | (l & F)) is F and ((F & (o & F)) | F) is F.
