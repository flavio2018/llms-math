Perform MIN 6 9 9 4, which gives 4(minimum of these numbers).

=> b = MAX(MIN(0, ...), ... , 3, 1)
=> b = MAX(MIN(0, 1, ...), ..., 1) compute the value for MIN(2, 2, 7, 3) which equals 2

[SM 5 [SM 6 0 6 2] 0 2] = [SM 5 (6+0+6+2)%10 0 2] = [SM 5 4 0 2]

So [SM 5 4 0 2] = (5+4+0+2)%10 = 1

- [MAX 2 2 5 8] would give 8, as MAX operator gives the maximum number in the list.
- [MIN 9 8 8 3] would give 3, as MIN operator gives the minimum number in the list.
- [SM 7 3 1 1] this would give 12 but since it's the SM operator we always do modulo 10 so the result is 2.
- [SM 0 8 5 9] would give 22 but with modulo 10 the result is 2.

Substituting these values back into the original expression we get:

- [MIN 1 1 1 4] would give 1.
- [SM 8 7 1 4] would give 20 but with modulo 10 the result is 0.
- [SM 7 6 5 1] would give 19 but with modulo 10 the result is 9.
- [MAX 6 6 6 8] would give 8.

Substituting these values we get:

[MIN 3 [MIN 7 0 5 [MIN 6 2 4 2]] [MIN 8 [MIN 1 9 4 0] [MIN 9 4 3 8] 0] 1]

Now, we can continue computing the [MIN] operators:

- [MIN 7 0 5 [MIN 6 2 4 2]] would give 0 (as MIN is 0).
- [MIN 1 9 4 0] would give 0.
- [MIN 9 4 3 8] would give 3.

Substituting these values:

[MIN 3 0 [MIN 8 0 [MIN 3 0] 1]

For MIN/MAX pick the smallest/biggest number from the list of numbers.
For SM calculate the sum of numbers from left to right in the list and take the last digit of the sum.

- [MIN 1 3 6 3] reduces to the smallest number 1.
- [MIN 5 0 0 9] reduces to the smallest number 0.

- [SM 4 3 2 5] calculates to (4+3+2+5)=14, modulo 10 gives 4.

Hence, the expression can be rewritten as:

- [SM 1 4 8 9] calculates to (1+4+8+9)=22, modulo 10 gives 2.

Hence, the expression can be rewritten as:

- [MAX 0 8 0] reduces to 8.
- [SM 2 8 0 2] calculates to (2+8+0+2)=12, modulo 10 gives 2.

Finally, the expression can be rewritten as:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to work inside out of these expressions and try to simplify the inner expressions.

[SM 5 6 5 7] = ((5+6+5+7) % 10) = 3.
So, we can replace [SM 5 6 5 7] in our original expression with 3.

Also, [MIN 5 3 1 8] = 1, [MIN 3 6 9 9] = 3, [MIN 6 5 3 9] = 3.
So, we replace these expressions in our original expression / question with their corresponding results.

[SM 3 1 3 1] = ((3+1+3+1) % 10) = 8.
And, [MIN 3 9 1 3] = 1, [MAX 4 2 7 6] = 7, [SM 0 5 0 1] = 6, [SM 3 3 0 1] = 7, and [MAX 9 9 5 5] = 9.

Let's substitute these in the simplified expression.
We get: [MIN [MIN 8 5 1] 2 4 [SM 3 [SM 7 1 2 6] [MAX 2 7 0 9] 0]].

Further simplifying, we get [MIN [MIN 8 5 1] 2 4 [SM 3 [SM 7 1 2 6] 9 0]].
Here, [MIN 8 5 1] = 1, [SM 7 1 2 6] = 6. 

So, the modified expression now becomes: [MIN 1 2 4 [SM 3 6 9 0]].
Then, [SM 3 6 9 0] = ((3+6+9) % 10) = 8.

So, the final simplified expression is [MIN 1 2 4 8].

- MIN 4 6 4 2 equals 2
- MIN 2 6 3 3 equals 2
- SM 3 9 1 6 equals ((3+9+1+6) mod 10), which equals 9
- MAX 9 9 0 8 equals 9
- SM 7 0 8 4 equals ((7+0+8+4) mod 10), which equals 9
- MIN 6 6 7 7 equals 6
- MAX 5 3 3 0 equals 5

So, the original expression becomes:

- MAX 1 2 2 7 equals 7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's evaluate the MAX and MIN functions. 

[MIN 6 [SM 7 8 [MAX 6 5 8 6] [MAX 0 0 5 7]]] - The maximas from the nested expressions are [MAX 6 5 8 6] which gives 8 and [MAX 0 0 5 7] which gives 7.

So then, SM 7 8 8 7 = 30. Since SM is the sum modulo 10, we have SM = 30 mod 10 = 0.

So, our expression becomes [MIN 6 0], which gives us 0.

In the next function, [MAX [MAX 0 2 3 4] [SM 7 6 1 3] 1 3] - The maximum from the nested expressions are [MAX 0 2 3 4] gives 4 and [SM 7 6 1 3] gives SM = 1 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 17 mod 10 = 7.

So, our expression becomes [MAX 4 7 1 3], which gives us 7.

Continuing to [MAX 3 7 [SM [MIN 0 2 1 2] 0 2 [MIN 0 8 8 7]] [SM 5 4 [MAX 2 0 5 1] [MAX 6 1 3 0]]], consider the SM function:

[SM [MIN 0 2 1 2] 0 2 [MIN 0 8 8 7]] - Here the minimums are 0 and 0. So, SM = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2.

Continuing, [SM 5 4 [MAX 2 0 5 1] [MAX 6 1 3 0]], the maximum are 5 and 6. So, the sum modulo 10 is SM = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 mod 10 = 5.

Finally, the MAX 3 7 2 5 gives 7, which is our answer here.

For the lower half the max and min along with sum are as follows:

MAX [SM 7 8 1 8] 3 [SM 3 7 7 3] 9 = 9 
SM 7 8 1 8 = 24
SM 3 7 7 3 = 20  
Similar to above, SM 24 = SM 20 = 0

MIN [SM 1 6 1 9] 8 2 [MAX 7 5 1 8] = 1
SM 1 6 1 9 = 17
MAX 7 5 1 8 = 8

Substitute these results into the equation to get the following:

[SM [MAX [SM 4 9 5 8] 1 [MAX 8 0 4 4] 6] 8 4 [SM 1 9 1 2]].
[SM [MAX 26 1 [MAX 8 0 4 4] 6] 8 4 [SM 1 9 1 2]].
As we know SM 26 = SM 6 = 6, MAX 8 0 4 4 = 8 so substitute these value to acquire the following line
[SM [MAX 6 1 8 6] 8 4 [SM 1 9 1 2]].
Now we will find MAX 6 1 8 6 = 8 and SM 1 9 1 2 = 3
Substitute these results back into the equation:

[SM 8 8 4 3].
And finally we got SM 8 8 4 3 = 23 to get the final single digit output SM 23= 3

[SM [MAX 4 3 0 5] 4 [MIN 2 9 5 6] 9] => SM [5, 4, 2, 9] => 0 (because the sum 20 mod 10 is 0)
[MAX 2 [SM 1 6 4 6] [MAX 6 9 8 6] 0] => MAX [2, 7, 9, 0] => 9
[MIN 1 5 4 3] => 1
[MIN 1 0 6 8] => 0
[SM 3 4 5 4] => 6 (because the sum 16 mod 10 is 6)

So, the original expression becomes

[MAX 5 [SM 0 9 6 9] 1 [SM [MAX 1 2 4 9] 9 7 [MIN 0 6 1 5]]].

Next, evaluate the next layer of nested expressions:

[SM 0 9 6 9] => 4 (because the sum 24 mod 10 is 4)
[MAX 1 2 4 9] => 9
[MIN 0 6 1 5] => 0

The expression then becomes

[MAX 5 4 1 [SM 9 9 7 0]].

Then again evaluate the inner-most expression:

[SM 9 9 7 0] => 5 (since the sum is 25 mod 10)

The expression then becomes

[MIN 3 1 3 1] -> MIN(3,1,3,1) = 1

[MAX 6 0 4 6] -> MAX(6,0,4,6) = 6

[MAX 3 5 3 9] -> MAX(3,5,3,9) = 9

[MIN 3 5 3 2] -> MIN(3,5,3,2) = 2

[MAX 9 0 1 5] -> MAX(9,0,1,5) = 9

Now replacing these values:

Now calculate the remaining MAX blocks:

[MAX 3 5 2 [MAX 1 4 1 0]] -> MAX(3,5,2,MAX(1,4,1,0)) = MAX(3,5,2,4) = 5 

[MAX 1 2 [SM 1 0 0 3] 4] -> MAX(1,2,SM(1,0,0,3),4) = MAX(1,2,4,4) = 4

[MAX 6] = 6

[MAX 9] = 9

Replacing these values, we have:

Now calculate the remaining MIN blocks:

[MIN 6 0 0 9] -> MIN(6,0,0,9) = 0

So, the updated expression becomes:

[SM 6 6 [SM 5 9 4 5] [MAX 0 2 [MAX 0 2 9 0] 0]]

Now calculate the remaining MAX blocks:

[MAX 0 2 [MAX 0 2 9 0] 0] -> MAX(0,2,MAX(0,2,9,0),0) = MAX(0,2,9,0) = 9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we calculate the operations inside the square nesting brackets:

[MIN 2 3 8 1] = 1
[MIN 4 7 8 2] = 2
[MIN 2 8 2 5] = 2
[SM 5 0 2 2] = 9
[MAX 0 2 1 3] = 3
[SM 6 0 4 2] = 2 (6 + 0 + 4 + 2 = 12; 12 mod 10 = 2)
[SM 6 9 9 1] = 5 (6 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 25; 25 mod 10 = 5)

So, the expression becomes:

[SM [MAX 8 [SM 0 [SM 4 8 9 7] 1 0] 6 [SM 9 2 4 2]] 3 [MIN 9 [SM 9 2 9 3] [MAX 9 2 6 5] 2] 5]

Then the operations inside round brackets:

[SM 4 8 9 7] = 8 (4 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 28; 28 mod 10 = 8)

So, the expression becomes:

[SM [MAX 8 [SM 0 8 1 0] 6 [SM 9 2 4 2]] 3 [MIN 9 [SM 9 2 9 3] [MAX 9 2 6 5] 2] 5]

Then, we calculate the operations inside [MAX ...] and [MIN ...]:

[MAX 8 [SM 0 8 1 0] 6 [SM 9 2 4 2]] = 9
[MIN 9 [SM 9 2 9 3] [MAX 9 2 6 5] 2] = 2

So, the expression becomes:

[SM 9 3 2 5]

Finally, we calculate the sum modulo 10:

[SM 9 3 2 5] = 9 (9 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 19; 19 mod 10 = 9)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the internal SM's:
[SM 8 5 7 9] is equivalent to (8+5+7+9) MOD 10 = 29 MOD 10 = 9.
[SM 0 4 9 5] is equivalent to (0+4+9+5) MOD 10 = 18 MOD 10 = 8.
[SM 9 0 8 7] is equivalent to (9+0+8+7) MOD 10 = 24 MOD 10 = 4.
Replace these SM's in the original expression:
[MAX 1 [MAX 4 [MIN 9 3 3 [MAX 1 0 9 6]] 7 [SM 7 8 [MAX 4 5 8 4] 6]] 6 [MIN [MAX [MAX 0 7 9 9] [MAX 3 6 2 6] 1 4] 6 1 [SM 8 [MIN 7 4 9 8] 4 5]]].
Now solve the internal MAX's and MIN's:
[MAX 4 [MIN 9 3 3 [MAX 1 0 9 6]] is equivalent to MAX 4 MIN 9 3 3 9 = MAX 4 3 = 4.
[MAX 0 7 9 9] can be reduced to 9.
[MAX 3 6 2 6] can be reduced to 6.
[MAX 4 5 8 4] can be reduced to 8.
[MIN 7 4 9 8] can be reduced to 4.
Replace these values in the original expression:
[MAX 1 4 7 [SM 7 8 8 6] 6 [MIN 9 6 1 4] 6 1 [SM 8 4 4 5]].
Continue with SM:
[SM 7 8 8 6] is equivalent to (7+8+8+6) MOD 10 = 29 MOD 10 = 9.
[SM 8 4 4 5] is equivalent to (8+4+4+5) MOD 10 = 21 MOD 10 = 1.
Substitute these values in the expression: 
[MAX 1 4 7 9 6 [MIN 9 6 1 4] 6 1 1].
In this case, [MIN 9 6 1 4] can be reduced to 1.
Substitute this value in the expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, for each list where the operation MIN is called, the smallest value is chosen. 

For the block [MIN 7 0 3 6], the smallest number is '0'.
So [MIN 7 0 3 6] = 0.

For the block [MIN 0 0 9 5], the smallest number is '0'.
So [MIN 0 0 9 5] = 0.

For the block [MIN 3 8 [SM 9 6 9 3] [MIN 3 6 2 6]], the smallest number must be selected. 
But before that, we have to solve [SM 9 6 9 3] and [MIN 3 6 2 6]. 

For [SM 9 6 9 3], the sum of the numbers is '27', and as the operation is SM, 27 modulo 10 = 7. So [SM 9 6 9 3] = 7.

Regarding [MIN 3 6 2 6], the smallest number is '2'. So [MIN 3 6 2 6] = 2.

Now substituting the calculated values back to [MIN 3 8 [SM 9 6 9 3] [MIN 3 6 2 6]], we get [MIN 3 8 7 2]. The smallest number here is '2'. 
So [MIN 3 8 [SM 9 6 9 3] [MIN 3 6 2 6]] = 2.

Now, for the block [MIN 8 2 3 1], the smallest number is '1'.
So [MIN 8 2 3 1] = 1.

For the block [MIN 9 2 0 0], the smallest number is '0'.
So [MIN 9 2 0 0] = 0.

And for [MIN 8 6 6 6], the smallest number is '6'. 
So [MIN 8 6 6 6] = 6.

Now, we got the outputs for each MIN operator which can substitute on the main formula.

Let's substitute these values and solve the rest of the equation.

[MAX [SM [MIN [MIN 7 0 3 6] [MIN 0 0 9 5] 7 0] 4 [MIN 3 8 [SM 9 6 9 3] [MIN 3 6 2 6]] 5] 8 [SM [SM 5 7 [MIN 8 2 3 1] [SM 5 6 2 3]] 5 [MIN [MIN 9 2 0 0] 5 4 [MIN 8 6 6 6]] 1] 0].

Substituting the values, we get:

[MAX [SM 0 0 7 0] 4 2 5] 8 [SM [SM 5 7 1 [SM 5 6 2 3]] 5 [MIN 0 5 4 6] 1] 0].

Which can be simplified as:

[MAX [SM 7] 4 2 5] 8 [SM [SM 5 7 1 [SM 5 6 2 3]] 5 0 1] 0].

Again, [SM 7] will result in '7' because it's a single number. 

And [SM 5 7 1 [SM 5 6 2 3]] needs to be calculated.

[SM 5 6 2 3] equals (5+6+2+3) modulo 10 = 16 modulo 10 = '6'. 

Substituting back to the formula corresponding to [SM 5 7 1 [SM 5 6 2 3]], 
[SM 5 7 1 6] = (5+7+1+6) modulo 10 = 19 modulo 10 = '9'. 

Substitute the values back to the main formula :

[MAX 7 4 2 5] 8 [SM 9 5 0 1] 0.

The maximum value in [MAX 7 4 2 5] is '7'. 

[SM 
9 5 0 1] would be (9+5+0+1) modulo 10 = 15 modulo 10 = '5'. 

Substitute these values back gives:

7 8 5 0.

We've finally arrived at a list of single-digit numbers. Considering that there are no operators left, the output must also be a list of single-digit numbers. This solution corresponds to the original formula's output.

So the final answer for the given expression is [7 8 5 0].",[7 8 5 0],8

- ""MAX 0 1 3 0"" would be 3, which is the largest number.
- ""SM 4 9 3 3"" would be (4 + 9 + 3 + 3), which equals 19. But because this is a ""SM"" operation, we would take the sum modulo 10. The result is 9.
- ""MAX 9 2 0 9"" would be 9, the largest number.
- ""MAX 7 5 3 7"" also would be 7.
- ""MAX 5 9 7 2"" would be 9.

[MAX 7 5 3 5] = max(7, 5, 3, 5) = 7

[SM 2 2 2 7] = (2 + 2 + 2 + 7) mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3

[MAX 6 8 1 1] = max(6, 8, 1, 1) = 8

The expression becomes...

Next, solve for the new SM and MAX operations:

[SM 9 6 4 8] = (9 + 6 + 4 + 8) mod 10 = 27 mod 10 = 7

[MAX 8 2 9 8] = max(8, 2, 9, 8) = 9

[MAX 7 9 7 4] = max(7, 9, 7, 4) = 9

[SM 3 5 9 8] = (3 + 5 + 9 + 8) mod 10 = 25 mod 10 = 5

Our expression becomes...

Evaluate the remaining MIN, MAX and SM operations:

[MIN 7 9 5 9] = min(7, 9, 5, 9) = 5

[SM 8 9 3 5] = (8 + 9 + 3 + 5) mod 10 = 25 mod 10 = 5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Identify and solve all the innermost lists first:

   For example, in SM 7 [MIN 0 8 7 6] 0, the list MIN 0 8 7 6 = 0. So, it becomes SM 7 0 0, which is SM 7, amounting to 7.

   Similarly, [MAX 3 7 1 2] = 7,

   [MAX 7 9 8 1] = 9,

   [SM 4 2 6 0] = 2 (12 mod 10),

   [MAX 2 [MAX [SM 8 6 5 0] 6 6 [MIN 9 4 9 6]] 4 [MIN 3 6 [SM 2 5 3 6] [MIN 4 9 0 8]]]

   Here, solve [SM 8 6 5 0] = 9 (19 mod 10),

   [MIN 9 4 9 6] = 4,

   [SM 2 5 3 6] = 6 (16 mod 10),

   [MIN 4 9 0 8] = 0,

   So, it becomes: 
   [MAX 2 [MAX 9 6 4] 4 [MIN 3 6 6 0]] = [MAX 2 9 4 6] = 9

2. Now, replace all these solutions back into the initial equation:

   [MAX [SM 7 0 7] [MAX 4 9 2 3] 1 6] 1 4 9
   => [MAX [SM 14] [MAX 9] 1 6] 1 4 9
   => [MAX 4 1 6] 1 4 9   
   => [MAX 6] 1 4 9

Second, solve the SM operations:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, you have to calculate each operator inside brackets from innermost to outermost and left to right.

1. Calculate the innermost SM operations:
- SM [5 5 2 2] results in 4, because the sum of these numbers is 14 and 14 mod 10 equals 4.
- SM [0 3 8 6] results in 7, because the sum of these numbers is 17 and 17 mod 10 equals 7.
- SM [3 1 6 1] results in 1, because the sum of these numbers is 11 and 11 mod 10 equals 1.

So the expression turned into

- MAX [9 0 6 6] results in 9.
- MIN [1 3 2 3] results in 1.
- MAX [4 5 5 0] results in 5.
- MAX [2 5 4 6] results in 6.
- MIN [2 9 6 4] results in 2.

So the expression turned into
MAX [MIN [4 6 7 6] 0 [SM [1 6 4 9] 8] [MAX [MAX 1 5 2] 7 6 [MAX 6 [2 2 7] 7]] 0 8] .

3. Apply the SM operation and get 
MAX [MIN [4 6 7 6] 0 0 8] [MAX [MAX 1 5 2] 7 6 7 7] .

4. Now get the minimum and maximum of the lists in the inner brackets:
- MIN [4 6 7 6] results in 4.
- MAX [1 5 2] results in 5.

2. MIN [7 5 2 2] = MIN [2].

3. MAX [ 6 7 0 0] = MAX [7].

So the equation becomes:

Then we compute the expressions with the MIN and MAX operators. MIN and MAX return the smallest and the largest values in the list correspondingly.

- MIN 0 4 6 0 = 0
- MAX 8 8 7 1 = 8
- MIN 4 6 7 6 = 4
- MIN 9 7 5 1 = 1
- MIN 4 7 8 0 = 0
- MAX 7 1 4 9 = 9

Substituting these values in, we get:
MAX [MIN 7 [MAX 6 1 1 0] [SM 8 4 0 2] 3] 9 0 [MIN [MIN 1 7 6 2] 8 9 [MAX 0 9 2 0]]

Re-calculating the inner expressions with SM, MIN, and MAX operators, we get:

- MAX 6 1 1 0 = 6
- MIN 1 7 6 2 = 1
- MAX 0 9 2 0 = 9

Substituting these values in, we get:

- MIN 1 8 9 9 = 1

Substituting these values in, we get:

7. [MIN 1 1 9 9] is 1 because MIN operator selects the least value in the list.
8. [MIN 7 8 8 8] is 7 because MIN operator selects the least value in the list.

9. [MIN 0 2 7 4] is 0 because MIN operator selects the least value in the list.
10. [SM 1 6 0] is 7 because SM operator sums all the numbers in the list and then takes modulo 10 result, i.e. (1+6+0) mod 10 = 7 mod 10 = 7.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's solve the nested operator inside the MIN operator and try to make it more simple:
CALCULATING INSIDE (MIN) OPERATOR - 

[MIN 6 7 0 6] will give the smallest number, which is 0.

[MAX 2 0 1 6] will give the largest number, which is 6.

Next, we perform the (SM) operation, [SM 0 7 3 6] = 16 % 10 (Because SM is sum modulo 10) = 6.

Similarly, [MAX 6 0 2 7] = 7

[MAX 7 0 6 5] = 7

So, [SM 9 7 7 1 6 1] = 31 % 10 = 1.

Thus, the left part inside (MIN) operator simplifies to [MIN 6 1].

Now calculating the nested operator inside right part of MIN operator -

[MAX 8 2 4 3] will give the largest number, which is 8.

[SM 6 6 2 3] = 17 % 10 = 7.

The nested operator [MAX [MAX 8 2 4 3] 0 3 7] results in 8.

Similarly, [MAX 6 3 9 5] gives 9.

[SM 5 6 0 6] gives 7.

[MAX [MAX 6 3 9 5] 7 9 1] gives 9.

So the right part of the (MIN) operator is [MIN 1 8 9 0]

MAX returns the maximum from the given numbers.

[Max 1 4 9 0] = 9

Next, we simplify:

MIN 3 1 5 8 = 1

SM 9 5 = (9 + 5) mod 10 = 14 mod 10 = 4

[SM 0 7 3 8] -> Summing and modulo 10, we get 8.

For the sum operations, we add the values together and find their modulus 10.

SM 1 7 2 9 = (1 + 7 + 2 + 9) % 10 = 9

For the maximum values, we choose the highest numbers.
MAX 9 5 3 6 = 9
MAX 6 7 6 5 = 7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, evaluate non-nested terms from inner to outer.

[SM 4 7 0 7] is calculated as (4+7+0+7) modulo 10 because SM is modulo 10 sum. It equals 8.

[MAX 5 3 3 8] is calculated as the maximum value from numbers 5, 3, 3, and 8. It equals 8.

These are substituted in the outer expression [MIN [MAX 6 [SM 4 7 0 7] [MAX 5 3 3 8] 3], and results in [MIN [MAX 6 8 8 3]

[MAX 6 8 8 3] is calculated as maximum value amongst numbers 6, 8, 8, and 3. That gives us 8.

This is substituted back to the outer expression [MIN 8 1 5], which is calculated as the minimum value between 8, 1, and 5. It gives us result of 1.

Simultaneously, 

[SM 6 4 7 1] = (6+4+7+1) modulo 10 = 8

[SM 0 7 5 7] = (0+7+5+7) modulo 10 = 9

These are substituted into the expression [MIN [SM 6 4 7 1] 5 [SM 0 7 5 7] 1] = [MIN 8 5 9 1] = 1

Also, 
[SM 3 5 7 7] = (3+5+7+7) modulo 10 = 2
[MIN 9 1 3 2] = minimum value amongst 9, 1, 3, and 2 = 1

These are substituted into the expression [MIN 2 [SM 3 5 7 7] [MIN 9 1 3 2] 2] = [MIN 2 2 1 2] = 1

Substitute these into the expression [MIN [MIN [SM 6 4 7 1] 5 [SM 0 7 5 7] 1] 9 0 [MIN 2 [SM 3 5 7 7] [MIN 9 1 3 2] 2]] = [MIN 1 9 0 1] = 0

3) For [SM 8 5 5 2], we will add all the numbers i.e. 8+5+5+2 = 20 and taking only the units place, the number becomes 0.
4) For [SM 8 0 2 4], we will add all the numbers i.e. 8+0+2+4 = 14 and taking only the units place, the number becomes 4.

Now our equation will look like this:

[MAX [MAX 9 [SM 7 0 2 7] 8 7 9] 4 [MIN [SM 9 9 9 1] 1 0 0 4] 1].

Now we can further clear the brackets. Now in the first set of brackets of 2nd degree we have:

[SM 7 0 2 7].

We will apply the rules to solve this. We will add all the numbers i.e. 7+0+2+7 = 16 and taking only the units place, the number becomes 6.

And similarly in the second set of brackets of 2nd degree we have:

[SM 9 9 9 1].

We will apply the rules to solve this. We will add all the numbers i.e. 9+9+9+1 = 28 and taking only the units place, the number becomes 8.

[SM 9 9 9 1] becomes 8.

Now our equation is:

[MAX [MAX 9 6 8 7 9] 4 [MIN 8 1 0 0 4] 1].

Now we need to solve the brackets of 3rd degree to further simplify out equation. 

First we have [MAX 9 6 8 7 9] which returns 9 after applying the MAX operator.

Then we have [MIN 8 1 0 0 4] which returns 0 after applying the MIN operator.

Now our equation is:

[MAX 9 4 0 1].

And finally applying the MAX operator on this expression returns 9.

Therefore, the answer to the given problem is 9.",9,9

Solve the following expression involving these operators:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The inner operations are, SM 8 1 5 7 gives 3 since their sum is 21 and sum modulo 10 is 21%10=1
The result is MAX[MIN[MAX 3 [MAX 7 6 2 1] 0 21] 3 [SM 6 7 [MIN 3 7 7 8] [SM 5 3 2 8]] 1].

Then [MAX 7 6 2 1] gives 7.
The result is [MAX [MIN [MAX 3 7 0 1] 3 [SM 6 7 [MIN 3 7 7 8] [SM 5 3 2 8]] 1].
Then, [MAX 3 7 0 1] gives 7. 
The result is [MAX [MIN 7 3 [SM 6 7 [MIN 3 7 7 8] [SM 5 3 2 8]] 1].

Also, [MIN 3 7 7 8] gives 3. Also [SM 5 3 2 8] gives 18%10=8. 
So the result is [MAX [MIN 7 3 [SM 6 7 3 8]] 1].

On calculating [SM 6 7 3 8], we get 24%10=4.
It gives [MAX [MIN 7 3 4] 1].

Then, [MIN 7 3 4] gives 3.
So, it gives, [MAX 3 1].

Then, [MAX 3 1] gives 3.

Performing the same calculations for the second part of equation.
MAX [SM 3 [MIN 4 [MAX 4 6 0 1] 1] 9 [SM [MIN 2 4 2 8] 3 6 [MAX 8 5 8 6]]] 0 5]

[MIN 4 [MAX 4 6 0 1] 1] gives MIN [4 6 1], which is 1.
So, [SM 3 [MIN 4 [MAX 4 6 0 1] 1] 9 [SM [MIN 2 4 2 8] 3 6 [MAX 8 5 8 6]]] 0 5] equals [SM 3 1 9 [SM [MIN 2 4 2 8] 3 6 [MAX 8 5 8 6]]] 0 5].

So, SM[3 1 9] equals 13%10 = 3.
So, the result is [MAX 3 [SM [MIN 2 4 2 8] 3 6 [MAX 8 5 8 6]]] 0 5].

The calculation of [MIN 2 4 2 8] gives 2.
So, it equalises to [MAX 3 [SM 2 3 6 [MAX 8 5 8 6]]] 0 5].

The calculation of [MAX 8 5 8 6] gives 8.
So, the whole equation equals to [MAX 3 [SM 2 3 6 8]] 0 5].

Then, [SM 2 3 6 8] gives 19%10 = 9.
So, the left side equals to [MAX 3 9 0 5].

Finally, MAX[3 9 0 5] equals 9.

Comparing the result with the result from first half, we get the answer as the maximum among 3 & 9 i.e., 9.",9,5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's calculate the inner expressions we can evaluate. These are:
- MAX 9 2 2 6 = 9
- MAX 7 2 7 8 = 8
- SM 2 8 7 6 = 23 (but since this is modulo 10 we have 3)
- MIN 2 9 2 8 = 2
- MAX 6 [MIN 7 9 2 0] 6 [MIN 5 2 1 7] = MAX 6 0 6 1 = 6
- SM 9 2 4 4 = 19 (but this is modulo 10 so 9)
- MAX 1 [SM 9 2 4 4] 2 [MAX 4 4 3 5] = MAX 1 9 2 5 = 9

So the expression becomes:

[MAX [MIN [MAX 0 8 9 8] [SM 3 4 2 3] 6 8] 1 [MIN 6 2 9 1] 1]

Next, we can calculate the following expressions:
- MAX 0 8 9 8 = 9
- SM 3 4 2 3 = 12 (modulo 10, we have 2)
- MIN 6 2 9 1 = 1

So, we obtain:

[MAX [MIN 9 2 6 8] 1 1 1]

Next:
- MIN 9 2 6 8 = 2

So we have:

[MAX 2 1 1 1]

And finally:
- MAX 2 1 1 1 = 2

So, the value of the whole expression is 2.",2,2
