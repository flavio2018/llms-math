A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any statement 'disjoined' with True (statement | T) is always True, because either the statement is True or anyway True is True. Therefore, (k|T), (m|F), ((m&m)|(m|F)) and (F&(l|T)) simplify to T.

2. Any statement 'anded' with False (statement & F) is always False, because both statements need to be True for the result to be True and False is not True. But we do not seem to have such cases here.

3. Any statement 'disjoined' with False (statement | F) is always the same statement, because False does not contribute to making the or-statement True. But we have already handled such cases in step 1.

4. Any statement 'anded' with True (statement & T) is always the same statement, because True does not prevent the statement from being True in the and-case. Therefore, (F&T) simplifies to F.

5. Any statement or its negation 'disjoined' with the statement itself ((statement | !statement) or (!statement | statement)) is always True, but we do not seem to have such cases here.

6. Any statement and its negation 'anded' ((statement & !statement) or (!statement & statement)) is always False, but we do not seem to have such cases here.

- T & F evaluates to F.
- T | F evaluates to T.
- F | F evaluates to F.
- n & F evaluates to F (where n is any literal).

Substitute these evaluations back into the formula:

This simplifies to:

- ((g & (n & F)) & F).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that the ""or"" operation between any statement and False will always yield that statement. Thus, (f|F) = f. Therefore, on the first iteration, let's replace all (f|F) with f.

-> (f&(((f|((f&f)&((f&T)|F)))|f)&(f&(!F))))&(F|(z|T))).

Second, we know that the ""and"" operation between any statement and its negation (!) is always False. Thus, (!F&F) is always False. Therefore, replace (f&(!F)) with False.

(f&(((f|((f&f)&((f&T)|F)))|f)&(f&(!F))))&(F|(z|T))) 
-> (f&((f|((f&f)&(f|F)))|f))&(F|(z|T))).

Next, the ""and"" operation between any statement and True will always yield that statement. Thus, (f&T) = f. Replace all (f&T) with f. 

(f&((f|((f&f)&(f|F)))|f))&(F|(z|T))) 
-> (f&((f|((f&f)&f))|f))&(F|(z|T))). 

Also, the ""and"" operation between any statement and False will always yield False. Thus, (f&F) = F. Replace all (f&F) with F. 

(f&((f|((f&f)&f))|f))&(F|(z|T)))

(f&((f|(f&f))|f))&(F|(z|T)))
-> (f&((f|f)|f))&(F|(z|T)).

The ""or"" operation between any statement and itself is always that statement. Meaning, (f|f) = f. Thus, replace all (f|f) with f.

(f&((f|f)|f))&(F|(z|T)) 
-> (f&(f|f))&(F|(z|T)) 
-> (f&f)&(F|(z|T))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's recall the basic of the logical operations:

- The negation of True (!T) is False (F), and the negation of False (!F) is True (T).

4. Since the expression from step 2 simplifies to T. And propagating its values, ((f & T) | T) becomes T, and (T | F) is also T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the innermost brackets.
1. (T|(!(!F))) simplifies to (T|T), because logical not of False (!F) is True, which again is (T). So, it is (T|T), which is True or True, and that is T.
2. ((k|k)&(k&k))|T simplifies to T, because logical or with True (any|T) is always True (T).

So, the expression now is:
((!((!T)&F))|(!((F|T)&T))).

Further simplification results in:
1. ((!T)&F) simplifies to F, because logical not of True (!T) is False and logical and of anything with False (any&F) is always False (F). So, it is F.
2. (F|T)&T simplifies to T, because logical or of anything with True (any|T) is always True (T). So, it is T.

So, the expression is:
((!F)|(!T)).

Last simplification results in:
1. (!F) simplifies to True (T), because logical not of False is True (T).
2. (!T) simplifies to False (F), because logical not of True is False (F).

Therefore, final simplified expression becomes:

2. y|F will be y because the OR statement will be True if at least one is True.

4. !(!F) will be T because the NOT operation will reverse the initial value.
5. y|y will just be y because it's the same statement.

Using these facts let's break down the statement:

((y|(F&T))&(((y|((y|F)|((y|y)|((y&T)&(F|T)))))|(!(!F)))|F)) can be simplified to
((y|F)&((y|((y|y)|(y&T)))|T)) where we just simplify inner brackets first.

((y|F)&((y|y)|T)) because y&T will always be y.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the expressions where we have False (F) and True (T) values.

1. Any logical OR operation with False results in the original value. This means that (n|F) simplifies to n

2. Similarly, a logical AND operation with False yields False. Therefore, (F&T) simplifies to F

3. Likewise, a logical NOT operation can reverse the value of F and T. For example, !F simplifies to T

4. Logical AND operations with True do not change the original value. Thus, (T&n) simplifies to n

5. A logical AND operation between any value and False always yields False. Therefore, the expression (n&F) simplifies to F

6. Lastly, a logical OR operation with True ALWAYS results in True. This means that (n|T) simplifies to T

Applying the rules 

We have the original formula

((n&((((n|((n|F)&n))&n)|F)|(F|((j&(F&(!F)))|T))))&((F&T)&T))

Step 1:  We simplify (n|F)&n, F&(!F) and (F&T)&T to n&n , F and F respectively.

We get

((n&((((n|(n&n))&n)|F)|(F|((j&F)|T))))&F)

Step 2: We simplify n&n, (j&F) and ((n|(n&n))&n|F) to n, F and n|F that is n.

We get

((n&((n|F)|(F|T)))&F)

Step 3 : Then, we simplify n|F to n and ((n|F)|(F|T)) to (n|T) that is T. 

We get

((n&T)&F)

Step 4 : We simplify n&T to n 

We get 

(n&F)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, replace T and F in the formula.
Because T represents True, the result of T or anything, and T and anything would be True.
Because F represents False, the result of F and anything would be False.

Step 1: Replace (!T) with F, T or T with T, T and T with T, F or T with T, and F and anything with F. 
This simplifies the formula to ((!F)|(((T&T)&!T)&T)|F))&(T|((!F)|T)).
 
Step 2: Now let's simplify the inner formula.

This simplifies the formula to (F|((T&F)&T)|F)&(T|((F)|T)).
 
Step 3: Now let's simplify rest of the formula. 
Because T and F is F, F or F is F, and F or T is T, following the same replacement scheme. 
This simplifies the formula to (F|F)&(T|F).

Step 4: Now let's simplify the final formula. 
F or F is F, T or F is T, following the same replacement scheme.

3. Therefore, ((T&(T&T))&T) simplifies to T because any number of AND T operations will result in T.
4. Now, let's look at (!(T&((T&(T&T))&T))). Since we have simplified ((T&(T&T))&T) to T, !(T&((T&(T&T))&T)) simplifies to !T, which means NOT TRUE, equals False. 
5. Now, look at the expression (((T&(((F|T)&T)|F))|F)|T)). Since (F|T) simplifies to T as per step 1, (((F|T)&T)|F) simplifies to T (as we have True AND True). Thus (((T&(True))|F)|T) simplifies to T because any number of OR T or AND T operations will result in T.
6. Therefore, the entire expression ((q|(((T&(((F|T)&T)|F))|F)|T))|(!(T|(!(T&((T&(T&T))&T)))))) simplifies to (q|T|False). This then simplifies to just T because this means TRUE OR q OR FALSE, and anything OR T will be T.

Furthermore, anything or'd (|) with True (T) is always True. But, we don't have something like that in this expression.

Substituting these simplifications, we get:

q&F simplifies to F. The expression is now (F&(F&(!(F|(!((s&(s|s))&F)))))).

Next, consider F&T, which is False and True. Because one of the literals is false, the whole expression is false. This simplifies to False. We can replace F&T in the formula with False.

Substitute these results back to the given formula.

The simplified formula would be: 

((((r&(T|(T|(((T&T)&(T&T))|T))))|r)&(F&((False&False)|T))).

(T&T)&(T&T) is the same as True and True which simplifies to True. 

As a result, the given formula simplifies to:

Furthermore, the expression True|T or True or True would simplifies to True. Accordingly, we can replace (T|(T|(True|T))) in the given formula with T.

Substitute this result back to the formula:

Step 7: Simplify (!(F&!True))

        = (!((T)&((v&F)|(((F|(p|(True)))|F)&((p|(p&(True)))|T)))))
         Here, !F is True and (x|T) is True as anything OR True is True.

Step 2: (!((T)&((v&F)|(((F|(p|True))|F)&((p|(p&True))|T)))))
       = (!((T)&((F)|(((F|(p|True))|F)&((p|(p&True))|T)))))
         Here, v&F is False as anything AND False is False.

Step 3: (!((T)&((F)|(((F|(p|True))|F)&((p|(p&True))|T)))))
       = (!((T)&((F)|((True)&((p|(p&True))|T))))) 
         Substituting F|(p|True) becomes True as anything OR True is True. 

Step 4: (!((T)&((F)|((True)&((p|(p&True))|T)))))
       = (!((T)&((F)|(True))))
         Since p|(p&True) equates p itself as anything OR'd with its own AND with True remains itself. And p|T is True as anything OR True is True. 

Step 5: (!((T)&((F)|(True))))
       = (!((T)&(True)))
          Since anything OR True is True.

Step 6: (!((T)&(True)))
       = (!T)
          Simplified T AND T is T.

The simplified logic formula is !T or equivalently F.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F))|r)&F) can be simplified as:
- (r|F) because the addition of F (False) in a logical OR does not affect the outcome.
- (T&F) is always F because both values must be true in a logical AND for the result to be true.
- Hence, ((r|F)|(T&F)) is equivalent to(r|F) which, given what we just established, is equivalent to r.
- (!F) is always T (True) because it negates F.
- Therefore, this AND function is always false when one operand is false, ((r|F)&(!F))|r will simplify to (r&T)|r which is r|r. Any value logic OR itself is always itself so r|r will be r.
- ((r | r) & F)) will yield F because anything AND False is False. 

2. (g|g) does not affect the result since it's the same expression and in logical OR operation it will be g itself.
3. (g|(g&(!F)))&T for simplification:
- (!F) will become T. 
- Hence, (g|g&T) which will become g since anything OR True is always True
- And, g&T will become g as anything AND True is itself.

Therefore, the whole ((g|g)|((g|(((((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F))|r)&F))|((g|(g&(!F)))&T))) will be simplified as (g|F|g) which is g only, because anything OR False returns itself and g OR g is always g.",g,g

3. The or operator where one operand is False means that the result is whatever the other operand is. This means we can simplify o|F into o.

The 'T&F' simplifies to F and 'F&F' simplifies to F. Substituting:

(T&((v|F)&(F|(e&(F|F)))))

The 'v|F' simplifies to v (Anything OR False is that thing itself) and 'F|F' simplifies to F. Substituting:

(T&(v&(F|(e&F))))

The 'e&F' simplifies to F (Anything AND False is False) and 'F|(e&F)' simplifies to F. Substituting:

Second, we have an AND operation (&) involving the value F (False). In this case, the resultant value will always be False, regardless of the other operand. So, we can simplify ((T|((i|(m|T))|T))&F) to F.

Third, we have an AND operation (&) involving f and the value T (True). This will be equal to whichever value that 'f' represents. So, we can simplify (f&T) to f and (f&(f&T)) to f.

Lastly, we have a situation where the OR operation is being applied between 'f' and any operation involving 'f'. In these cases, the resulting value will always be equivalent to 'f'. Therefore, we can simplify the formula (((f&f)|F)&f) to f and (f|(f&(((f&(f&T))|F)&f))) to f.

2. Similarly, by applying the same Idempotent law we can simplify (T|T) to 'T'.

3. Any logical value OR'd with FALSE(i.e., (X|F)) results in 'X' itself, since FALSE doesn't change the original value. We could apply this rule to (q|F), (c|F) and (T|F) to simplify them to 'q', 'c' and 'T', respectively.

5. Any logical value AND'd with itself(i.e., (X&X)) is always itself(MPI/Idempotent Law). Similarly, any logical value OR'd with itself(i.e., (X|X)) is always 'X' itself. This is applicable for 'T' in current formula.

6. Application of Identity law : Any logical value 'X' AND'd with 'TRUE' results 'X' itself. So final formula becomes :

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's break this down:

(((x&(((x|F)&T)|x))&((x&((((x&T)&(v|T))|(F&T))&T))|F))&(F&F)).

Simplify, the logical OR operation with False doesn't do anything: 

(((x&((x&T)|x))&((x&(((x&T)&v)|(F&T))&T))|F))&(F&F).

Simplify, the logical AND operation with True doesn't do anything:

(((x&(x|x))&((x&((x&v)|F)&T))|F))&(F&F).

Simplify the logical OR operation with itself doesn't do anything:

((x&((x&((x&v)|F))|F))&(F&F)).

Simplify, the logical AND operation with False results in False:

(((x&(x&((x&v)&T)))|F))&(F&F).

Simplify, the logical AND operation with True doesn't do anything:

((((x&x)&(x&v))|F))&(F&F).

AND operation with itself doesn't change anything:

(((x&(x&v))|F))&(F&F).

Simplify, the logical AND operation with False results in False:

(x&(x&v))&F.

Simplify, anything AND with False is just False:

F.

So, after simplifying the given logic formula, it is reduced to a simple False or 'F'.",F,F

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(!((T&((!(f&((q&T)&F)))&F))&(!(!((((T&T)&F)&F)&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. In logic, any statement AND with False is equivalent to False, no matter what the statement is. Therefore, ((q&T)&F) simplifies to F. Also, ((T&T)&F) simplifies to F.

   The expression now looks like this:
   
   (!((T&((!(f&F))&F))&(!(!((F&F)&T))))).

2. The ! operator (logical not) switches the values of True and False and vice versa. Here, we have !(F), which is True.

   The expression is simplified to:
   
   (!((T&((!f)&F))&(!(!(F&T))))).

3. Here we need to use De Morgan's laws, which states that the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations and the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations. So, the ""not"" operation before the brackets can be distributed over the terms in the brackets: !(a&b) is equivalent to (!a|!b). 

   The expression is simplified to:
   
   ((!T|!(F))|((!((F&T))))).

4. By using the rules from steps 1 and 2 again about and with False and not of False, we can simplify to:

   ((!T|T)|(!T)).

5. A statement OR with True is equivalent to True. So both (!T|T) and (T|!T) will simplify to True. 

   The expression is simplified to:

   (T|T).

6. The final simplification is to True.

So, the simplification of the original logic formula is True.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical 'and' (&) operation with any value 'v' and itself is equal to 'v'. So, (m & m) == m
The logical 'or' (|) operation with any value 'v' and False (F) is equal to 'v'. So, (m | F) == m
The logical 'not' (!) operation negates the value. So, (!F) == T
The logical 'or' (|) operation with True (T) and any other value 'v' is always True. So, (T | (!F)) == T
The logical 'and' (&) operation with any value 'v' and True is equal to 'v'. So, (T & (T | (!F))) == T
The logical 'and' (&) operation with False (F) and any other value 'v' is always False. So, ((F | (F & T)) == F and (F & T) == F
The logical 'or' (|) operation with any value 'v' and False (F) is equal to 'v'. So, ((T & ((F | (F & T)) & T)) | F) == F
The logical 'and' (&) operation with any value 'v' and False (F) is always False. So, (((T & ((F | (F & T)) & T)) | F) & F) == F
Finally, the logical 'or' (|) operation with any value 'v' and itself is equal to 'v'. So, (m | m) == m

Then, insert the simplified terms into the original formula:
(((((m&m)|m)|F)|((((T&(T|(!F)))&((F|(F&T))&T))|F)&F))&(m|m))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly,: 
(F|T) and (F|(F|T)) are always T (as anything Or True is always True)

((T&F)|(T&F)) is F (anything And False is always False); 

((T&F)&T) is always F, 

But (False or True) and (F or T) are always T.

So, the original expression simplifies to:

((c | (c & T)) & (s | T)) 

This simplifies down to:

(c | s | T)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we notice that F & T = F (since false AND true = false). Hence, our formula simplifies to:

(v | F) & v & (((v | F) & (v | F | T | F) | v) & v).

Next, we know that v | F = v (since v OR false = v). Let's simplify the above equation using this logical rule.

(v & v) & ((v & (v | T | F) | v) & v).

Since v & v is v (v and v = v), we can further simplify the above formula to:

v & ((v & (v | T | F) | v) & v).

Now, we know that any value ORed with 'false' or 'true' gives us 'true'. Hence, (v | T | F) is true. If we substitute this into the formula, we get:

v & ((v & true | v) & v).

Also, since 'v & true' is 'v', we get:

v & ((v | v) & v).

Since 'v | v' is 'v', we get:

v & (v & v).

Again using 'v & v' is 'v', we get:

v & v.

Finally, since 'v & v' is 'v', our simplified formula becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, note that T|F simplifies to True (since 'True OR False' is 'True') and T&T simplifies to True again. Another simplification we can do is that a literal AND with itself (like l&l) is just the literal itself (so l&l simplifies to l). So, 

l&((T|F)&(T&T)) simplifies to l&T, or just l (since 'l AND True' is just 'l').

Now, ((l&l)&(((l&l)&l)&((l&(l|l))&T))) simplifies to ((l&l)&(((l&l)&l)&(l&T))) which simplifies to ((l&l)&((l&l)&l)) which simplifies to (l&(l&l)) or just (l&l), which simplifies to l.

So, l|(l&T) simplifies to l|l, which simplifies to l.
