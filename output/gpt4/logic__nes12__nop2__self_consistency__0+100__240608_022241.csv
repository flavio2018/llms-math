A: Let's think step-by-step.","1st step, simplify (!T) and (!F):
(!T) equals to F
(!F) equals to T

So, the given formula becomes:
((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|T))|F))&T)|w))&((w&((F|(T&T))|T))|w))&(F|T))).

2nd step, simplify (F|T) and (T&T):
(F|T) equals to T (as T OR anything will be T)
(T&T) equals to T (as T AND T is T)

Now, the formula becomes:
((w|F)&((w|((w&((w|T)|F))&T)&((w|(F|T))|w))&T)).

3rd step, simplify any expression where w OR something:
(w|F) equals to w (as anything OR False will be the thing itself)
(w|T) equals to T (as anything OR True will be True)

Now, the formula becomes:
(w&((w|((w&F)&T)&T))).

4th step, if anything AND False, it will be False. So, ((w&F)&T) equals to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that !F equals T (since the negation of False is True), !T equals F (since the negation of True is False) and T|F equals T (since True or False is True).

Second, we know that anything OR True is also True (since if either part is True, the whole expression is True) and anything AND False is False (since if either part is False, the whole expression is False).

So let's start simplifying: 

(((!F)|F)|((((!((((F&(!(F&(d|T))))&F)&(!((F&(T|(T|F)))|F)))|T))|(!((T|T)|F)))|(!T))|F) 

First, replace all the !F and !T with T and F [respectively] and T|F with T;

= ((T|F)|((((!((((F&(!(F&d))&F)&(!(F|F))|T))|(T))|F)|F)).

Then, continue to simplify using AND and OR rules;

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, note that anything ANDed with False, denoted as F, equals False:
( F & anything ) equals False.

Then, note that anything ORed with True, denoted as T, equals True:
( T | anything ) equals True.

In addition, the negation of True or False are False and True respectively:
!T equals False.
!F equals True.

Lastly, anything ANDed with True or ORed with False remains unchanged:
False | anything = anything.
True & anything = anything.

We can now proceed to simplify step by step:

1. Simplify (F & (l & F)) to F, because anything ANDed with False equals False.

2. Simplify (F | T) to T because anything ORed with True equals True. 
Our formula now becomes: 

F & ((((u & ((((z & ((!T) | (s | T))) & z) | T) | F)) | u) & (!((t & (T | (T & (m | T)))) & t) & F))

3. Simplify (!T) to False,  T & (m | T) to T and t & (T | T) to t.
Our formula now becomes: 

F & ((((u & ((((z & ((False | (s | T))) & z) | T) | F)) | u) & (!((t & t) & F))))

4. Simplify (False | s | T) TO T, and t & t to t.
Our formula now becomes:

5. Further simplify z & T to z, (anything | T | F to T, t & F to F, and !F to T.
Our formula now becomes:

6. Further simplify z | T to T, (anything | T) to T.
Our formula now becomes:

F & ((((u & T) | u) & T))

7. Lastly, simplify u & T to u, and u | u to u.
Our formula now becomes:

2. (!F) simplifies to T, because it's the negation of false.
3. (T|(w&(w|(w|w))) |w) simplifies to T because ""w or w or w"" is just w, and ""w and w"" is just w, so it essentially becomes T or w which is just T.
4. (((w & T) |w)&(F|(T&((T|F)&F)))) simplifies to ((w & T) |w) since (T&(T|F)&F) simplifies to F which leads (F or F) to be false.
5. The simplification above essentially boils down to w since ""w and T"" or w is just w.

Its AND with F, (F & T), is equal to F. So, F&((!(T|(!T)))&T) is F.
We now simplify ((l|l)|(t&F)). Since anything AND'ed with F is F and anything OR'ed with itself is itself, this part becomes (l|F), which is just l.
We then simplify ((r&r)&(l&(f&F))) to ((r&r)&(l&F)). As l AND'ed with F is F, therefore ((r&r)&(l&(f&F))) is (r & F), which simplifies to F. Hence !(((r&r)&(((l|l)|(t&F))&(f&F)))&F) becomes !(F & F) which further simplifies to !F which is equal to T.
Therefore, T&((F&((!(T|(!T)))&T))&(!((!(((r&r)&(((l|l)|(t&F))&(f&F)))&F))|T)) simplifies to T.
Now, simplifying b|(T&((F&((!(T|(!T)))&T))&(!((!(((r&r)&(((l|l)|(t&F))&(f&F)))&F))|T))), we get b|T which is always T. Therefore, b|(b|(T&((F&((!(T|(!T)))&T))&(!((!(((r&r)&(((l|l)|(t&F))&(f&F)))&F))|T)))) simplifies to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value AND False (x&F) results in False. Any value AND True (x&T) will be the value x itself. Any value OR False (x|F) will be the value x itself. Any value OR True (x|T) will be True. Let's use these premises to simplify the formula:

((g&((F|(a&F))&T))&T)&((((m|(((((m&m)|m)&T)&((((m&T)|((m&m)|(m&T)))|F)&m))&(m|m)))&F)&F)|T)

The inner portion (a&F) evaluates to false because A AND False is always false. (F|(a&F)) simplifies to F, because False OR False is always false.

(g&F)&T simplifies to (g&F) because the T doesn't have an effect. (g&F) simplifies to F.

So the left portion of the original expression simplifies to F.

2. Now for the right portion:

((((m|(((((m&m)|m)&T)&((((m&T)|((m&m)|(m&T)))|F)&m))&(m|m)))&F)&F)|T)

Again, F&T simplifies to F and m|F simplifies to m. Also, m&m simplifies to m because m AND m is always m. That means, (((m&m)|m)&T) simplifies to (m|m) which is m. The inside part simplifies to m. That means ((((m&T)|((m&m)|(m&T)))|F)&m simplifies to (m|F)&m which simplifies to m&m which simplifies to m.

So, the whole right expression ((((m|(((((m&m)|m)&T)&((((m&T)|((m&m)|(m&T)))|F)&m))&(m|m)))&F)&F)|T) simplifies to F.

        ((e&((e&e)&T))|F)|T)&F) = F
        ((m&((((u&u)|(F&T))&(!T))&F))&T) = F

2. Any value or operation ored (|) with True (T) gives True (T):
       (((e&((e&e)&T))|F)|T) = T
       ((m|T) = T

3. Multiple identical values anded (&) together does not change the result:
       e&e = e
       u&u = u

4. Any value anded (&) with True (T) gives the value itself:
      (e&e)&T = e&T = e
      i&!(....)&T = i&!(...)

5. Logical not (!) in front of False (F) or True (T) gives True and False, respectively:
      !T = F
      !F = T

6. Any value anded with itself gives the value itself:
      e&e = e
      u&u = u

7. Any value ored (|) with False (F) provides the value itself:
       (u&u)|F = u|F = u  

8. Not False is True and not True is False:
       !T = F
       !F = T

9. After applying the above steps, we have an expression full of ""F"", ""T"", ""&"" and ""|"", where we know:

4. (F&F) = F as False AND anything is always False.

4. Now, (i&T)&((!F)|T) is equivalent to (i&T)&T, which is equvalent to i&T, as the AND operation with True does not change the original value.

5. Then next goes t|i&T|T|T = T, because if one of the values of a logical OR operation is True, then the result is always True regardless of the values of the other inputs.

6. Now, ((F|T)&T)&T, is equivalent to T&T&T = T, as the logical OR operation between any pair will return True and a logical AND operation with True will return True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider the following basic rules of Boolean algebra:

- A & F = F for any A, because 'and' needs both sides to be True. If one side is False, the whole statement is False.
- A | F = A for any A, because 'or' needs at least one side to be True. So if one side is False, the whole statement is the value of the other side.
- !F = T and !T = F, because not switches from True to False and vice versa.
- F & T = F and T | F = T.

Now, use these rules to simplify your formula step by step.

((F&((F&(p&F))&T))&(T|(F|(((n|F)|((((n|(((F&T)|F)|(!(F|T))))|(n|(F|F)))&(b|T))&(!F)))&F))).

The innermost expressions are (p&F), (F&T), (F|F), and (F|T). Simplify them:

- p&F = F
- F&T = F
- F|F = F
- F|T = T

So the formula now becomes:

((F&((F&F)&T))&(T|(F|(((n|F)|((((n|(F|F)|(!T)))|(n|F))&(b|T))&T))&F))).

Continue simplifying:

- F&F = F
- F|F = F
- (n|F) = n
- (n|F) = n
- (b|T) = T

So the formula now becomes:

((F&F)&T)&(T|(F|((n|(((n|F)|(!T))|n))&T)&F)).

Again simplify:

- F&F = F
- (n|F) = n

So the formula now becomes:

(F&T)&(T|(F|((n|((n|(!T))|n))&T)&F)).

Simplify again:

- F&T = F
- (n|n) = n

So the formula now becomes:

F&(T|(F|((n|(!T))&T)&F)).

Finally, this simplifies to:

- F&X = F for any X,

(((((c&(T&(!((f|(!(w|(F|T))))&F))))&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&(!(!(!(((z|F)&T)&F)))))))|F))|(!F))

We would start by simplifying `(!(w|(F|T)))` to `!w` because `F|T` is True and something OR True is always True.

Then, simplify `((f|!w)&F)` to `F` because something AND False is always False.

Next, simplify `T&!(F)` to `T` because NOT False is True.

Then eliminate &T and |F throughout as c & True becomes c and c | False also becomes c.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The formula contains T|T more than once. Since this expression represents the OR operation of True with True, it will always yield True. Thus, we can simplify T|T to T.

2. The formula also contains F&F, which is the logical AND of False with False. It will always be False. Hence, F&F simplifies to F.

3. Your formula also includes T&T, but the AND operation on True and True always yields True so simplify T&T to T. 

4. Inside the negation operation, we have F|!F which essentially means False OR Not False i.e., False OR True. As per OR operation if any one of the inputs is True, the output will be True. So F|!F is equivalent to T.

5. We notice that e is AND with T (e&T). Since anything AND with True is the original value itself, we can simplify this to e.

6. There's also an OR operation on a value with False (e|F). Since anything OR with False is the original value itself, this also simplifies to e.

7. We have the AND operation on any value v with True (v&T). Anything AND with True equal the same value. Thus, v&T simplifies to v.

8.Furthermore, we find the AND operation of any value with False (v&F, c&F). Anything AND with False is always False. So, v&F and c&F can be Simplified to F.

9. Importance must be given to the distributive law, which states that A&(B|C) = (A&B)|(A&C) and vice versa. For instance, v&T&v becomes (v&v)&T, further simplifying to v&T.

10. Also, the laws of negation state that !(F|!F) = !T = F meaning that the negation of True is False.

Next, F or anything is either F or that thing. So, we can replace (F|(F|((T|F)&T))) with T (since T or F in conjunction with T will always be T), and replace (F|(T|((T|((o|(!F))|((q&q)|T)))&F))) with T (since T or anything is always T).

The not operator flips the value of its operand. So we can replace (!F) with T.

(((h&F)|(T|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))))|(h&(h|F)))|(!F).

Now, noting the expression (!(((F&T)&T)&T)). Anything ANDed with F would result in F, so we can simplify this to just F. (!F) then will yield True, so that part of the formula becomes True as well:

Then, the formula simplifies to:

(((h&F)|(T|True)))|(h&(h|F)))|True.

The OR operation against True always results in True. Hence, |T or |True operation is redundant and can be reduced. So, the formula now is:

(h&F)|(h&(h|F))|True.

Since anything ANDed by False becomes False, (h&F) simplifies to F.
So,

F|(h&(h|F))|True.

AND operation is always dominated by False. Hence, (h|F) simplifies to True because something ORed with False is just itself. So:

F|(h&True)|True.

But since anything ANDed with True remains the same, so h&True just becomes h. Therefore,

F|h|True.

This simplifies to True, because anything ORed with True is always True. Hence, the final simplified formula is:

2. F | F equals to F, and T | T equals to T, because the same value's 'or' is itself.
3. T & T equals to T, because the same value's 'and' is itself.
4. F | statement or statement | F is equal to statement, because 'or' with F doesn't change the statement.
5. T & statement or statement & T is equal to statement, because 'and' with T doesn't change the statement.

3. Inside the second outer brackets ((d|(j|(T&(!F))))&T):

    Simplify T&(!F) to T&T, which then simplifies to T. So, this becomes (d|(j|T))&T, which simplifies to T.

(j|(!((p|F)&(F))))&(T&((s|T))).

2. For any variable X, X&X is always equal to X and X|X is also always equal to X. Therefore, (s&s) is equal to s. So the statement becomes:

3. Moreover, we know that 'F' always makes 'and' expressions false. Therefore, a p&F term is automatically equal to 'F' and can be disregarded. Therefore, the statement simplifies to: 
(j|(!F))&(T&s).

4. The negation of 'F', !F, is 'T'. Therefore, j|(!F) simplifies to j|T. As mentioned earlier, anything 'or' T is always 'T', so the statement simplifies to:

Step 2:
Since we have T|T this will resolve to T due to property (viii), and because of the double negative operation, you just get T again.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's look at some immediate simplifications dictated by the logical properties (I'll explain while simplifying):

The expression `n | F` is always equal to `n`. This is because the 'or' operator will produce True whenever at least one of the operands is True. If `n` is True, the whole expression is True, regardless of the second operand (F, which is always False). If `n` is False, the whole expression is False because both operands are False. So, we can simplify `n | F` to `n`.

`o & o` is equivalent to `o` because `o` and `o` will either be both True or both False. Then, `o & T` is equivalent to `o`, as `o` and `T` would logically be `o`.

Any expression `x & F` is always False, regardless of the value of `x`. So `o & F` is equivalent to `F`.

Also, `F | F` is always False. And `F & T` is always False, because `F & anything` is False. And `anything | F` is always equivalent to `anything`

The not operator `!`, when applied to False, produces True (`!F` is `T`). And `F | T` is always True, so `!F | F` is `T | T`, which is `T`.

Finally, any expression `e & T` is always equivalent to `e`, because `e & T == e` for any `e`.

Using these simplifications, your logic formula becomes:

`((n & n) & (h | (T | T)))`.

This simplifies further to:

`n & (h | T)`.

And since `anything | T` is always True, final simplification gives us simply:

`n & T`.

According to our rules, This is equivalent to `n`. So the result is `n`.",n,n

(T|(T|T)) = T, because true or true is true
(x&T) = x, because anything and true is the original value
(F&T) = F, because false and true is false

The equation then becomes:
(T&(((a|F)|((a&T)&(f|(!(((v|(v|((v&v)|F))&x)&T))))))&F))

On the next step we can simplify (a|F), ((v&v)|F), (v|(v|((v&v)|F))), ((v|(v|((v&v)|F)))&x), and the overall equation due to final &F.
(a|F) = a, because anything or false is the original value
((v&v)|F) = v, because anything or false is the original value
(v|(v|v)) = v, v or v is just v

- (v&T) is equivalent to AND(v, T), it can only be True if both variables are True. Thus it cannot affect the outcome of (T | (! (v&T))) as 'or' operation with True is always True.
- (!T) simplifies to F, because it's negating True.
- (h | (F|T)) simplifies to (h | T) which is always T because 'or' operation with True is always True.
- (F|T) simplifies to T.

- (((b|((u|T))|F))) simplifies to (b|T) and hence it simplifies to T.

Starting the simplification:

The expression (((((f|f)&T)|F)&T)&f) simplifies to f since (f|f) is f, and any expression AND TRUE (&T) doesn't change the expression, and any expression OR FALSE (|F) also doesn't change the expression.

The expression (((T|T)|F)&(T|(T&T)))&T simplifies to T since T OR anything (T|anything) is always T, so the whole expression simplifies to T.

(((T|T)|F)&(T|(T&T)))&T simplifies to T

The NOT operator (!) inverts the truth value of its operand, so !T is F and !(p|T) is !T, which is F.

The expression (!((p|((((T|T)|F)&(T|(T&T)))&T))&T is (!F)&T, simplifies to T.

The expression (((f& T)|(!F))&(F|(T|T))) is (f&T)&T, simplifies to f (because T AND anything yields the thing itself and T OR anything yields T).

Therefore, (F|F)&(F&T) simplifies to F & F, which is F.
So, (T|(F|(T|(T|(F))))) simplifies to T (because T OR anything is always T).

1) False AND anything = False (F & x = F)
2) True OR anything = True (T | x = T)
3) Negation of True is False and vice versa (!T = F and !F = T)
4) Anything OR itself is itself (x | x = x)

Given this, let's start evaluating:

I. (F | ((!(T | (T & (F & (T | ! (F | T)))))) & F ) & (T & ((!( ((F & T) | T) | F) | T) ) | T ) ))

Looking at the subexpression: (F | T) = T. Subbing this into the outer expressions simplifies it to:

II. (F | ((!(T | (T & (F & T)))) & F ) & (T & (!( T | T | F | T | T) ) | T ) )

Solving (T | T | F | T | T), this equals True (T). So, negating T gives us False (F):

III. (F | ( ( !(T | (T & F ) ) ) & F ) & (T & F | T) )

Where, (T & F) equals False (F)

IV. (F | ( ( !(T | F) ) & F ) & (T & F | T) )

Now, (T | F) equals True (T), also (T & F) equals False (F)

V. (F | ( !T & F ) & F )

Negating T gives us False (F), so we simplify to:

This results in False (F).

Let's also simplify the second part of the formula:

(((w|w)&T)|T)

VII. (w & T) | T

Now, plug in the parts I and II into the original expression we have:

(F & ((w & T) | T) )

Evaluating the expression (w & T) gives either True (T) or False (F) depends on w. If w is True (T), then w & T = T. Otherwise, if w is False (F), then w & T = F. By plugging these into the formula we get:

When w = T:
(F & (T | T)) = F & T = F

(F & (F | T)) = F & T = F

3. T&F is F, F|F is F. So, F|(!(T&(((t&t)|F)|T))) is F|!T, which is T.
4. Also, T&i will be i, because any True value Bounded with AND( & ) operator will return same variable.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should know that any logical statement OR-ed with True (T) always results in True, any logical statement AND-ed with True always results in the logical statement itself, any logical statement OR-ed with False results in the logical statement itself, and any logical statement AND-ed with False always results in False.

Next, we will simplify from the inner statements to the outermost statement.

The inner statement: 

1. F & F results in F.
2. !T results in F since T is true and 'not True' is False.
3. T & F results in F.
4. Any statement & F will always result in F. So (((!T)&((!(F&(F&F)))|(!(e&(o&F)))))&(F&((!T)|F))) simplifies to F.
5. s | s will always result in s as 's or s' is always s.
6. Any statement or True will always result in True. So (((s|s)|F)|T) simplifies to T regardless of the value of s.
   
Finally, the outermost statement:

1. F & T simplifies to F.
2. (T & T)|F simplifies to T since any statement OR-ed with True is always True.
3. Combining both, T|F simplifies to T as any statement OR-ed with True is always True.

So the overall simplification of the formula is:

(((((s|s)|((!(T&((!T)&((!(F&(F&F)))|(!(e&(o&F)))))))&(F&((!T)|F))))|T)&((T&T)|F))|(F&T))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we simplify obvious values like T|F and T|T or F|F and F&T which are always true or false respectively. 
    So, (!(h|T))&(T&((!((T&F)&((T|((!(!(T&(F|F))))|F))|(T&(((!(T&(T|F)))|T)&T)))))|(!(h&F)))) becomes
   !(h|T)&(T&((!((F)&((T|((!(!F))|F))|(T&((!(F)|T)&T)))))|(!h))).

2. Any variable or statement OR True (A|T) is always true (T), and any variable or statement AND False (A&F) is always False (F). 
   Also, double negation, i.e., NOT NOT ( !! ) is equal to no negation.
   So, 
   !(h|T)&(T&((!((F)&((T|((!F)|F))|(T&((F|T)&T)))))|(!h)))  becomes
    F&(T&((!(F&T))|(!h)))  which is
    F&(T&((T)|(!h))) since F&T is always False (F) and !F is T. 

3. Further simplifying gives 
   F&T = F and T or F = F. 
   Hence, overall expression becomes

2. Now, we know T&Anything = Anything, so this simplifies further to ((!(e|F))&T).

3. Then we know Anything|F = Anything, thus it simplifies to ((!e)&T).

Also, remember:
1. any_value|T and T|any_value simplify to T (True), as one operand is True.
2. any_value|F and F|any_value simply simplify to any_value as one operand is False.
3. !T simplifies to F (False), while !F simplifies to T (True).

((m|T)&((F&(d|T))|(T&((F|((F&(F&F))|F))&((u&(T&((((T&T)&F)&(T&((x|T)|(F|F))))|(!T))))&F))))).

This converts the expression to:

((m|T)&((F&(d|T))|(T&((F|(F|F))&((u&(T&(F&(T|F))))|F))&F))).

Now, simplify T&F, T&any_value, F&any_value, any_value|F

This gives:

Simplify any_value|T

So the expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify ((!F)|F) as T (since not F and F will always cover all possibilities). Also T&F or T|T as F or T which is always T. Moreover, v&T is just v if v is True and F if v is False. With these considerations, we simplify the larger formula:

((F|(l|((((F&(!T)))|(T&((v|T))|T)))|T)&(b&(T&((F&F)&T))))

Simplify F&(!T) - (since !T is always False, and F&False is always False):

((F|(l|((((F&F)))|(T&((v|T))|T)))|T)&(b&(T&((F&F)&T))))

Simplifying inside brackets first ((T&((v|T))|T)) is T (since T&v is either T or F, and  |T will always be T), and F&F as F:

Next, x|T=T and F&T=F:

((F|(l|T)|T)&(b&(T&F)))

((!(f|(T&((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&(F))))|((T&(y|(T|((F)&F))))|F))))))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T)).

Step 2: F and anything (towards the right end of the expression) equals F. Additionally, 'F' OR 'F' equals 'F':

((!(f|(T&((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&F)))|((T&(y|(T|F)))|F))))))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T)).

Step 3: T OR T is T and T OR F is again T and (b OR b) AND b is b:

((!(f|(T&((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&F)))|((T&(y&T))|F))))))|(T|T)).

Step 4: Replace T & T with T and using the fact that T OR any value equals to T:

((!(f|(T&((T&(x&(m&F)))|((T&y)|F))))|T).

Step 5: T OR F is T:

((!(f|(T&((T&(x&(m&F)))|T)))|T).

Step 6: F & anything equals to F and T & anything equals to that thing:

3. Simplify by applying that AND-ing a value with T, returns the original value, and AND-ing a value with F, returns F. Also, NOR-ing (NOT OR) a value with itself is equivalent to apply NOT operation to the value. Taking these into account, the formula becomes ((!(T))&T)&(!(w&h&F&j&T&T&T&T)&F).
4. Applying NOT T operation, which turns into F, simplifies the received formula into (F&T)&(!F&F) since any value NOTed results into the flip of that value.

- Since 'h|h' is just 'h' and 'h&T' is 'h' (as 'T' would not change the value of 'h'), these parts can simplified to 'h'.
- '(g|T)' is 'T' (since anything 'or' 'T' is 'T') and also '(T|F)' is obviously 'T'. So, '(g|T)|(T|F)' simplifies to 'T'.
- Similarly, '(!F)' is 'T', so 'T & T' is 'T'. Therefore, we can simplify 'F|(((g|T)|(T|F))&(!F))' to 'T'.
- So, the complex inner part 'h&((h|(h&T))&(F|(((g|T)|(T|F))&(!F))))' can be simplified as 'h'.

2. Now look at the expression (a&T)&T. Since T is True, a&T is simply a. Therefore, ((a&T)&T)&((a&a)&T) simplifies to a&a which is simply a, since anything AND with itself is again just itself. 

3. Therefore, (((a&T)&T)&((a&a)&T))&(a&a) simplifies to a&a which is a.

4. Now, notice that anything OR True is True. Hence the expression inside all the parentheses: a|T simplifies to T. So the part F|((F&(w&F))&((a|T))) simplifies to F|T which is T. 

5. Here, anything AND True is just the original thing. So, s&((F|((F&(w&F))&((a|T)))) simplifies to s&T which is s. 

6. Notice that anything OR False is that thing itself. So, s&((F|((F&(w&F))&((a|T))))|F simplifies to s|F which is s. 

7. (T|(!T)) is a well known contradiction and it is always True. Thus s&((s&((F|((F&(w&F))&((a|T)))))|(T|(!T)))) is s&T which simplifies to s.

8. After step 1, the expression !(T&(F&T)) becomes !(T&F) which simplifies to !F, and the negation of False is surely True.

Second, any operation K&F or F&K equals to the False regardless of the value K. And any operation K&T or T&K equals to K.

Third, note that s&s equals to s and g&g equals to g.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First notice that !F is equal to T (as negating false becomes true), and that F&ANYTHING and ANYTHING&F is always equal to F (because false and anything is always false). Similarly, T|ANYTHING and ANYTHING|T is always equal to T (because true or anything is always true).

So by applying these rules the formula simplifies to:

(T&((T&(F|(T|(T&((!(F&k))&T))))|F)).

Then consider that F|(T&(T&(!F&k))) is equal to T (since false or anything is the same as the value of the other condition and that negation of false and k is always true (as we already negated the false part), so it's just T).

This further simplifies the formula to:

T&(T&T).

In a similar way, T&T is equal to T (since true and true results in true).

Therefore the original formula simplifies to T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Since symbol & denotes logical AND operator, so when T & F, the result is always False. The same goes when F & anything, the result is always False. 

2. The symbol | denotes logical OR operator, so when F OR anything, the result is equivalent to that value. And when T OR anything, the result is always True.

3. The symbol ! denotes logical NOT operator. So, !T will result in F and !F will result in T.

Using these rules in the given expression - 

((((T&(F&((!(!(F&(F|T))))&(!(!(s|(((F|T)|(F|F))|(T&T))))))))&F)|T)|((!(F|((t&t)&F)))|F))

Let's simplify the formula step by step: 

First start with simplifying (F|F), (F&T) and (F|T)

!(((F|T)|(F|F))|(T&T)) --> !(T | F | T) --> !T -- > F

Now the formula looks like as follows: 

(((!(!F))&(!(!s|F)))&F)|T -- formula simplification on either side of F --> always equals F.

Then (((!F) & (!(!s | F))) & F) equals F. 

Finally, Complete formula looks as 

F|T|((!(F|F))|F) --> T | ((!T)| F) --> T | (F | F) --> T | F --> T

Hence, the simplified form of '((((T&(F&((!(!(F&(F|T))))&(!(!(s|(((F|T)|(F|F))|(T&T))))))))&F)|T)|((!(F|((t&t)&F)))|F))' is 'T'.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any variable or statement 'OR' False (|F) will be the variable or the statement itself. So, we can simplify (s|F) to s, (l|F) to l, and ((j|j)|F) to (j|j).

2. Any variable or statement 'AND' True (&T) will be the variable itself. So, we can simplify (((z&(z&z))&T)|T) to ((z&(z&z))|T), and (j&((j|j)|F)) to (j&(j|j)).

3. If we take 'AND' (&) with False, the result will always be False regardless of the other variable. Thus, ((z&(z&z))&F), ((l|F)|T)&F), (((F|(((l|F)|T)&F))&(((z&(z&z))&T)|T))&F) all simplify to F. 

4. Not False i.e., !F is true (T), and not T is F. So, 
    - So !T  simplifies to F.
    - !(((F|(((l|F)|T)&F))&(((z&(z&z))&T)|T))&F) simplifies to T.

5. Any variable or statement 'OR' True (|T) will always give True. So, we can simplify (j|T) and ((p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T) to T.

Finally, substituting the simplified parts to the original formula:

((s|F)|((F|(!(T|(!(((F|(((l|F)|T)&F))&(((z&(z&z))&T)|T)) & F))))) & ((p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T))))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the inner expression `(!(!F))` which results in `F`.

Next, we simplify `(!(T|F))` or `!(True|False)`, which results in `F`.

Replace `F&T` results in `F`.

Replace `T&F` results in `F`.

Therefore, `F&F` amounts to `F`.

We now insert this back into the original expression making it `(!(!((v|F))))`.

The double negatives cancel, making it `(v|F)`.

The value of `(T|F)` is `T`.

Therefore, the original expression simplifies down to `(x&v)&(T&T)&T`.

Simplify further, `(x&v)&T` or `(x and v) and True`. In logic operations 'and True' does not influence the result so, 

The original logic formula simplifies to `x & v`.",x & v,F

3. !(F | F) simplifies to True (T) since it's not False (F).
4. q | T simplifies to T for any value of q.
5. F | l simplifies to l for any value of l.

With this in mind, let's simplify the given expression:

(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)).

First, we simplify the inner expressions where possible as per rules 1-5:

((w|(w|((w|(F))|(w&((!(T))|(T&(T&(u&T))))))))&(T|F))|T)).

More simplifications using rules 1 and 4:

((w|(w|(w|(w&((F)|(T&(T&u))))))&(T))|T)).

Notice that w&F simplifies to F (Rule 2) and T&(T & u) simplifies to u (since T&T = T, and T&u = u):

((w|(w|(w|(F|u))))&T)|T)).

Then simplify using rule 1:

- (x&T) is always x, because we are logically AND-ing with True.
- (x|F) is always x, because we are logically OR-ing with False.

2. Also, from logic: A & False equals to False; A & A equals A; A | F equals A; A | A equals A; !

   False equals True; not A equals False if and only if A equals True.

   Applying the above logic rules we'll get:

3. F|T is True because True or anything is True.
4. (!((F&F)&(F|T)))&F is False. Explanation: innermost expression (F|T) is True, (F&F) is False, then we have !(False&True) which simplifies to !False i.e., True and then we have True&F which is False.
