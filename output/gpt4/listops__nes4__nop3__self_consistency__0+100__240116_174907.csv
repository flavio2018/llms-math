MAX 1 5 6 => maximum is 6.
MAX 9 4 1 => maximum is 9.
MAX 1 4 2 => maximum is 4.
MAX 2 2 8 => maximum is 8.

Now substitute these values to the original expression:

SM 6 9 3 => (6+9+3) mod 10 = 8.

[MAX 8 [MAX 3 8 4] [MAX 9 5 0]] becomes [MAX 8 8 9], which simplifies to 9.

Now, the entire second part of the expression [SM [SM 2 [SM 1 7 8] [SM 1 6 4]] [MAX 8 [MAX 3 8 4] [MAX 9 5 0]] 0] simplifies to [SM 9 9 0] = 8.

[SM 8 0 3] = 1.

[SM [MAX 9 4 0] [SM 0 4 2] 7] becomes [SM 9 6 7], which simplifies to 2 (mod 10 operation).

Now we substitute these values back into the expression:

   And [SM 3 7 0] = 0 (mod 10) = 0, [SM 0 5 5] = 0 (mod 10) = 0
2. MAX operator gives maximum value from the inputs, [MAX 7 8 2] = 8, [MAX 7 7 8] = 8
   [MAX 7 0 1] = 7, [MAX 2 9 7] = 9, [MAX 9 0 0] = 9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's calculate some simple operations from the inside which are:

[MIN 0 9 9] = 0

[MAX 4 1 8] = 8

[MIN 0 6 6] = 0

[MIN 2 1 2] = 1

[MAX 6 7 0] = 7

[SM 8 8 2] = 8, because (8 + 8 + 2) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

[MIN 9 2 6] = 2

[SM 2 4 6] = 2, because (2 + 4 + 6) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2

Now, put these results into the original expression, we get:

[MIN [MIN [MAX 0 8 8] 7 7] 2 [MAX [MAX 1 7 8] [MIN 2 8 2] 2]]

Now calculate again:

[MAX 0 8 8] = 8

[MIN 8 7 7] = 7

[MAX 1 7 8] = 8

[MIN 2 8 2] = 2

So the expression reduces further to:

[MIN 7 2 [MAX 8 2 2]]

After these operations, now perform:

[MAX 8 2 2] = 8

So, the final reduced expression is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting from the innermost brackets:

- The MAX of 9, 4, and 5 is 9.
- The MIN of 8, 6, and 6 is 6.
- So, MAX [MAX 9 4 5] [MIN 8 6 6] 8 becomes MAX 9 6 8, which is 9.

- The MAX of 1, 9, and 6 is 9.
- The MAX of 6, 7 and 1 is 7.
- So, SM 4 [MAX 1 9 6] [MAX 6 7 1] becomes SM 4 9 7, which is 20. But since SM is a sum modulo 10 operation, the result is 0.

So, SM [MAX [MAX 9 4 5] [MIN 8 6 6] 8] 7 [SM 4 [MAX 1 9 6] [MAX 6 7 1]] becomes 
SM 9 7 0, which is 16 modulo 10 = 6.

Next:

- The SM of 4, 1, and 7 is 12 modulo 10 = 2.
- The MIN of 6, 5, and 2 is 2.
- So, MIN [SM 4 1 7] [MIN 6 5 2] 1 becomes MIN 2 2 1, which is 1.

- The SM of 0, 5, and 5 is 10 modulo 10 = 0.
- The MIN of 1, 7 and 8 is 1.
- So, SM 2 [SM 0 5 5] [MIN 1 7 8] becomes SM 2 0 1, which is 3.

So, SM [MIN [SM 4 1 7] [MIN 6 5 2] 1] [SM 2 [SM 0 5 5] [MIN 1 7 8]] 8 becomes SM 1 3 8, which is 12 modulo 10 = 2.

- [MIN 3 [MAX 2 7 8] [MIN 3 1 9]] = 3

- [MAX 5 1 2] = 5
- [SM 3 1 8] = 2

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to determine the values for all MAX and MIN operators.

Looking at the first set: [MAX 5 [MAX 7 1 2] [MAX 8 6 0]], we find the maximum in each set:

MAX 5 7 = 7
MAX 8 6 0 = 8

Then we find the max between 5, 7 and 8, which is 8.

So, the first set evaluates to 8.

Looking at the second set: [MAX 2 [MAX 3 5 1] [MAX 7 9 5]], we do the same:

MAX 3 5 1 = 5
MAX 7 9 5 = 9

Then we find the max between 2, 5 and 9, which is 9.

So, the second set evaluates to 9.

For the third set: [MAX [MAX 6 3 2] 4 [MIN 2 8 5]], we find:

MAX 6 3 2 = 6
MIN 2 8 5 = 2

Then we find the max between 6, 4 and 2, which is 6.

So, the third set evaluates to 6.

For the fourth set: [MAX [MIN 4 6 5] [MIN 1 4 3] 7], we find:

MIN 4 6 5 = 4
MIN 1 4 3 = 1

Then we find the max between 4, 1 and 7, which is 7.

So, the fourth set evaluates to 7.

Now we find the MIN between 8, 9, and 1. The smallest number is 1.

So the expression becomes [SM 0 1 [MAX 6 7 0]].

Now we find the max between 6, 7 and 0, which is 7.

The expression simplifies to [SM 0 1 7].

The SM operator means we sum the numbers and take the modulo 10, i.e. the remainder when the sum is divided by 10.

0 + 1 + 7 = 8

So, the expression simplifies to 8. Therefore, the final answer is 8.",8,8

[MAX [SM 2 3 6] [MAX [MAX 7 1 7] [MIN 5 5 8] 3] 6] = [MAX 11 [MAX 7 5 3] 6]

Solving the next round of brackets:
[SM 2 3 6] = 1 (because 2+3+6=11, and 11 mod 10 = 1)
[MAX 7 1 7] = 7
[MIN 5 5 8] = 5

[MAX 1 [MAX 7 5 3] 6]= [MAX 1 7 6]

Solving that gives:

[MAX 2 6 1] = 6
[MIN 8 6 7] = 6
[SM 8 3 6] = 7 (because 8+3+6=17 and 17 mod 10 = 7)

[MIN [MIN 2 5 5] [MAX 4 5 9] 7] becomes [MIN 2 9 7] since the minimum of three numbers is the smallest one and maximum of three numbers is the biggest one. 

[SM [MIN 2 1 5] 9 [SM 0 6 4]] becomes [SM 1 9 10] because the sum modulo 10 of 0,6,4 is 10.

- Let's now resolve SM 6 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 ⇒ SM 6 9 = 5 (we use modulo 10)
- The expression is now [SM 5 [SM 7 1 9]] [SM 7 0 [MIN 4 [SM 7 5 2] 7]] 1

- [MAX 7 5 2] gives the maximum of the values 7, 5, and 2, which is 7.

[SM 0 [SM [MIN 1 6 7] 0 [SM 4 1 [SM 5 0 3]]] [MAX [SM 9 4 2] [MAX 5 [SM 2 1 7] 7] 0]].

The next MIN operation is [MIN 1 6 7] which gives us the minimum of 1, 6, and 7 which is 1.

The sum and max operations next are as follows: 

- [SM 4 1 [SM 5 0 3]] becomes [SM 4 1 8] (because the sum of 5, 0, and 3 is 8 modulo 10), then becomes 3 (since the sum of 4, 1, and 8 is 13, and modulo 10, it becomes 3).
- [SM 9 4 2] becomes 5 (since the sum of 9, 4, and 2 is 15, and modulo 10, it becomes 5).
- [SM 2 1 7] becomes 0 (since the sum of 2, 1, and 7 is 10, and modulo 10, it becomes 0).

The last MAX operation, [MAX 5 0 7], will result in 7, which is the maximum value.

So, our expression now is:

After substituting those results, you have:

In the second max operator we see MIN [SM 3 5 7]. The sum of 3, 5 and 7 is 15 and its modulo 10 results in 5 and the minimum of 5, 0 and the maximum of 3, 2 and 0 is [MIN 5 0 3] which turns out to be 0.

We have more Min commands to perform:

MIN 4 1 1 = 1.

Updating the equation again:

[MAX 3 5 1] = Maximum of 3, 5, 1 is 5.
[SM 7 1 6] = 7 + 1 + 6 = 14 modulo 10 = 4 and

Now for the cases with two numbers
[MAX 8 8] = max(8, 8) = 8,
[MIN 7 4 8] = min(7, 4, 8) = 4,

[MAX [MIN 5 4 4] 7 [MAX 6 6 6]] => [MAX 4 7 6] = 7 

So the initial expression gets simplified to:

[MIN [SM 9 0 0] [MAX 7 1 7] 6] 

Next, we simplify further:

[SM 9 0 0] => (9 + 0 + 0) mod 10 = 9 

[MAX 7 1 7] => 7

So, the expression simplifies to:

[MIN 9 7 6] 

After evaluating, we get the final answer:

MIN 9 7 6 => 6.",6,6
99,listops,self_consistency,[MAX 9 [MIN [SM [SM 1 7 1] 9 [MIN 3 3 3]] 6 [SM [MIN 2 0 6] [MIN 0 9 9] 1]] [MAX [SM [MAX 1 0 7] [MAX 5 5 9] 3] 5 [MAX [SM 7 8 3] 8 [SM 0 9 2]]]],"Q: MIN, MAX and SM are operators on lists of single-digit integers which have the semantics of minimum, maximum and sum modulo 10, respectively. Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[MAX 9 [MIN [SM [SM 1 7 1] 9 [MIN 3 3 3]] 6 [SM [MIN 2 0 6] [MIN 0 9 9] 1]] [MAX [SM [MAX 1 0 7] [MAX 5 5 9] 3] 5 [MAX [SM 7 8 3] 8 [SM 0 9 2]]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's solve all the innermost brackets which are:

[SM 1 7 1], [MIN 2 0 6], [MIN 0 9 9], [MAX 1 0 7], [MAX 5 5 9], [SM 7 8 3], [SM 0 9 2], and [MIN 3 3 3].

Starting with the first [SM 1 7 1], we find their sum and then take the modulo 10 which will be: (1+7+1) mod 10 = 9

Next one is[MIN 2 0 6], it gives us minimum common digit which is '0'

After that [MIN 0 9 9], minimum digit is '0'

The next one [MAX 1 0 7] means maximum digit which is '7'

Moving on to the next one [MAX 5 5 9], which results is '9'

Next in the order, [SM 7 8 3], we sum the digits and find the modulus which will be: (7+8+3) mod 10 = 8

The next one is, [SM 0 9 2]. So, (0+9+2) mod 10 = 1

Finally, [MIN 3 3 3] gives us minimum among the digits which is '3'

Now that we've simplified the inside brackets, let's substitute these values back in to continue simplifying. The equation now is:

[MAX 9 [MIN 9 9 6 [SM 0 0 1]] [MAX [SM 7 9 3] 5 [MAX 8 8 1]]]

Further solving, [SM 0 0 1], [SM 7 9 3], we get (0+0+1) mod 10 = 1 and (7+9+3) mod 10 = 9.

So, the equation now is:

[MAX 9 [MIN 9 9 6 1] [MAX 9 5 8]]

Further simplifying it results in:

[MAX 9 1 9]

Finally the maximum single digit integer among [9 1 9] is '9'. So, the final answer is 9.",9,9
