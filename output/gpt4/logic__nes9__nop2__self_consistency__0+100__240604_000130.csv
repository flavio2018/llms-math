Then solve for (T|F). Since T stands for True and F stands for False, T|F will always be True.

Simplify ((g&(l|n|True))|F). It means g AND (l OR n OR True) OR False. This is equivalent to g or False. Because anything OR True, whether l or n is False, the whole segment will be True. 

The equation now will be: ((F|T)&(g|g|F)&F)).

Solve for (F|T). This will be equal to True since T|F will always be True. 

the equation becomes: (True&(g|F)&F)).
Solve for (g|F). This results in g since g|False is equivalent to g.

After that simplification we get:

((l & (l & ((w & T) | T) | F)) | ((l | (o & F)) & l))

- (w & T) is simply w, since anything AND True remains the same
- (o & F) is simply F, because anything AND False is always False

Our expression becomes:

- (w | T) = T  because anything OR True is always True
- (l | F) = l because anything OR False remains the same

Our expression turns into:

((l & (l & T) | F) | (l & l))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: First, we know that T & F is always False because 'and' operation requires both values to be True to result in True, otherwise it turns out False. Therefore, we can simplify the formula to False where T&F appears.

Step 2: Then we can simplify T&F to False, and F|(!T) simplifies to False as well since (!T) is False.

Step 3: After that, we know that anything 'and'ed with False is False, and anything 'or'ed with False is just the original value. So we can simplify the formula as shown below:

    (False&((((m|False)&T)&((((((p&T)|T)&(!False))|T)&False)&T))&False)).

    (False&((((m)&T)&((((((p&T)|T)&(True))|T)&False)&T))&False)).

2) ""A & A"" is always equal to A as well, because an and (&) operation between the same logical values always gives back the original value. So, ""(m & m) = m"".

3) ""A & T"" is always equal to A. Since m can be either True or False, the and (&) operation with True always gives back the original expression. Thus, “(m & T) = m”.

4) ""A & F"" is always equal to F, since the logical ""and"" operation requires both operands to be True to return True. If A = m is False, ""(m & F)"" equals False. If A = m is True, ""(m & F)"" still equals False because ""F"" is False. Hence, ""m & F = F"".

5) ""A | F"" is always equal to A. This leads back to the simplification in step 1 from ""m | F = m"".

After that, the expressions (T|F) can be simplified to T.
The logic expression would then be changed to: ((v&(T&T))&T).

The expressions (T & T) can be simplified to T.

3. ((!(F&F))|(v|(T&F)|T)) reduces to (!F|v|F|T), which further simplifies to T because logical OR with a True yields True.

- (T & T) simplifies to T because true AND-ed with true is true.
- (r | r) simplifies to r because anything OR-ed with itself is itself.
- (d | d) simplifies to d and (d & d) simplifies to d, likewise.

(x | (y & (r | T | T | d | T | T)) | T).

Next, we know that:
- r | T simplifies to T because anything OR-ed with True is True.
- d | T simplifies to T for the same reason.

The expression after second step of simplification is: 
(x | (y & T) | T).

Now, since anything AND-ed with True is itself, (y & T) simplifies to y. Hence, the expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the innermost brackets.

(1) (h|h) is equal to h, since any value or'd with itself remains the same.
(2) !F is equal to T, since the negation of False is True.
(3) (F|F) is equal to F, since False or False remains False.
(4) (!(!F)) is equal to F, since the double negation of a value is the same value.

Replacing the corresponding parts in the main expression with these simplified forms, we get:

((!((y&(l&(m&((h&F)|(T))))))|F))&(!(!((g&(g|F))&F))).

Now, let's continue with further simplifications.

(5) (h&F) is equal to F, since any value and'd with False results in False.
(6) ((F|T)) is equal to T, since False or True results in True.
(7) (g|F) is equal to g, since any value or'd with False remains the same.

Substituting these into the expression, we obtain:

((!((y&(l&(m&T))))|F))&(!(!((g&g)&F))).

Continuing with further simplifications,

(8) (l&(m&T)) or l&m, since any value and'd with True remains the same.
(9) ((g&g)&F) or (g&F), since any value and'd with itself remains the same.

So we finally have: 

((!((y&(l&m)))|F))&(!(!(g&F))).

Continuing with further simplifications,

(10) !((y&(l&m))) equals to ((!y)|(l&m)), according to De Morgan's Law.
(11) (!(!(g&F))) equals to (g&F) or g, because negating the negation of a value gives us the value itself.

Substituting these into the expression, we obtain:

(((!y)|(l&m))|F)&(g&F).

Final simplifications:

(12) ((!y)|(l&m)|F) equals to ((!y)|(l&m)) since or'ing anything with False doesn't change the original.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we handle the constant values, T and F. n & F is always False, because anything logical and False is False. So the formula becomes (((l|(!T))&T)&T)|T.

2. And again, (False|l) is equal to l, therefore ((n&(F|(!T)))) changes to l. So, the formula becomes ((t&(((l& T)&T)|T)))|(t&((t|(t|((t&(t&(!F)))|t)))|t))).

3. Also, (!F) is True, because F is False and the negation of False is True. So, the formula becomes ((t&(l&T))|T)|(t&(t|t)). That simplifies to (t&T|T)|(t&t).

4. Next, l & T is simply l, because anything logical and True is itself. So the formula simplifies to (t&l|T)|(t&t).

5. Similarly, t & T is simply t. Therefore, the formula simplifies to (t | T) | t.

6. t|T or T or t is always True, indifferent to the values of t and l. If any of them are True then the entire expression is True. If both are False, then also the expression with || T remains True, because anything logical or True is True.

1. In logical operations, any variable OR'd with itself simply gives the value of that variable. So, (i | i) will simply equal i.
2. (T | T) on the other hand will equal T because T OR'd with anything is always T.
3. (T | F) is T because T OR'd with anything is T. Yet (d & T) is d because anything AND'd with T just gives the variable itself.

5. (!F) is T because the negation of a F value is T.
6. (T & T) is T because T AND'd with anything is itself.

8. Therefore, ((T|T)|(((d&(T|F))&F)|((((!F)|(T&T))|T)&T))) becomes T.
9. Similarly, F OR anything is just the variable/condition itself. So, F OR T results in T.

With these simplifications, the operation becomes:

(i & T) & T & T which is equivalent to i & T & T & T.

In this case, a variable AND'd with T is itself. Hence, the fully simplified form is: i.

So, the (!((T|(F|T))|(!(((!T)&F)&(!(((T&F)|(F|F))|(T|F)))))) simplifies to True.

- ""T|T"" simplifies to ""T"" (Anything OR with True is True).
- ""F|F"" simplifies to ""F"" (Anything OR with False remains the same).
- ""!((h|(F|(F&T)))|T))"" simplifies to ""F"" (Anything OR with True is True, and Not True is False).
- ""T&(!(T|(!T)))"" simplifies to ""F"" (T OR Not T is always True, and True AND Not True is always False. So, and anything AND with False is False ).
- ""F&T"" simplifies to ""F"" (Anything AND with False is False).

Substitute the simplifications in original formula, we got:

((q|q)&(T&F&F)).

Then simplifying ""q|q"" results in ""q"" and ""(T&F&F)"" results in ""F"".

By substituting it in the formula, we got:

q & F.

Finally, simplifying ""q & F"" results in ""F"", which is the solution.

* T|F, F|T again simplify to T for the same reason.
  
* T&F simplifies to F because an AND operation with 'False' (F) gives 'False' (F) regardless of the other value.

As such, the formula simplifies to '((T)|( !((T)|(((T)&F)|(T|(T|T)&(k|T))))&(a&!T) )'.
  
Substituting T&F = F back into the formula, we get:

'(T)|( !(T|((F)|(T|(T&k)))&(!T&a))'.
  
Looking at the middle section of the formula F|T is equivalent to T, resulting in:

Substituting T|T = T, we get:
  
'(T)|!(T&(!T&a))'. 

The operation T&!T is always F because the AND operation between 'True' and 'not True' is 'False', this simplifies the formula to:
  
'T|!(F&a)'.

Step 2: Simplify ((v|(v&T))&T

   v&T = v (Anything AND with True gives the own value)
   Therefore, the expression v|(v&T) = v|v = v(v OR v just equals v)
   So finally the simplification is v&T. But also we have the same rule here and that is v. 

Step 3: Simplify (T|(F&(f&((F|T)&(F|F))))

   The whole expression under the innermost parentheses makes the whole statement to be false, since F|F = F.
   So we have F&(f&F), which makes the whole expression False.
   As a result, the simplification of (T|(F&(f&((F|T)&(F|F)))))) = T. 

Step 4: Now we get ((z&v)|F)|T.

- A not False operation is equivalent to a True value, so (!F) will be always True;

This means we can simplify the formula to:

Also because the OR operation with False leaves the other operand unchanged, the part with the OR operation can be reduced:
(!((y&y) & F));

The value of y AND y is y, so the formula will become:

3. Similarly, the term ((T|T)|F)) also simplifies to True since True OR anything is True.

4. The term ((F&((!F)|F)) simplifies to False since False AND anything is False.

5. This also simplifies (F|(F&((T|T)|F))) to False, because it translates to False OR False is False.

3) 'Not' operator (!): It reverses the value of its input. 

So, let's simplify the formula:

F|T simplifies to T because the output of a logical 'or' operation is 'True' if either of the operands is 'True'. 

F|(!T) simplifies to F because '!T' will be 'False' and, as mentioned, logical 'or' operation with 'False' will keep the original value. 

So far, we'll replace inside and get:

!((F|(T|(((T&F)|(T&F))&T)))&((F|(F|(T&F)))&T))

Don’t forget about the definition: T&F simplifies to F because the output of a logical 'and' operation is 'True' only when both of the operands are 'True'. 

So we simplify further down to:

!((F|(T|((F|F)&T)))&((F|(F|F))&T))

5. Double negation (!!A) gives A itself.

Let's simplify the given expression. 

((T&(((((p|(p&p))&(T&(e&F)))|F)|F)&(F|(!(!F)))))&T)&(T|((t|t)&F))

Since, (t|t) = t and, any expression AND-ed with F gives F. So, ((t|t)&F) = F. 

The simplified expression is: 

(T&(((((p|(p&p))&(T&(e&F)))|F)|F)&(F|(!(!F)))))&T)&(T|F), reduced to T&(((((p|(p&p))&(T&(e&F)))|F)|F)&T)&T

Since e&F = F, ((p|(p&p))&(T&(e&F))) = (p|(p&p))&F = F.

Now the expression simplifies to:

T&(F|F)&T = T&F&T = T&F = F

So, the simplified logical formula is F.",F,F

Applying the operation of NOT F, we get T, yielding !((!T)|F)||(((!((T&F)|F)&((F|T)|F))|T)|T).

So now the expression inside the first NOT operation simplifies to (T|F) which is always T.

Then the second NOT operation causes it to simplify to F.

So now the expression on the left simplifies to F||(((!((T&F)|F)&((F|T)|F))|T)|T).

Then we simplify the T&F in the middle, which results in a False, yielding: 
F||(((!(F|F)&((F|T)|F))|T)|T).

So now the expression inside the second OR operation simplifies to (F|F) which is always F, yielding: F||((!(F&((F|T)|F)))|T)|T).

Since OR is inclusive, F OR T equals to TRUE, yielding: F||((!(F&F))|T)|T).

Applying the AND operation for F&F, we get False, yielding:

F || ((!(F))|T)|T.

The NOT in the middle causes it to simplify to T, resulting in the expression being F||T|T, which equals T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. In ""|"" (logical OR) operation, if any of the operands is true, the result is True. Hence, (T|(T|(F|(!F)))) simplifies to True because one operand is True. The same rule applies for (F|T) which also simplifies to True. 

2. In ""&"" (logical AND) operation, if any of the operands is false, the result is False. Hence, ((F|F)&(F&F)) simplifies to False because one operand is False. 

3. ""!"" (logical NOT) operation inverts the logical state. So, (!(l|(!((F|T)&((F|F)&(F&F))))) is equivalent to (!l).

4. Now the whole expression becomes ((f&(f|F))&(F|True|(!l))). We know that (f|F) simplifies to f because OR operation with False returns the same operand. And (F|True) simplifies to True because OR operation with True always results in True.

5. So, your expression is now ((f&f)&(True|!l)), which further simplifies to (f & (True | !l)) because in AND operation with same operands, the result is the same operand.

    b. F | F = F, F | T = T, T | F = T, and T | T = T. In words, OR gives True when either or both the conditions are True; it gives False only when both of them are False.

Step 2: Since ""!F"" equals T, (T&!F) simplifies to (T&T).  Also, ""anything AND True equals to anything"". Therefore (T&T) simplifies to T. So the equation could be simplified further to (T|T), which equals to T.

Step 4: Also, (((u|F)&F)|T)&F) simplifies to ((u&F)|T)&F, and since ""anything AND False equals to False"" and ""anything OR True equals to True"", the expression simplifies to T&F which equals F.

   Since you are having T|h in brackets, this turns into T and leaves you with (T|(F&(T&F))) or (T|(F&F)). Both ""T&F"" and ""F&F"" are F, so you end up with T|F which gives T.

Thus, we get a simplified formula as follows:

The whole expression now is ((f&f)|((!g)&F)). The expression (!g & F) will always be False because True and False is always False. So, we can further simplify the expression to (f&f)|F, which is simply f.",f,f

(((k&T)&k)&(k&((((w&w)&(((w|(F&F))&(!(F&F)))|(F&F)))|T)|(!(T&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's consider the operands with ""T"" and ""F"".

1. Since anything AND with true (T) is itself, (k&T) = k. 
2. Also, anything AND with false (F) is false (F), so (F&F) = F.
3. Anything OR with false (F) is itself, so (w|F) = w. 
4. Not False is True, so !(F&F) = !(F) = T. 
5. Not True is False, so !(T&T) = !(T) = F.

Replace these into the original expression:

((k&k)&(k&(((w&w)&(w&T|F))|T|F)).

Now let's consider the remaining operations. 

1. Duplicating AND operation won't change the outcome (k&k) = k.
2. Operand OR with True itself will become True, so (w&T|F) = (w|F) = w, and (T|F) = T. 

Replace these into the expression:

(k&(k&(w&T|F))).

Finally, let's simplify for the expression we got.

1. k&k = k
2. k&w = w

So the simplest form for the original logic formula is w.",w,k

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!((T&T)|T)|F) simplifies to F since (!((T&T)|T) is False and False OR False is False.
2. So, (((n|((((m|m)&T)&F))&(n|(F)))&(n|F))|F) simplifies to F since anything AND with F is F, and F OR F is F.
3. (w|F) simplifies to w since anything OR with F is the same thing.
4. ((w|F)|T) simplifies to T since anything OR with T is T.
5. Therefore, (((((n|((((m|m)&T)&F))&(n|(F)))&(n|F))|F)|((w|F)|T)) simplifies to T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F&T is False: any logical value AND with False results in False.
2. h|(F|(g&F)) is the same as h|F which is simply True. This is because any logical value OR with False retains its original value, and any logical value OR with True is always True. 
3. (h&(h|h))|F is equivalent to h|F, which is h. This is because a logical value AND with itself is always the same value, and any logical value AND or OR with False is always the original value.
4. !(((h|(F|(g&F)))&(h&(h|h))|F))|T) is equivalent to !(True&h)|T which simplifies to !h|T.
5. z|(F&T)|!h|T this simplifies to z|False|!h|T which further simplifies to z|!h|T. This is equivalent to True, because any logical value OR with True is always True.

((F&(T&((F&T)&F)))&((o&(((!(T&((z|F)|(F|T))))|(F&((T|T)|F)))&F))&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify from innermost parentheses:
- F&T is always F
- T&F is F
- The results F&F, F&T, T&F are all equal to F.
- z|F is equal to z because false doesn't affect the ""or"" operation.
- T|T is equal to T
- Therefore, !T&((z|F)|(F|T)) simplifies to !T&z.

We can now substitute these results back in and continue to simplify:
- The first part F&(T&F) simplifies to F because F&T is F.
- o&F equals to F (anything ""and"" false is false).
- F&F is also F.

So, the original complex statement simplifies to F&F, which is simply F, regardless of the truth values of o and z.",F,F

((v|((v|F)|F))&((h&(((((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) First, let's clarify the semantic of symbols: v is a logical variable that can be either True or False, 'F' means False and 'T' means True. The '|' symbol stands for logical OR, '&' stands for logical AND and '!' stands for logical NOT.

2) Now, let's start to simplify from inside out. '(F&F)' will always be False, and 'F&T' also yields False. Hence, we get:

   ((v|((v|F)|F))&((h&(((((T&False))&T)|F)|(!(False)))|(!T)))|T))
   
   ((v|((v|F)|F))&((h|True)|T))

3) According to logical laws, if some value is OR'ed with False, the result is equal to the value, and if some value is OR'ed with True, the result is always True. Also The conjunction (AND operator '&') is also true when both its operands are true. Hence, (True & anything) remains the same(value of 'anything') . So, we can further simplify the expression to:

   (v & (h | True) | T)
   
   (v & True | T)

4) Now, (v & True) simplifies to v, (anything | T) simplifies to True. Hence, the final simplification is:

   v | T
   
   T

So, no matter what values variables take, the given logical formula always represents True.",T,v

3. (w|T)&F simplifies to F, as anything AND-ed with F is F.
4. Then our expression becomes F|((!(!(((w&F)|((F&T)|(F&T)))&F)))|T)|F).
5. (((w&F)|((F&T)|(F&T)))&F) simplifies to F because w&F is F, F&T is F, so we have F|F which is F and then F&F is also F.

2. Any element AND with False (F) gives False (F), and any element OR with True (T) gives True. Therefore: !(T|(b&b)|(T|F)) simplifies to !T or F, and (F&T) simplifies to F. Thus, the above simplifies to (e&e&e&l&e&e)|F|F which is e&e&e&l&e&e or e.
