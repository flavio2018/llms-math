A: Let's think step-by-step.","The simplification of the logic formula is a step-wise process:

1. Remove redundancy: for any value P, (P|P) can be reduced to P and (P&P) can be reduced to P.

2. Look for T&F and F&T because these are always False. So, T&F is equivalent to F.

3. T&any_value is equivalent to any_value because T doesn't affect the result.

4. F|any_value is equivalent to any_value because F doesn't affect the result.

5. !T is F and !F is T.

Simplifying the given formula with these facts:

Starting with (((m|((m&T)|((((m&(((T&T)|T)&(!(T&F))))&T)&((m|(T&F))&T))|(m|m))))|m)&(m|((i|F)&F))) turns into:

2. Also, anything OR True (T) results in the value True So, T&T, T|T and w|T are all True (T).

3. Also, anything AND True will result in the same value (like X & T will results in X). So, F & T results in F.

4. Furthermore, False AND anything will always be False (F&x = F). So, F&T, F&F, T&F and F&j all result in False. 

5. Finally, any value OR False results in the same value (X|F = X).

Using these conclusions in given expression, gives us the simplified form:

Anything ORed with False remains the same ((T|F) gives T) and similarly (F|F) gives F. So it simplifies as

Anything ANDed with False is False ((t&F) gives F). So, it simplifies as 
(!((k|((k&(k|F))&((F|T)))|(F|T))).

Anything ORed with True results in True. So, it simplifies as 
(!((k|((k&(k|F))&T)|T)).

Anything ANDed with True remains the same ((k&T) gives k). So we get 
(!((k|(k&(k|F))|T)).

Anything ORed with False remains the same ((k|F) gives k). So we get

(k&k) gives k, because anything 'ANDed' with itself is just itself. So we get

2. Any statement or ""True"" is always True.
From the formula in step 3, (F|(F&True)) simplifies to False|False = False.

3. Logic not ""!F"" is True, and ""!T"" is False. So, in the formula (!(!F)) simplifies to !True = False and (v|(!(!F))) simplifies to v|False = v.

1. anything AND with False (F) will be False.
2. anything OR with True (T) will be True.
3. Double negation: not(not(A)) is equivalent to A.
4. anything AND with True is itself.

We start from the inside:

!(F&F) will be T (since F&F is F, and !F is T), so that section simplifies to s&T, which simplifies further to s.

The outermost section becomes ((F&!((s|F)&T))|(!(w&T)&T)).

This simplifies further to ((F&!(T))|(!(w&T)&T)).

Using rule 1 above, F&!T, is F, while rule 4 implies that !(w&T)&T is simply !(w&T).

   Accordingly: 
    - T|T = True
    - Any X|F is X
    - T|X is True for any X
    - Any F&X and X&F is False

2. Using the above facts, let's simplify the formula from innermost. We replace ""T"", ""F"" and variable with their corresponding values as explained above:

    - Simplifying o&F will give you False, because anything ANDed with False is False.
    - !(o&F) gives us the NOT value of False which is True.

    - Again, simplifying ((e|e)|F) will give you e because anything ORed with False is the same element.
                                      
    Then we are left with: l&(l&(g&(e&True)&(e|e)&e|True)) | (k|(T&T)|T))
    
3. Now, let's simplify further:

    - as T&T = T, so (k|(T&T)|T) become k|True, and anything ORed with True will be True.
    - e&True = e and (e|e) = e, so we can rewrite the formula as: l&(l&(g&e&e&e|True)) | True

2. Not True (!T) equates to False. So, we can simplify all (!T) expressions as False.
3. Not False (!F) equates to True, so we can simplify all (!F) expressions as True.
4. Also, anything AND False equates to False, so (F&T) = F. This makes (!(T&F)) into !F, which is True.
5. Now, anything OR False equates to the same entity, so (c|(!(T&(F&T)))) = c|True. This simplifies into True.

3. `(o|o)` as well as `(o&((o|o)|F))` simplifies to `o`, so the part `(o&((o|o)|F)` simplifies to `o`.
4. Any variable AND False `(a&F)` is always false and similar for or operation `(a|F)` will return the boolean value of 'a',
5. Also, any variable AND True `(a&T)` or OR True `(a|T)` is always true.

2. Anything or-ed(!) with false(F) does not change its value.So,k|F can be replaced with k.

3. For the AND(&) operation, ""T & T & any value"" just equals this value itself. So, (((t|(t&T))|T)&T) simplifies to T. 

4. Also, anything AND-ed(&) with true(T) does not change its value so (k&T)&k and (k|(F&T)) also equals to k.

2. Anything logically and'd with false (F) will also be false (F) ((k&F) =F, (q&F)=F, (u&F)=F). Thus our expression simplifies to:

(F | (F | (F&(!F&(F)&(!F|((s&T)|((s|F)&(s&T))))))))

3. Now, anything logically and’d with true remains unchanged, and anything logically 'and'ed with false will be false ((F&!F)=F). Also, anything logically 'or'ed with true becomes true, and anything logically 'or'ed with false remains unchanged ((s|F)=s, (F|F)=F, (T|T)=T). So our expression simplifies to:

F|F equals F, because at least one condition has to be true for the result to be true. In this case, both are false so the result is false.

First we simplify within the inner parentheses.

!(F|(F&T)) equals !(F|F) because T&F equals F. Then !(F|F) equals !F which is T because the statement is the opposite of false. Therefore, the entire statement is true (T).

Second we simplify within the middle parentheses.

So the equation (u&u)|(F&F))&T can be simplified first by realizing that u&u is u because a statement and itself is just the statement. Then F&F is just F. So the simplified equation is u|F&T. u|F can be simplified to just u because a statement or false is just the statement. Therefore, the simplified version of the original equation is u&T. 

F&F equals F. 

Therefore, we have F, T, F, and, finally, T|T&T which is equivalent to T as a statement or itself and itself is just the statement.

Simplify the AND with F:

Apply X & F = F:

Apply X & T = X, and X | F = X:

Apply X | F = X:

= F | (!d | !(i&(i&i)&i))

Apply X & F = F:

The expression o&o is redundant because something AND'd with itself is just itself. Hence, o&o can be simplified to o.

- ""T | F"" is T.

(((F&((F)&((((o&T)&((T)|((T|(F&T))&(T&(T)))))&T)&(T&F))))|T)&(F|((n&F)|T)))

From the rules, we know F & whatever = F. So the part F&((F)&((((o&T)&((T)|((T|(F&T))&(T&(T)))))&T)&(T&F)))) simplifies to F. Also ((n&F)|T) simplifies to T as n&F is (unknown)&F = F, and F|T = T. So we get:

(F|T)&(F|T)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: Simplify the logical operations that involve constants T (True) and F (False). 

We have the following identities:
- Any value OR True is always True (v | T = T).
- Any value OR False is the same value (v | F = v).
- Any value AND True is the same value (v & T = v).
- Any value AND False is always False (v & F = F).
- NOT True is False (!T = F).
- NOT False is True (!F = T).

Using these identities, we get the following:

((T|T)|F) simplifies to T.

((F&(o&(T&F))) simplifies to F.

(T&((F|T)&F)) simplifies to F.

((T&F)|T) simplifies to T.

(e&F) simplifies to F.

(F&(T&F)) simplifies to F.

So the original expression becomes:

!((T|(!T))&F) & (F|F)

Which further simplifies to:

(!(T&F)) & F

Step 2: Apply the identities again.

(T&F) simplifies to F.

So the expression becomes:

!F & F

Step 3: Again apply the identities.

!F simplifies to T.

So the expression finally simplifies to:

Step 4: One last time, apply the identity.

T & F simplifies to F.

Then, the expression: (((t&F)&T)&T)|T

Next: w & ! (T & (t & T) | T)
Simplifies to w & F, as T AND anything is that thing and T OR anything is T, and not T is F.
This further simplifies to just F because anything AND'd with F is F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the redundant OR operations. For any literal 'o', 'o|o' will always be equivalent to 'o'. 

So let's simplify '((o|(o|o))|F)' to 'o'.

Next, let's simplify 'T&T' which is equivalent to 'T' (True AND True = True).

So '!(T&T)' simplifies to '!T' which is equivalent to 'F' (Not True = False).

So, this simplifies '((!(T&T))|(F|(((T&(!T))&T)|(F|((((x|F)&T)|((x&x)&x))&F)))))' to 'F'. 

So, this simplifies 'o&(o|((!(T&T))|(F|(((T&(!T))&T)|(F|((((x|F)&T)|((x&x)&x))&F)))))' to 'o&o' which is equivalent to 'o' (o AND o = o).

Then, look at '(x|F)', 'x|F' is equivalent to 'x' since 'False OR x' is always 'x'.

2. Similarly, anything AND-ed by T is the same thing. So, ((n&T) simplifies to n. 

3. Further, anything OR-ed by T is T. Therefore, ((!T)&T)|T simplifies to T and (((T|(F&F))|T)|F) simplifies to T as well. 

4. Notice also that the bitwise AND of x and its bitwise complement (denoted as !x) always yields false. Therefore, (!T)&T simplifies to F. 

5. The expression then becomes: !((n&w)&(!(u&T)&(T&T)&T)).

6. Further simplifications using similar laws give: !((n&w)&(!u&T&T)). As previous, anything AND-ed by T is the same thing. 

7. This gives us: !((n&w)&(!u)).

- F & F is F, F | F is F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The term (T & (F & T)) evaluates to False because T & F is False and anything AND False is False. So the formula becomes:
   (F | (((F&(((((g|T)|F)&T)&T)&T))|(!(((x&(!((!(!F))|((F|F)&T))))|F)&F)))&F)).

2. In the term (((g|T)|F)&T)&T), the sub term ((g|T)|F) evaluates to T because whatever boolean value of g, g or T will always be T. This changes the formula to: 
   (F | ((F&((T&T)&T))|(!(((x&(!((!(!F))|T))))|F)&F)))&F).

3. (T & T & T) evaluates to True because True AND True is always True. This changes the formula to: 
   (F | ((F&T)|(!(((x&(!(!F)))|F)&F)))&F).

4. F&T again evaluates to False and not of False or !F is True. So the formula now became:
   (F | (F|(!((x&True)|F)&F))&F).

5. Then, (x & True) evaluates to 'x' because anything AND True gives the same thing again. So we get:
   (F | (F|(!((x|F)&F))&F).

6. (x | F) can be simply represented by 'x' and so the formula simplifies to: 
   (F | (F|(!(x&F))&F)).

7. (x & F) can be directly evaluated as False as per AND logic and taking NOT of it results in True. Now the formula becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","In a logic formula, T & F and F & X (where X is any value, either true or false) always evaluate as False. Similarly, T | X and F | X always evaluate as True and X, respectively. The negation operator !, when placed before a value, inverses the truth value of the articulated proposition. 

Solve the expression inside the innermost brackets first:

T & F = F
Then, l & F = F
T & (l & F) or T & F = F
So, F or F = F

Thereafter, F | (T & F) becomes F | F, which equals F
So, T | F = T
Then, F | T = T

At the second level of brackets, we have 

T & F = F
So, i & F = F
Then, T & F = F
After using 'not', !F = T
Further, T & T = T
This converts to: not T = F 

Then, 

m & F = F
So, T | F = T
Then, F | T = T
After using 'not', !T = F

So, the expression in the second level of brackets equals F & T = F

Consequently, !F = T

(z|(z|(z|z)) can be simplified to z as any clause ""or"" with itself will be itself.

z&z is similar as above, it is z 

(T&(F&(T&T))) is F since True & False = False

(F|(F|F)|F) simplifies to F since any clause ""or"" with False remains itself.

F&(T&F) is equal to F since False & anything is False

So, (((((z&z)|F)&(!((T&(F&(T&T)))&((F|(F|F))|F))))&T)|(F&(T&F)))&z) can be generally rewritten as z & T & z which is simply z since True & something equals to something.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify using some basic logic rules:

  First, we can remove any ‘F’ from the ‘or’ (‘|’) operators as ‘F|X’ = ‘X’. 

The given expression simplifies to:

((l|(((l|((F|(((p|F)&(F&T))|F))&(F|!T)))|F)&l))|(F|((F|(T&T))|T))).

It simplifies even further to:

(l|(((l|((F|((p&F)|F))&!T))&l))|(T).

Next, we can simplify any time we have ‘T’ in the ‘and’ (‘&’) operation, because ‘T&X’ = ‘X’:

So, let's simplify:

((l|(((l|((p&F))&!T))&l))|(T).

This simplifies to:

(l|(((l|(!T))&l))|T).

But, !T = F. We can substitute this value in, to get:

(l|(l&l)|T).

And in Logical Operations X & X = X:

We can simplify further to:

(l|l|T),

which equals:

l|T.

Then we know that X|T = T because regardless of the value of X, at least one of it and True is True.

1. T & F = F, because it fulfills the AND operation only when both values are true.
2. T | F = T, because it fulfills the OR operation if any value is true.

4. F & T = F, as AND operation fulfills only when both values are true.
5. (!F) = T, not false equals true.
6. F | T = T, as OR operation fulfills if any value is true.

So, the given formula simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any statement and its negation (e.g., P and !P) will always yield false (e.g., F & T = F). So any ((F&T) can be simplified as F. Given this, the expression can be simplified as follows:

    ((!F)&F) can be simplified as F.
    Thus the expression becomes: (F | !((F|T)&(F|F))).

2. Anything or False is equal to the original value, so (F|F) can be simplified as F. Therefore, the expression becomes: 

    (F | !((F|T)&F)).

3. The expression (F|T) will always be True, since no matter what F might be, true or false, inclusive OR with True will always be True (T). The expression therefore simplifies to:

    (F | !(T&F)).

4. Again, Anything & False is equal to False , so (T&F) simplifies to F and our expression becomes:

Second, (F|T) is T because logical or | with at least one True value results in True.

So, (!(!r|(F|T)) results in (!(!r|T) which equals to T because (!(!r) is T.

Then, !F equal to T and F&T equal to F because logical and & with False results in False.

So, ((t&(F|T))&(F&(T|T)) gives (t&T)&F because F|T results in T, so (t&T)&F results in F because any logical and operation & with False results in False .

3. Also, any value logically and-ed with T gives the same value. So, the part ""(d&(d|(d&d)))|T"" simplifies to ""T"".

4. We have ""g|T"" and ""!T|T"". The logical ""or"" gives true (T) if any of the conditions is true. So both of these are definitely true (T).

 - !(n&T) is !n|!T which is !n (because !T or not True equals to False).

![False &(d&(!True))] → F&d → F.
[F&(F&(((F&F)&(!True))|(False|True)))] → F.
[d&(!True)] → d&F → F.

We also know that !True is equivalent to F (False), so let's simplify that:
[!(F|(d&F))] → !(F|F) → !F.
[F&((!F)&True))] → F&True → F.
[((F&F)&F)|(F|True)] → F|True → True.

- `x | T = T` for any x (True OR anything is True)

- `T | F = T`
- `F | F = F`
- `T & T = T`
- `F & x = F` for any x (False AND anything is False)

4. So far we can simplify the previous formula to: ((T&(T&((T&((!(!T))&((g&T)&T)|F))|F))|((T&(w|T))|T))
5. (!(!T)) will be T, so the formula simplifies to: ((T&(T&((T&T&((g&T)&T))|F))|((T&(w|T))|T))

Therefore, '!F & (T|T)' becomes '!F & T' which is just 'T'. '(T & T)' or 'T & F' can be simplified to 'T' and 'F' respectively.
Now, putting these simplifications back in our main logic formula, we get:

This simplifies to : 

((w|F)|(w|u&F))|T) & F          [ where 'F&u' becomes 'F']

`(!((T & ((F & ((!((T | F) | (t | ((r & T) | T))))) | (F & F)))) & (((w | F) | w) | T))`.

Step 2: A logical Or ""|"" between any value A and True, gives True so replace ""((r & T) | T)"" and ""(((w¡F) | w) | T)"" with T:

`(!((T & ((F & ((!((T | F) | (t | T)))))) & T))`.

Step 3: For ""T | F"", T wins, replacing it with T provides:

`(!((T & ((F & (!T | (t | T)))))) & T)`.

Step 4: Negate value T ""!T"" becomes F:

`(!((T & ((F & (F | (t | T)))))) & T)`.

Step 5: No matter what value 't' is, ""F or T"" will give True i.e. ""(F | (t | T))""  so we get:

`(!((T & F) & T)`.

Step 6: Again ""T & F"" simplifies to F, so this gives us:

`(!(F & T))`.

- The expression ((!T)) is always equal to F because the negation of T (True) is F (False).
- The expression ((anything&T)) is always equal to anything because ""and"" operation with T does not change the value.
- The expression ((anything|F)) is always equal to anything because ""or"" operation with F does not change the value.

The simplification of the statement step by step is given below:

1. Start with the given expression: ((T|((((F&(k|T))&F)|((((x&(((!T)|(T|T))&T))&((x|(!T))|F))&T)&F))&F))&((F&(!T))|T))
2. Simplify it considering the rules above: ((T|(F&F))&(F|T))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can eliminate the ""or"" operations with False and ""and"" operations with True with any other value because these will not change the initial value. Also, we can simplify multiple logical negations and repeated logical conjunctions or disjunctions. 
In addition, the operation logical not with False turns into True and with True turns into False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","In the given formula there are a number of logical operations performed on True (T) and False (F). We know that:

- !F is equivalent to T
- T&F or F&T is equivalent to F
- T|F or F|T is equivalent to T
- Any statement OR with F is equivalent to that statement (i.e., a|F = a)
- Any statement AND with T is equivalent to that statement (i.e., a&T = a)

Now, using these equivalences, let's simplify:

(!(!(F|(F&T))) can be simplified to !(!F) which is further simplified to T.

(F&(T|(T|(((q|q)&((q&((T|F)|(F&T)))&(q|(q|F))))|(!F)))) can be simplified to F&(((q|q)&q)&(!F)) (by simplification of T|X => T and A&F => F where A and X are any statements).

This can further be reduced to F due to F&X to be F (X is any statement).

3. (d|(((((b|b)&(b|b))&b)|F)&F)) simplifies to d, because ((((b|b)&(b|b))&b)|F)&F simplifies to F and d or F is d.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the nested and/or logical operators that enclose T or F. 

- T&any expression = any expression and F&any expression = F
- T|any expression = T and F|any expression = any expression
- !T = F and !F = T
- Using these rules, we get:

((j & ((F & (T)) | T)) & ((T & (!(i | (T)))) | T)).

Now, we continue with simplification:

-  (F & T) is F,
- (False | T) is T, 
- (!i | T) is T, 
- (T & T) is T,  
- (T | T) is T, 

That is, the original formula is simplified to:

(j & T & T)

or

(j & T) which is equivalent to j, if 'j' is True then the expression will be True else it will be False.",j,j

(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, simplify the subexpression (!(!T)). Here, T stands for True and ! stands for logical not, i.e. negations. !(!T) means not of not True, which simplifies to True.

Secondly, we should realize that the expression (T|T) simplifies to T (or True), because in OR operation if at least one value is True, then the result is True.

Thirdly, we simplify the expression (!T), which is not True, or False (F).

Fourthly, since T|F equals to T (true OR false is true), but for any logic value s, s&F equals to F, and s&T equals to s. So the expression (s&(T|(!(T|T)))) is equals to s, and the expression ((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T) equals to F.

Finally, we arrive at the conclusion that the whole expression simplifies to s. So, (((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T))) simplifies to s.",s,s
