((F&((n&n)&T)|((T|T)&T)))|T).

Then simplify n&n to n. Also, anything or False is simply the same thing, so simplify T|T to T. So we get:
((F&(n&T))|T) | T.

Then examine the sub-expression n & T. Since ""n"" can be true or false, and ""T"" is always true, ""n & T"" will be true if ""n"" is true and false otherwise which is same as ""n"". Therefore, we get:
((F&n)|T) | T.

Here F & n will be simply F since anything with false will be false. Therefore, we get:
F | T) | T.

We know, anything or True is always True so it further becomes:
T | T

2. A & B = F, if either A or B is F (Logical AND)
3. !A = T, if A is F (Logical NOT)

The steps are:

2. (!T) simplifies to F, because NOT True is False
3. (!T )| T simplifies to T, because OR returns True, if any operand is True (also we used step 2 here). 

Secondly, inside out, for compound expressions, the steps are:
1. ((x | F)& (((x&(x|x)) & x)|F)) simplifies to (x&x),  because OR operator with False returns the other operand in unchanged form, and AND operator with True also returns the other operand unchanged
2. (x & x) simplifies to x, because AND operation with the same variable will give that variable itself

((t & t) & (t | (t & (a | T | F))) & T)

We can simplify further by noting that (a | T | F) simplifies to T since (a | T) is T and (T | F) is T. Also note that (t & t) simplifies to t and something AND with T will result in the same term.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Understanding that the logical AND (symbolized as &) is only true when both operands are true, F&T will always be false, because F or False is never true.

Replace (F&T) with F and the logic formula becomes:
((u&(u&((u|(F&(!T)))&T)))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T)))

2. Now, logical negation or NOT (symbolized as !) negates the value of the operand, so !T or not true is equal to False (F).

Replace (!T) with F and our logic formula is:
((u&(u&((u|(F&F))&T)))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T)))

3. After the previous steps, we have a situation where we have (F&F), which is needed to simplify as False because 'And' condition requires both conditions to be True, which is not the case. 

So, the logic formula will become:
((u&(u&((u|F)&T)))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T)))

4. Whenever anything is OR'ed with False, the result is that anything because 'Or' condition requires either of the conditions to be True. In this case, if ""anything"" is True, the entire condition is True, even if False is never True. 

Substitute (u|F) with u and the formula will be:
((u&(u&(u&T)))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T)))

5. Now we have a situation where we have (u&T), which means that the value of u determines the value of the expression because T or True is always True.      
Replace (u&T) with u and the formula will be:
((u&(u&u))|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T)))

6. Now logical AND again is only true when both operands are true. Here we have u&u which can be simplified as u, because if u is True, the entire condition is True, and if u is False, the entire condition is False. 
Replace (u&u) with u and our formula now becomes:
(u|(!(((l&(T&T))&T)|T)))

7. We still have the following expression inside our formula: (l&(T&T)). 

Substitute (T&T) with T and our formula now becomes:
(u|(!((l&T)|T)))

8. We continue simplifying. Now, we have l&T which value will be determined by the value of l because T or True is always true, so replace the l&T by 'l'.

u|(!((l|T)))

9. And now, finally, the last expression is (l|T) which will always be true, because T or True is always true.

Replace l|T with T in the formula and we have:
u|(!(T))

10. The last step is to simplify NOT T or !T to be False.

Replace !(T) with F and our final, simplified logic expression is:

11. We look at a | a, which equals a (any Boolean value OR'ed with itself is itself)

12. We replace that value on the initial expression: ((True & False) | F) | (a | T)

13. We know that any Boolean value OR'ed with True is True, so (a | T) becomes True

14. We replace that value in the initial expression: ((True & False) | F) | True

15. We can now use AND on True & False, getting False (AND operation between True and False is False)

16. We replace that value in the initial expression: (False | F) | True

17. The result of OR operation between False and False is False

18. We replace that value in the initial expression: False | True

19. Finally, the result of OR operation between False and True is True

The logic formula then simplifies to: 

(!(F)&(!((T|(o|T))|(F|((F|T)|((F|T)&F)))))).

Then, lets consider !(F), this is logically equivalent to T (not False is True). 
Also, T|T is T (True or True is True), F|T is T (False or True is True) and (F|T)&F is F (False and True is False). Cconsidering these statements:

(!(F)&(!((T|(o|T))|(F|((F|T)|((F|T)&F))))))

becomes:

(T&(!((T|(o|T))|(F|(T|F)))))

Next, T|(o|T) is T (True or anything is True) and T|F is T.
Again, simplifying further, the formula becomes:

(T&(!(T|F)))

This simplifies to T&(!T), as T|F equals T.

Then apply the 'not' operation:

(!((False)|o|(c|(((n&False)|False)|True))))

Apply 'And' & 'Or' operations with False. X Or False = X and X And False = False. 

(!((False)|o|(c|((n|False)|True))))

Simplify further as the 'n' and 'False' no longer have any impact:

(!((False)|o|(c|True)))

'False' in 'Or' operation has no impact:

!F equals to T because not False equals to True. So, the formula simplifies to:

T OR T equals to T (since if either or both of the two are true, the result is true). So, the formula simplifies again to:

(T|(!((!(!(!(l|T))))|(z&(T&(F&(F&F)))))).

Looking at the second part of the formula: F&(F&F) equals F (since if any of the values is false, the result is false). So, the formula simplifies to:

(T|(!((!(!(!(l|T))))|(z&(T&F))))).

Next step: T&F equals to F (since if any of the values is false, the result is false). So, the formula simplifies to:

(T|(!((!(!(!(l|T))))|(z&F)))).
 
Next, z&F equals to F (since if any of the values is false, the result is false). The formula simplifies to:

(T|(!((!(!(!(l|T))))|F))).

We can simplify the inner notations: !(!(l|T)) equals to l|T. So, the formula simplifies to:

(T|(!((!(l|T))|F))).

Next, !(l|T) OR F equals !(l|T) since adding an OR F after a negation does not change the outcome. That simplifies the formula to:

2. Also, F|F = F. So, it reduces the expression further to F&(x|T), which becomes F&T since anything OR True remains True. Hence, that simplifies the left part of the expression to ((T&F)|F) which becomes F|F and simplifies to F.

3. Then, let's consider the right side of the expression. Inside the parentheses, l&F = F remains, regardless of the variable l's value. Hence, a|(l&F) is equals to a|F which simplifies to a.

4. Considering the T towards the end, this means it is also equates to a&T, which equals a since anything AND True remains the original value.

5. Hence, the right part of the expression simplifies to ((a&T)&a)|T. Since a&T equals a, that further simplifies to a|T, which equals T since anything OR True remains True. 

6. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to F&T which equals F.

(!((e&F)|T))

Next, any value anded with False gives False. So, e and F becomes F:

3. Any value logically ORed with True is True because True always dominates in a logical OR operation. Therefore, (T&(F|(s|(!F))) simplifies to True. 

4. Next, False logically ANDed with any value (T&F here) gives False because False dominates in the logical AND operation. Hence, ((F|(T&F))|F) simplifies to F.

5. Now the formula looks like this !((s|True)&(F|F)), which simplifies to !((s|True)&F) or !(True&F). 

6. Again, this simplifies to !(F), which is same as !F or True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting with T & F equals F because the and operator requires both its inputs to be true to output true. False is not true, hence T & F equals F. 

We can then replace T & F in our given formula, resulting in:

((!(((x|((x|F)|x))&F)&(!((!F)|F))))&(!F)).

Here, !F equals T because the ! operator basically inverts the input; hence !F is not False, which is True. 

We then get:

((!(((x|((x|F)|x))&F)&(!T)))&T).

Since x | F always equals to x, as anything 'or' False equals that thing (x), we can further simplify to:

((!(((x|x|x)&F)&(!T)))&T).

And, x | x | x can just be written as x:

((!(x&F)&(!T))&T).

From above, we know x & F equals F. Since multiplying by F, i.e., 'anding' with False, always equals False:

((!F&(!T))&T).

And, !F equals to T, therefore:

((T&(!T))&T).

We know !T is F, so:

((T&F)&T).

And, T & F equals F, so:

In this kind of operation, (f|f) also becomes just f, therefore, the operation simplifies to:
