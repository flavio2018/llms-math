A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we perform operations with constants.
Any expression OR True (X | T) is always True, because either X is True or otherwise True is True.
Similarly, any expression AND False (X & F) is always False, because either X is False or otherwise False is False.

So we simplify the constants:

((x&(x&((F|(k|T))&(((m|F)&((m&m)|(m|F)))|T))))|(F|(F&(l|T))))

= (x&(x&((F|T)&((m&((m&m)|(m)))|T)))) | (F|(F&l))

= (x&(x&(T&((m&((m&m)|(m)))))) | F

= x & x & m | F

= x & m.

2. We also have another rule: for any X, X & X = X.

So the final simplified version of logic formula is:

- T AND F evaluates to F,
- F AND F evaluates to F,
- X OR F evaluates to X,
- X AND F evaluates to F,
- X AND T evaluates to X,
- X means any part of the formula.

Upon applying these rules, we simplify the input to:

Whenever you see !F, the result is T.
Whenever you see f|F, the result is f.
Whenever you see f&f, the result is f.

So the given logic formula simplifies as follows:

Step 1: ((f&((((f|F)|((f&f)&((f&T)|(F&T))))|f)&(f&(!F))))&(F|(z|T))) represents ((f&((((f)|((f&f)&((f)|(F))))|f)&(f&(T))))&(F|(z|T))).

Step 2: ((f&((((f)|((f)&((f)|(F))))|f)&(f&(T))))&(F|(z|T))) represents ((f&((((f)|((f)&(f)))|f)&(f))))&(F|(z|T))).

Step 3: ((f&((((f)|((f)|(f)))|(f))))&(F|(z|T))) represents ((f&(((f)|(f))))&(F|(z|T))).

Step 4: ((f&((f)))&(F|(z|T))) represents (f&(F|(z|T))).

Replace your above solutions:

- (!T) is F (taking the logical not of True is False)
- F|(!T) is F (False OR False is always False)

Using these simple substitutions, our formula simplifies to:

Next, we continue to simplify with the following operations:

- T|F is T (since True OR anything is always True)
- F&T is F (because False AND anything is always False)

So our formula simplifies further to:

Then, anything AND False is always False. This makes f & F is equal to F, so now the expression becomes (j | !(T | F)) | (F & T).

We have that any value OR False equals the original value, thus (T | F) is equal to T, which simplifies the expression to (j | !T) | (F & T).

Since any value OR with not itself equals True, (!T | T) would be True but here we have (!T) which is equal to False, thereby making the expression (j | F) | (F & T).

Again, anything OR False is itself, so the expression becomes (j) | (F & T).

The formula b&F is F. Therefore, ((t&F)&(u|!F)) becomes ((t&F)&(u|T)), which simplifies to ((F)&(u|T)).

Then, our formula becomes:

4) ((F&F)|(o|(!(F)&F))))

Again, we see that 'F&F' is F, '!F' is T.

Therefore, the formula transforms into:

5) (F|(o|(T&F)))

From 'T&F' we get F, then our formula becomes:

6) (F|(o|F))

2. Now the formula (T&F) will always be False, so the expression simplifies to

Step 2: Further simplification using absorption law where 'X&X' or 'X|X' is equivalent to 'X'.

Step 4: We know 'h&F' and 'X&F' is 'F', and '!c|T' will yield 'T' (since OR operation with any element and True yields True).

Step 5: This further simplifies to r&T | r&F by using the law 'X|F' is 'X' and 'X&T' is 'X'.

So the formula becomes:
(((((o|(F&(True|F)))&o)|o)&T)|((F&(!(F&(!(u|(T|T))))))|T))

Then we simplify (True|F):
(True|F) is obviously True.
 
This will result in these changes:
(((((o|(F&True))&o)|o)&T)|((F&(!(F&(!(u|(T|T))))))|T))

And (F&True) equals F, because F (False) dominates over T (True) in logical and.

This leads to:
(((o&o)|o)&T)|((F&(!(F&(!u))))|T)

Then we simplify !(F&!u) and (F&()):
(F&!u) is F because F (False) dominates over !u in logical and.
So (regardless of whether its logically not), !(F&!u) is True.
(F&True) is F, because F (False) dominates over True in logical and.

Taking into consideration these simplifications we get: 
(((o&o)|o)&T)|(F|T)

We can simplify (o&o) into o because o&o equals o (they are the same boolean variable).

So, we have:
((o|o)&T)|(F|T)

We simplify ((o|o)&T) into (o&T) because each ""o"" stands for the same value.
But, (F|T) simplifies to T, because or operation with True always results in True.

Therefore, final simplification is:

However, we can further simplify it considering that the whole expression will always be True regardless of whether the first part (o&T) is True or False, due to ""|T"". So final form is:

3. Whenever `something & F` is calculated, the result will be `F`. So, `(T|((i|(m|T))&F))` simplifies to `T|F` that simplifies to `T`.

Therefore, the original expression further simplifies to `(((f|T)|(f|(f&((f&(f&T))|F)&f)))|T)`.

4. Let's now simplify the expression `(f&(f&T))`. Because `something & T` is equal to `something`, this expression reduces to `f&f`, which equals to `f`.

With these in mind, let's proceed:

- F|(T&T) will simplify to F|T because 'true AND true' is 'true'. 'false OR true' will simplify to 'true' (because only one needs to be true for the entire statement to be true). 
- F|(F|(T|T)) is like saying 'false OR false OR true', is 'true'. 

So, we have:

Next, we simplify further:

- l|T will be T, because 'any statement OR true' is true (regardless if the statement is true or false).
- T|!(T)|T is equal to T, because regardless of the NOT operator, having an OR operation with a TRUE value will return TRUE.

Finally, anything AND False or F is equivalent to F itself or the ""bottom"", since F is the absorbing element of conjunction. So we can simplify as follows:

x&(((x|F)&T)|x)) = x&(((x)&T)|x)) = x&((x)|x)) = x&(x).

x&((x&T)&(v|T)) = x&((x)&(v|T)) = x&(x) = x.

(((v|(F&T))&v)&(((((v|F)&((v|(F&F))|(T|(F&F))))|(v|v))|v)&v))

Step 1) Simplify (F&T) and (F&F) to F because F & anything = F:

(((v|F)&v)&(((((v|F)&((v|F)|T))|v)|v)&v))

Step 2) Simplify (v|F) and (v|F) to v because F | anything = anything:

(((v&v)&(((((v)&v)&T)|v)&v))

Step 3) Simplify (v&v) to v, because anything & anything = anything:

(v&(((v&T)|v)&v))

Step 4) Simplify (v&T) to v, because T & anything = anything:

(v&((v|v)&v))

Step 5) Simplify (v|v) to v, because anything | anything = anything:

(v&(v&v))

Step 6) Simplify (v&v) to v, because anything & anything = anything:

(v&v)

Step 7) The final simplified logic formula is ""v"", because anything & anything = anything.",v,v

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, any value AND'ed with True (T&T) is that value itself, so the portion ""T&T"" is T.

Next, any value OR'ed with False (T|F) is that value itself, preserving the T.

Then ""l&((T|F)&(T&T))"" can be simplified to ""l&T"" which is simply ""l"" because any value AND'ed with True is that itself.

Besides, any value AND'ed with itself (like l&l) equals itself.

Finally, any value OR'ed with itself (like l|l) equals itself.

Hence, the entire expression simplifies to ""l"".",l,l
98,logic,self_consistency,((T|(F|F))|(F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T)))|(!(F&T))))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
((T|(F|F))|(F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T)))|(!(F&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, inside the parentheses ((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F))), we have g&F which equals F because ""and"" operation requires both values to be true in order to return true. Similarly, (p&F) equals to F and (T&F) equals to F. Therefore, the whole expression inside inner parentheses becomes F|F which again simplifies to F.

Next, look at the expression (T|T), which simplifies to T since ""or"" operation requires at least one true to return true.

So, the intermediate expression (T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T))) now simplifies to (T&(F|T)).

Further simplifying, since F or T equals T, this expression becomes T&T, which simplifies to T.

Look at (F&T). Because the ""and"" operation requires both values to be true in order to be true, this means F&T equals to F. Then ! operator negates it to T.

So, the expression (F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T)))|(!(F&T)))) simplifies to F&(T|T) which further simplifies to F&T, and then to F.

Finally, look at the whole original expression ((T|(F|F))|(F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T)))|(!(F&T))))). Now it becomes (T|F)|F. Since T or F equals T, the expression further simplifies to T|F, which simplifies to T. Therefore, original logic formula simplifies to T.",T,T

(!((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Take care of T and F values first. Since any value or T (o | T) equals T because T is like an identity for the OR operation. Similarly, F is the identity for the AND operation, so any value and F equals F. 

    Therefore, the expression changes to:
    !((T)&((F&(s&F))|(F&(!((F&T)&F))&F)).

2. F&(s&F) - F & anything is just F. (F&(!((F&T)&F))&F)) is also F because F & anything is F. 

    So, we simplify expression to:
    !((T)&((F)|(F))).

3. Now we can simplify (F)|(F) into F. Therefore, we get: 
    !(T & F).

4. Since T & F is just F because F & anything is F, so we simplify again to
    !(F).

5. Finally, since !(F) is just T because it negates the false to true, we are left with:
    T.

Therefore, the final output is T (True).",T,T
