A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve the inner expressions [MAX 6 3] and [MAX 9 5]. The MAX operator returns the maximum value, hence, [MAX 6 3]=6 and [MAX 9 5]=9. 

Then the equation becomes [SM [SM 6 9] [MIN [SM 8 8] [SM 2 7]]].

Next, let's move on to [SM 8 8] and [SM 2 7]. The SM operator performs a sum modulo 10, which means it adds the numbers and then takes the remainder when divided by 10.
So, [SM 8 8] results in 16 modulo 10 equivalent to 6 and [SM 2 7] results in 9 modulo 10 equivalent to 9.

The equation then becomes [SM [SM 6 9] [MIN 6 9]].

The MIN operator returns the minimum value, so [MIN 6 9] equals 6.

Let's substitute this into the equation: [SM [SM 6 9] 6].

Let's calculate [SM 6 9]. It results in 15 modulo 10 which equals 5. Hence, our final equation becomes [SM 5 6].
