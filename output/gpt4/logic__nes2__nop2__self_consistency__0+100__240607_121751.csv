The expression (f|F) would result in the value of f, because the OR operation between a value and False is just the original value. But, any OR operation with a True will always result in True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (d|d) simplifies to ""d"". If ""d"" is true, then ""d"" or ""d"" is true. If ""d"" is false, ""d"" or ""d"" is false. Hence (d|d) is equal to ""d"".
2. (e&F) simplifies to ""F"" because according to the semantics of logical and, if one of the operands is False, the whole expression is False regardless of the value of the other operand. Hence, (e&F) equates to ""F""

((n|F)&(c|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","At first, we can simplify `(n|F)` because any value or `n` OR `F` retains its original value. This is based on the idea that `n OR F` is always equal to `n` because if `n` is `T` the resulting value is `T` regardless of the `F`, and if `n` is `F` the resulting value is simply `F` as none of the ORed values are `T`. Thus, `(n|F)` simplifies to `n`.

Next, we simplify `(c|T)`. Any value `c` OR `T` is always `T`. This is because no matter what value `c` has (`T` or `F`), the presence of `T` in an OR operation always results in `T`. Thus, `(c|T)` simplifies to `T`.

Finally, we have the simplified formula: `(n&T)` which is equivalent to `n` if `n` is `F` and `T` if `n` is `T`. In other words, the value of `(n&T)` is always the value of `n`.",n,n

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical or (|) of True (T) with any other value (either True or False) will always be True, because only one branch of a logical OR needs to be true for the whole statement to be true. Therefore, (T|F) simplifies to T.

Also, a logical and (&) of any value with True (T) will always be that value, because for a logical AND, both branches need to be true, so if one branch is always true, the truth value of the entire statement depends on the other branch.
