94y + 64y simplifies to 158y

So our expression ((+37*y+74*y)+(+94*y+64*y)) turns into (111y) + (158y)

Next, we add the two terms: 111y + 158y equals 269y.

Then, we compute the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient. The coefficient of y is 269.

As the coefficient is positive, we perform modulo 100 of 269 which is 69.

Hence, the result is 69y.",69y,+69*y

((-7*a*b*x*y-60*a*b*x*y)+(-46*a*b*x*y-30*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, you add like terms within each parentheses:

In the first parentheses, you have -7*a*b*x*y and -60*a*b*x*y, which adds up to -67*a*b*x*y.

In the second parentheses, you have -46*a*b*x*y and -30*a*b*x*y, which adds up to -76*a*b*x*y.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to (-67*a*b*x*y) + (-76*a*b*x*y).

This can be simplified further by adding the like terms to get -143*a*b*x*y.

Now, to find the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient (-143), you take its remainder when divided by 100. However, since it's negative, you will use modulo -100. The remainder when -143 is divided by -100 is -43.

Therefore, the final simplified expression is -43*a*b*x*y.",-43*a*b*x*y,-43*a*b*x*y
99,algebra,self_consistency,((+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y)+(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y)),"Q: Simplify the following algebraic expression, computing the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient of each intermediate value if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative:
((+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y)+(+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we have two pairs of expressions, and we need to simplify each pair:

(5*a*b*x*y - 95*a*b*x*y) and (78*a*b*x*y - 48*a*b*x*y). 

Simplifying each, we get:

-90*a*b*x*y and 30*a*b*x*y respectively.

Now, applying the rule about forgetting negative signs for now and taking modulo 100, we get:

10*a*b*x*y and 30*a*b*x*y.

Next, we add these two values and we get:

40*a*b*x*y
After applying modulo operation on 40 which it is smaller than 100, we get the same value.

So, the final answer is 40*a*b*x*y.",40*a*b*x*y,-60*a*b*x*y
