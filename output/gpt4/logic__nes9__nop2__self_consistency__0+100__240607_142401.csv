1. T & F = F because AND operator will result in True only if both the operands are True else it will result in False.
2. F & T = F.
3. T & T = T.
4. F | T = T because OR operator will result in False only if both operands are False.
5. F & F = F.
6. Any literal & T or T & literal results in the literal itself.
7. Any literal & F or F & literal results in F.
8. Any literal | T or T | literal results in T.

As a result, (F&(F&(F|(F|(!F))))) is ""F"", because ""and"" operation with any ""false"" gives us false.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, replace all the occurrences of ""!T"" by ""F"" (since not true is false), and ""T&T"" by ""T"" (since true and true always is true), and ""F&T"" and ""T&F"" and ""((F&T)|(T&T))&F"" by ""F"" (since any expression with false in logical and is also false):

The simplified version of the expression opens up to be ""(F | ((!m & T) | (e | (z | F))))"".
  
Note that in a logical OR operation with False (A|F), the result will be just the other operand (in this case A). So ""z | F"" simplifies to ""z"".

Now we have: ""(F | ((!m & T) | (e | z)))"".

Also, applying the aforementioned rule to the whole expression, we get:

""(F | ((!m & T) | (e | z)))"" simplifies to ""((!m & T) | (e | z))"".

5. Since any literal AND with False results in False, the part (F & T) simplifies to F:

        (T | (T | F) & !F).

6. Any literal OR with True results in True, thus the above equation simplifies to T | (T & !F).

- F&T is always F.
- T|F is always T.

Next step:
- Every literal or False is always equal to the literal. In this case, every k|F is k.
- Every literal or True is always equal to True. In this case, j|T is T.

So the simplified equation is ((k&F)|(!(i&m&c&T|T))).

- Every literal and True is always the literal. So, &T from c&T becomes c.
- Every literal and False is always False. In this case  k&F is F.
- Any term “or” with T will always result in T. In this case, T or (any) = T.

- T|F and F|F|F are both True because at least one of the values is True in case of T|F and all are False in case of F|F|F, but we are doing an OR operation, so if even one of them is True, it results in True.
- !F is True because it's the negation of False.

Next, redefine the formula with these simplifications:
(t|(!False)) | (z|(((True)&T)|((T|True)&F)))&T)

Let's simplify this further:
- !False is True because it's the negation of False.
- Both T&F and T&T are False and True respectively because in an AND operation, if any of the value is False, it results in False.
- (T|True) is True because at least one of the values is True in OR operation.

So now the formula is:

Now simplify this further:
- As t OR True is always True (as OR operation results in True if at least one of the values is True).
- Similarly, True OR False is always True due to OR operation.
- And, True AND T becomes T because in case of AND operation, if both values are True, it results in True.

So now the formula is:
True | (z|True)&T.

Our next round of simplifications is as follows:
- z OR True is always True due to OR operation.

3. Any statement of the form `x | F` is always `x`. Therefore, we can replace: `F|((!(F&(((j&j)|j)&F)))|(v|(((!(!F))&F)|T)))` x `F|(!F|v)` and then to `F|F|v` and eventually to `F|v`.
4. ! operation gives opposite of the logical value. Since `F` is False, `!F` is `T` (True) and `!T` is `F`.

F & True is False because for AND operation both values must be True to result in True. Therefore, the first part of the expression simplifies to (False|False).

The second part of expression, (a & (a | (a | a))), simplifies to just (a & a), using the rule that A or A is equivalent to just A. Therefore, (a & a) results in just 'a'.

Now, the entire expression can be simplified as ((F|F) &(a|F)). Applying OR operation to F and F, we get False, and then applying AND operation to a and True, we get 'a'.

4. 'False | False': It is 'False' as both statements are 'False'.
5. '!False': It is 'True' as it is the negation of 'False'.
6. 'o | True': It is 'True' as one statement is 'True'.

8. 'True or False': It is 'True' as one statement is 'True'.
9. 'n & False': It is 'False' as one of the statements is 'False'.
10. Within the large parentheses, you have ""!F"" three times which simplifies to 'True'.
11. '(F&F)' simplifies to 'False'.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) First, we can simplify (!T) to F, because ""not true"" equals to False.
2) Similarly, we can simplify (F|F) or (F&F) to F, because ""False or False"" and ""False and False"" both equal to False.
3) Therefore, ((F|F)|F) also equals to False, so T&(((F|F)|F)&F) simplifies to False because ""True and False"" equals to False.
4) Next, any logic symbol ORed with itself will result in itself (i.e., (s|s) equals s), and anything ORed with False will result in itself, so (k|((k|(!T))|k)) simplifies to k.
5) Thus, ((k|((k|(!T))|k))&(T&(((F|F)|F)&F))) simplifies to k & False, which equals to False.
6) Again, anything ORed with False equals itself, so (((s|s)|((k|((k|(!T))|k))&(T&(((F|F)|F)&F))))|s) simplifies to s.
7) Since ((s|(s|s))|s) simplifies to s, the entire formula (((((s|s)|((k|((k|(!T))|k))&(T&(((F|F)|F)&F))))|s)&s)|((s|(s|s))|s)) simplifies to (s & s) OR s, which equals to s. Because ""s AND s"" gives s and anything ORed with itself equals itself.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting with all the instances of ""T"" and ""F"", we can simplify:

* ""!T"" gives us ""F""
* ""T|T"" is ""T""
* ""b|T"" is also ""T"" as anything OR true gives true
* ""T&F"" gives ""F"" and ""T&F"" gives ""F"" again. In both cases, anything AND false gives false.
* ""!F"" gives ""T""

So, the expression becomes:
((m&(T&((F|((T|F)&false))|T)))&(c|(T&(T|T))))&T)

We simplify again:

* ""T|F"" becomes ""T""
* ""F|F"" simplifies to ""F""
* ""T&F"" pulls up another ""F""
* ""T|(F|T)"" simplifies to ""T""
* ""T&(T|T)"" simplifies to ""T""

So, we get:
((m&T)&(c|T))&T

Continuing the simplification process:

* ""m&T"" is reduced to ""m"" because m AND true is m.
* ""c|T"" is reduced to ""T"" because anything OR true is true.

So we get: 
(m&T)&T

And simplifying further m&T becomes m (because m AND true is m) and also &T becomes nothing (because anything AND true is simply the original thing). The final simplified logic expression is:

Further, we simplify redundant expressions:

w&w = w (since, anything AND anything = that thing)

So the formula becomes :

So, the formula becomes:

Substitute these values back into the formula:

Further simplify:

F&T => F

Substituting these values again, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, since any value 'or' with itself equals to itself, we can simplify the expression g|g to just g. Similarly, we can simplify i|i to i. 

Then, we know that True AND False equals False. Therefore, F&T and T&(F&F) both equate to False. 

Using the principle of negation, we can see that !(T&False) equates to 'not False', which is True. 

So, we’ve simplified the initial logic formula to: (((g&g)|((((i&T)&(i&True)&(i&i)))&(False))&T)).

Since we know any value '&' with itself equals to itself, we can simplify (g&g) and (i&i) to g and i, respectively. 

We also know that any value AND False equals False, so the expression ((i&T)&(i&True)&i)&False equates to False. 

Finally, the principle of identity tells us that any value AND True equals to that value, so the expression (i&T)&(i&True) can be simplified to i. 

So far, we’ve simplified the initial logic formula to: (g|False)&T.

Now, the principle of domination tells us that any value OR False equals to that value. Therefore, the expression g|False can be simplified to g. 

Additionally, any value AND True equals to that value. Therefore, the expression g&T can be simplified to g.

So, the initial logic formula simplifies to just 'g'.",g,g

2. The logical AND with True (A&T = A). However True (T) is not present in the formula.

3. The logical NOT of False (F) is True (T): `!F = T` and vice versa (`!T = F`). Thus, `!(F&F)` and `!(F) = T`.

4. Any logical OR with True yields True: `A | T = T` so expressions `((!(F&F))&F)|T)|T`, `((!(F&F))|T)` and `(F|T)` become T.

So, Expressions (T & F), (h|F) in our formula will be F, h respectively.

2. After this step, the expression becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula can be simplified as follows:

1. F&(T&((F&T)&F)) is False because an ""and"" operation with False is always False.
2. (!(T&((z|F)|(F|T)))) is equivalent to (!T) because a ""or"" operation with False does not change the other operand, and an ""and"" operation with True does not change the other operand. So the expression becomes False because not True is False.
3. (F&((T|T)|F)) is False because an ""and"" operation with False is always False.
4. (o&((False)|False)&F) is False because an ""and"" operation with False is always False.
5. Thus, the entire expression ((F&(T&((F&T)&F)))&((o&(((!(T&((z|F)|(F|T))))|(F&((T|T)|F)))&F))&F)) simplifies to False.",F,F

((v|((v|F)|F))&((h&(((((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value ""v"" OR-ed with False (v|F) is always ""v"". So, ((v|F)|F) simplifies to v.
2. (False and False) results in False, and anything AND-ed with False also becomes False, (T&(F&F))&T equals to False.
3. Any value OR-ed with False remains the same, so, ((T&(F&F))&T)|F equals to False.
4. (f&T)&T equals to (f&T) and if we apply negation over it: (!((f&T)&T)) = !(f&T).
5. Any value OR-ed with True results in True, so (h&(((((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T equals to T.
6. Finally, substituting the above results back into the original statement,
((v|((v|F)|F))&((h&(((((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)) simplifies to (v & T) which can be shortened to ""v"".

(((w|(T&(((q|q)&q)|T)))&F)|(((!(!(((w&F)|((F&T)|(F&T)))&F)))|T)|F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. While simplifying, we must understand that any variable AND with False gives False. So (w&F) and (F&T) can be simplified to F.
   The formula then becomes (((w|(T&(((q|q)&q)|T)))&F)|((!(!((F|F)&F)))|T)|F).

2. Also note that any variable OR with False gives the variable itself. And any variable OR with the same variable itself gives the variable only. So (q|q) simplifies to q.
   The formula then simplifies to (((w|(T&((q&q)|T)))&F)|((!(!((F|F)&F)))|T)|F).

3. Also note that, something OR with True is always True, so ((q&q)|T) simplifies to T.
   The formula then simplifies to (((w|(T&T))&F)|((!(!((F|F)&F)))|T)|F).

4. Also we get that anything AND with True gives the same thing back, i.e., (T&T) = T. In addition, we already learned that anything AND with False gives us False. So ((F|F)&F) = F.
   The formula then simplifies to ((w&T)&F)|((!(F))|T)|F).

5. In Boolean logic, NOT of False is True. So the formula simplifies to ((w&T)&F)|T|F.

6. The formula can further be simplified realizing that (w&T) simplifies to w because anything AND True returns the same thing and ((w&F)|T|F) simplifies to T because anything OR with True is True.

The simplified formula is T.",T,T
96,logic,self_consistency,(((w&w)&T)&(T|((F&(!(F|(((j&F)&F)&T))))&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T))))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively.

(((w&w)&T)&(T|((F&(!(F|(((j&F)&F)&T))))&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First let's simplify: 
    - (w & w) is just w.
    - T|Any value = T (Since or with true is always true)
    - Any value&T = Any value (Since and with true remains as it is )
    - Any value|F = Any value (Since or with false remains as it is )
    - Any value&F = F (Since and with false is always false)
    - (!F) = T (Since not false is true)

2. So: 
    - (w & F & F & T) becomes (w & F), since w & F is always False.
    - (F | (j&F)) becomes F, since j & F is always F and F | F is F. 
    - T & F is False.
    - Therefore, (F & T) becomes F.

3. With these properties:
    - ((w&w)&T) becomes simply w.
    - (T | ((F & T) & (g | (a | (w | T)))) simplifies to T | ((F & g) | (a | w | T)) 
since according to the point 2 (F & T) becomes F and then it's applied the distributive property.

4. Step 3 can be simplified further to (T | (F & g)) which will be equal to T (since no matter the value of g, F & g = F and T | F = T).

5. All remaining left is ((w)&(T)) which fellow the principle ""Any value&T = Any value"" so become w.

Therefore, the fully simplified formula is w.",w,w

(((T&((((d&(T&(T&F)))|T)|T)|F))|F)|(((i&((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i))|i)|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T&F = F (Because for 'and' operator, if any of the literals is False, the result is False)
2. Thus, d&(T&(T&F)) = d&F = F.
3. Hence, (d&(T&(T&F)))|T = F|T = T (since 'or' operator requires only one true value)
4. So, (((d&(T&(T&F)))|T)|T)|F = T|F = T 
5. Now, ((T&((((d&(T&(T&F)))|T)|T)|F))|F) = (T&T)|F = T|F = T
6. Moving to the other side of the equation, ((q&T)&T)|T = (T&T)|T = T|T = T (as T&T = T and T|T = T)
7. Hence, i&((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i) = i&(i&T)&i = i&T&i = T&i = i (assuming i is either true or false, the result will be same) 
8. So the expression simplifies to ((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i)|i = i|i = i  
9. Thus, (((i&((i&(((q&T)&T)|T))&i))|i)|T)) = i|T = T (since i|T will definitely be T, no matter what value i takes)
10. So the final simplified expression is T|T = T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. l|T --> T. Because anything OR True gives True. 
2. So, (e&(l|T)) --> e&T --> e. Because anything AND True gives the value itself.
3. !(T|((b&b)|(T|F))) --> !T --> F. Because negating True gives False.
4. F&(!T) --> F. Because anything AND False gives False.
5. So, (F|(F&(!T))) --> F|F --> F. Because anything OR False gives the value itself.
6. Therefore, ((e&e) & (e&T)) --> e & e --> e. Because anything AND itself gives the value itself.
7. So, ((e&e) | (F|F)) --> e | F --> e. Because anything OR False gives the value itself.
8. The part (F&T) always gives F. Because anything AND False gives False.
9. So, (((e&e) | (F|F)) | (F&T)) --> e | F --> e. Because anything OR False gives the value itself.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, ""T & F"" gives False (F) and ""T | F"" gives True (T). 

So the equation changes to:

(((((F)&T)&F)|(T&(((F&((T)&(x&F)))|F)|(((T)&T)&T))|F)))|(T&T)

Then, ""F & T"" and ""F & x"" give False, and ""T & T"" gives True.

(((((F)&F)|(T&(((F&((T)&(F)))|F)| ((T)&T)|F))) | (T))

""Y | F"" is equivalent to Y. So in our case ""F & F"" gets us F, ""T & F"" gets us F again and ""T | F"" gets us T:

((T | (F | T)) | T)

Since ""N | T"" is always True, we can simplify the entire formula to:
