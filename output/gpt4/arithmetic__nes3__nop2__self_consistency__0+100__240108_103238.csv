A: Let's think step-by-step.","First calculate every parenthesized part:

-89-79 = -168, but modulo -100 in negative yields -68.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First find the values inside the parentheses:

- For (-53*-9), the multiplication of 53 by 9 is -477. Since this is negative, we take the modulo -100, which is -77.

- For (75+75), we have the addition of 75 and 75, which is 150. This is positive, so we take the modulo 100, which is 50.
- For (94*42), we have the multiplication of 94 by 42, which is 3948. This is positive, so we take the modulo 100, which is 48.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly handle the addition and subtraction operations inside parenthesis:
(-70+41)= -29 
(95+37)= 132
(-61+36)= -25

-29 mod 100= -29 (no changes)
132 mod 100 = 32
-25 mod -100 = -25 (no changes)
-21 mod -100 = -21 (no changes)

So our new expression to evaluate is ((-29*32)*(-25-21)).

Proceeding with multiplication:
(-29*32)= -928, 

which is less than -100, so we apply the modulo operation:
-928 mod -100= -28

Next, we compute in the second parenthesis: -65 - 62 = -127. Because -127 is negative and its absolute value is greater than 100, we should take modulo -100 of it, which is -100 + ( |-127| mod 100) = -27.

Now we proceed with the next nested parenthesis: 144 - (-27) = 171. Taking modulo 100 into account, 171 % 100 = 71.

-2 modulo -100 is -2 (same reasoning as in the first case).
-3604 modulo 100 equals 96 because -3604 = -36*100 + 96 and we take the reminder which is 96.

- (-75 -72) = -147. The modulo -100 of -147 is -47. 
- (49 + 50) = 99. The modulo 100 of 99 is 99.
- (24 * 92) = 2208. The modulo 100 of 2208 is 8.

Next, calculate the totals inside the main parentheses:
- (35 - 47) = -12. The modulo -100 of -12 is -12.
- (99 + 8) = 107. The modulo 100 of 107 is 7.

Finally, solve the expression:
- (-12 - 7) = -19. The modulo -100 of -19 is -19. 

Therefore, the answer is -19.",-19,-19
99,arithmetic,self_consistency,(((-71+-67)*(-72+-84))-((-4--63)*(-13+-19))),"Q: Solve the following arithmetic expression computing the modulo 100 of each intermediate value if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative:
(((-71+-67)*(-72+-84))-((-4--63)*(-13+-19))).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the expressions in the inner parentheses as per priority:
-71 + -67 = -138, taking modulo -100, we get -38.
-72 + -84 = -156, taking modulo -100, we get -56.
This changes our expression to
((-38)*(-56)) - next expression.

Then, -4 + -63 = -67, taking modulo -100, we get -67.
-13 + -19 = -32, taking modulo -100, we get -32.
The latter part now reads as
-((-67)*(-32)).

Now, calculate the multiplication:
-38 * -56 = 2128, taking modulo 100, we get 28.
-67 * -32 = 2144, taking modulo 100, we get 44.
Now, our expression reads as
(28) - 44.

Then, subtracting gives 28 - 44 = -16, taking modulo -100, we get -16.

Hence, the solution of the given arithmetic expression is -16.",-16,16
