""F|T"" evaluates to True because logical OR operation on False and True results in True.

""T|F"" evaluates to True again due to same reason.

""F|F"" evaluates to False because logical OR operation on two False values results in False.

So, the equation simplifies to:

((z & True) & (z & (z & T) & True)) & False

Since ""z & True"" simplifies to z (because any value AND True is the value itself), the expression simplifies further to:

(z & (z & z & True)) & False

(F&(!(((r&F)|F)&(T&(T&T))))) = (F&(!((F|F)&(T&(T&T))))).

We know that False OR False is False so we simplify further:
(F&(!((F)&(T&(T&T))))) = (F&(!(F&(T&(T&T))))).

We know that anything AND True is just the same thing. So we simplify (T&(T&T)) as just (T&T). But anything AND True is just that thing, so (T&T) is simply T:
(F&(!(F&T))) = (F&(!F)).

By De Morgan's law, the case of not False is True:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The statement ""F & F"" is always False (F), because when you have ""and"" in between, both conditions have to be True for the whole condition to be True. Since False is not True, so ""F & F"" becomes F.

The statement ""w | w"" simplifies to ""w"", because when we use ""or"" operator, if either of them is True, the result would be True. So, we don't need duplication. 

The statement ""T & (F | T)"" is True, because ""F | T"" would be True and ""T & True"" would become True.

So, the overall formula becomes:

F | (((w & w) & w) | (z | T)).

Again ""w & w"" simplifies to ""w"". So, we get:

F | ((w & w) | (z | T)),

then it further simplifies as ""w & w"" is just ""w"", so we have:

F | (w | (z | T)),

and because any value OR'ed with False is just the value, so F | X simplifies to X:

(w | (z | T)).

Final simplifying: ""z | T"" is just the value ""T"", because anything OR'ed with ""True"" is True. 

So, the simplified result is:

w | T.

(v&v)|((((b&T)|(b))&(T&F))&F)

Secondly, ""b&T"" where & is AND means we can have any value only if both are True. Else, it'll be false. Hence, ""b&T"" is simply ""b"" (T&T = T, F&T = F). So we get:

(v&v)|((((b)|(b))&(T&F))&F)

By logical AND semantics, T&F is simply false as we need both to be true. Hence, we simplify further to:

(v&v)|(((b|b)&F)&F)

Anything ORed with itself is simply the thing itself (reason being anything ORed with True is True, and anything with False is the thing itself, so both mean the same thing). Hence, ""(b|b)"" becomes ""b"" and we get:

T&T is simply T (since True AND True is always True) and 
F&T is just F (since False AND anything is always False). 

So the formula is simplified to:

Since anything OR False is the same as anything, you can simplify (l|F) to l. And c|T is T, because anything OR True is always True.

2. So the simplified formula is ((((q|(q))&(q&(q&T)))&T)&(T&False)).

((o&(((F|F)|(T&T))&(T|F)))|(!(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","We know that:
- ""F | F"" is equal to False (F). In a logical OR operation, a result is True if either or both of the operands are True. So if both are False, the result is False.
- ""T & T"" is equal to True (T). In a logical AND operation, a result is True if both operands are True. In this case, both are True so the result is True.
- ""T | F"" is equal to True (T). In a logical OR operation, a result is True if either or both of the operands are True. So if one of them is True, the result is True.
- ""!T"" is equal to False (F). In a logical NOT operation, a result is reversed. Since True is input, the result is False.
- ""!!T"" is equal to True (T). Two logical NOT operations cancel each other out. 

Given these resolves, we can substitute these values back into the formula:

""((o & ((F | (T & T)) & T)) | (!F))""

This simplifies to:

""((o & ((F | T) & T)) | T)""

""((o & (T & T)) | T)""

A: Let's think step-by-step.","At first, we can simplify (!(!F)) to T, as the not operator flips the existing value of F (False) to True and then again, due to another !, flips True back to True.

So now, the formula becomes:
(((x|x)&(s|T))|T).

If you OR anything with True, the result is True, so simplify (s|T) to T. ORing anything with itself results in the same thing, so x|x becomes x:

((x&T)|T).

Doing an AND operation with True doesn't change the value, so x AND T simplifies to x:

The term (F or False) simplifies to False itself. Thus, the formula now becomes:

!((T&F)&(!(T&True))).

Again, ""And"" operation between True and False gives False. Also, And operation between True and True gives True. So, the formula becomes:

!(False&(!True)).

Negation of True gives False, which makes the formula now:

!(False&False).

""And"" operation between False and False gives False. So the equation simplifies further to:

!False.

Finally, negation of False gives True. Therefore, the simplified version of the original logical formula is:

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify each part independently. 

The operation (T|(F&F)) simplifies to T - since we are taking an OR operation with True

So, the first part now becomes (l&T) which simplifies to l since T is the neutral element for AND operation

The second part (F&(!((d&F)&F))) simplifies to F - since we are taking AND operation with False, noting that !(any value) would just negate that value.

The entire expression now is ((l|l)|F), which simplifies to (l|F), since l OR with itself is just l. In the end, since F is the neutral element for OR operation, the entire expression simplifies to :

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: Simplify (T&(T&(o&(T&F)))) and ((T&(F&F))|F)

In Boolean logic, True AND anything = anything, and False AND anything = False.

So, (T&(T&(o&(T&F)))) = (T&(T&(o&F))) = (T&(T&F)) = (T&F) = F

And, ((T&(F&F))|F) = ((T&F)|F) = (F|F) = F

Step 2: Simplify ((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F)))

Now the formula becomes (F|k&F) = (F|F) = F

So, the simplified formula is F.",F,F

Second, F&((a&F)&F) simplifies to F and ((F|h)&T) simplifies to F.
Third, f|F will be simplified to f, because any statement or False is that statement.
Finally, the original statement ((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))) will become (f|f), which simplifies to f.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly: 
- Since F or F is always False, the original formula becomes: (F | (((!T) & F) | T) | (T & F)).
- Not T is always False, because T is always True. Consequently, we can simplify to: (F | ((F & F) | T) | (T & F)).
- The AND operation with F as one operand (F & X) always results in F. Therefore, we have: (F | (F | T) | F).
- As we established before, F or F is always False. Applying this rule the formula becomes: (F | (F | T)).
- Applying the principle of associativity (which says that X | (Y | Z) == (X | Y) | Z), we can simplify it further to: ((F | F) | T).
- As the result of the above simplification, F or F is always False so the formula is now: (F | T).
- Finally, F or T always results in T.

Therefore, the simplified form of the given logical formula is T.",T,T
