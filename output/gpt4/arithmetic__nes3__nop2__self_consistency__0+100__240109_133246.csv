A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, compute the expression in the first set of parentheses (53+91). The result is 144. Since it's more than 100, take the modulo: 144 mod 100 = 44.

Then compute all expressions in the third set of parentheses: (-89-79) = -168, and (17+69) = 86. Since -168 is negative, we take the modulo -100: -168 mod -100 = -68. Then subtract 86 from -68: -68 - 86 = -154. Since -154 is negative, we take the modulo -100: -154 mod -100 = -54.

Now, compute the subtraction of the values found, taking the modulo if needed. The first operation to do is 44 - (-87) = 44 + 87 = 131. Since it's more than 100, we take the modulo: 131 mod 100 = 31.

-1488 mod -100 = -88

-34 - 68 = -102

9 - 88 = -79

-102 mod -100 = -2 

-79 mod 100 = -79

Insert these results back into the equation:

(-2 + -79).

For -51, it also remains -51 since it is within the range of -100 and 100.

For -51, it remains -51 since it is within the range of -100 and 100.
For -48, it remains -48 since it is within the range of -100 and 100.

Taking the modulo -100 of -91 gives us -91, as it is within the range between -100 and 100. 
Taking the modulo -100 of -3 gives us -3, also within the range.

((-70)+(-1))*((-79)+(5))

We then carry on with the operations:

-70-1 = -71. This is negative, so we compute modulo -100, which is -71.

-79+5 = -74. Again, negative, so we compute modulo -100, which is -74.

Substitute these values back:
(-71)*(-74)

Product of two negatives is a positive value:
-71*-74 = 5254. As it's positive, we compute modulo 100, which gives us 54.

So, the answer is 54.",54,54

(((-29+64)+(-75-72))-((49+50)+(24*92))).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we start with the innermost parentheses:

-29 + 64 = 35
-75-72 = -147. We must find the remainder after dividing by -100, so we get -47.

Next, we simplify these intermediate results:
35 - (-47) = 35 + 47 = 82

Then, dealing with the right side of the expression:

49 + 50 = 99
24 * 92 is 2208, taking modulo 100 we get 8.

Finally, 99 + 8 = 107. After applying the modulo 100 operator, we get 7.

Now, we have to finalize our main expression:

82 - 7 = 75. The result is 75.",75,-19

(((-71+-67)*(-72+-84))-((-4--63)*(-13+-19))).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the sums inside the brackets:
- -71 + -67 = -138 
- -72 + -84 = -156 
- -4 + -63 = -67 
- -13 + -19 = -32  

An important fact to remember while dealing with modulo is, we perform modulo operation after all sums, subtractions, and multiplicative operations.

So:

- -138 modulo -100 = -38
- -156 modulo -100 = -56
- -67 modulo -100 = -67
- -32 modulo -100 = -32

Now, let's calculate the multiplications:
- -38 * -56 = 2128
- -67 * -32 = 2144

Calculating the modulo 100 of each number:

- 2128 modulo 100 = 28
- 2144 modulo 100 = 44

Finally, subtract the second number from the first one:
- 28 - 44 = -16

The modulo -100 for -16 is -16. Therefore, the answer to the expression is -16.",-16,16
