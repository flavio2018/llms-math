A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. ((T & T) | T) will always be true, so the expression simplifies to ((m&((T&!(T&F))&T)&((m|(T&F))&T))|(m|m)) where the symbol ! denotes 'not', & denotes 'and', and | denotes 'or'.
2. (T & !T) equals to false, regardless of any other operation, so the expression simplifies further to ((m&((T&F)&T)&((m&F)&T))|(m|m)).
3. (T & F) is always false, so the expression simplifies to ((m&F&F)|(m|m)).
4. (m & F) is always false, so the expression simplifies to (F | (m|m)).
5. (m | m) is equivalent to m, so the expression simplifies to F | m.
6. (F | value) always equals to the value, so the expression simplifies to just m.

On the second half of your expression:
1. ((i | F) & F) simplifies to F (because anything OR False equals the variable, and any variable AND False equals False).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, you should remember about following logic shortcuts:
1. (F | x) = x, because False OR x gives us x.
2. (T & x) = x, because True AND x gives us x.
3. (x & x) = x, because x AND x is just x.
4. (x | x) = x, because x OR x is just x.
5. (F & x) = F, because False and x always gives False.
6. (!F) = T, because not False is True.
7. (!T) = F, because not True is False.
8. (T | x) = T, because True or x always gives True.
9. ((F | T) = T) & ((F & T) = F) because True or False is True, and False and True is False.

Now we can simplify the given formula step-by-step using these rules:

!(F|!F) simplifies to !T = F.
Next,
!(T&T) and (T|T) simplifies to T.
Next, 
(F | T) simplifies to T, 
(F & T) simplifies to F,
then
(F | T) and (F & T) simplifies to T and F which is F.
Next, the deepest (F | T) is F or T, which is T.
Next, 
(w|T) simplifies to T, so following bracket (((F|T)&(w|T)) simplifies just to T.
Further,
(j&T) simplifies to j, so following ((((j&(((F|T)&(w|T))))&j) simplifies to j, and ((((j&(((F|T)&(w|T))))&j)|j) to j too.

2. The expressions F&j and F&F are always False, hence simplify to F. To further simplify, keep in mind that k|F is the same as k and F|T is T. So the formula now simplifies to:
   !((k|((k&k)&(((t&F)&t&T)|T)))|T).
   
3. The expressions t&F and k&k are always False and k, respectively. So the formula simplifies to:

4. Since anything AND False is False, the formula further simplifies to:

2. Similarly, we can simplify any AND operation with False to False because False AND anything is False. Hence, T&(F&T) becomes F.
3. Also, anything OR False is the same as just the original thing. Hence (c|(!(T&(F&T)))|F) can be simplified to (c|(!F)), turning into (c|T), which yields T.
4. Now, in the term (!(F|(j&(((!(F|F))|F)&(!((!F)|T)))))), False OR False is False, so (!(F|F)) is equal to !F (not False), which means True. And False AND True is False, so (j&(((!(F|F))|F)&(!((!F)|T)))) is False. Hence, this can all be simplified to False.
4. False OR any other formula can be reduced to that formula, so (F|False) equals False.
5. Anything AND True is equal to the original, so T & ((c|(!F))|False) can be reduced to T & T equals T.

Third, note that for any value v, v&F = F and v|F = v because AND'ing any value with False gives False, and OR'ing any value with False returns the original value.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the constants T and F to their true meaning. Since (T|F) equals to True because T stands for True, likewise (F|T) equals to T. And (T&F) and (F&F) equal to F.

Now the given expression looks like:
(!(((!(!(o|T)))|F)|(q|((T&(z|T))|T))))

Then, we can simplify (o|T) to T, same thing with (z|T),and (r|T), all will equal to True because the operation is logical OR and it's enough for one of them to be True, to make the whole operation True. 

After making these modifications, the expression becomes:

Now, let's simplify (!T) which equals to False and (T&T) equals to True, the expression now is:

(!(T|F)|(q|T))

This simplifies further to:

2. (F&F), (F|F), ((n|F)&F), ((T|(!T))) results in F because 'F&F' is False, 'F|F' is False, '(n|F)&F' becomes 'n&F' which is False, 'T|(!T)' since the opposite value of 'T' is 'F', 'T|F' results in T i.e., True.

Now the formula becomes:

((((u|((F)&((F&T)&((T|F) | F))) | F)) | F) | u) | (T&(!(!d&F)))) 

3. In the formula, (F&T), (T|F) these two expressions evaluating to F and T respectively because 'F&T' is False, 'T|F' is True.
 
Now replace the values, it becomes:

((((u|((F)&(F&((T) | F))) | F)) | F) | u) | (T&(!(!d&F)))) .

4. ((F)&(F&((T) | F))) this whole expression reduces to F because 'F&F' is False. 

Here is the formula now:

(((((u|F)|F)|F) | u) | (T&(!(!d&F)))) .

5. (u|F) results in u because 'x | F' results in 'x' i.e., u.
6. In the formula, you can observe u OR'ed to a value and again the result OR'ed to u. So the result will be u only because u|u results in u.

So the formula becomes:

(u | (T&(!(!d&F)))) .

7. 'T & x' is x, and again !(!d&F) is (d | T), which just results in T, because 'T | x' is always T.

 3. Then we consider !(T|F) since we already established that T|F is T, !(T|F) is !T, i.e. F.

 6. (z&(!((((!F)|((z|T)|(((T|F)&F)|(!(T|F)))))&(T&F))|F)) simplifies to z&(T|F) which gives us z&T = z.

(T&T) will give you T, and (!((T&T)|F)) will give you F because T or F will be T, the negation of which is F.

Now, to analyze this part - a&(((!(!(F|(T|T))))&(T|(!((T&T)|F))))|T), since the second part simplifies as outlined above to T & T | T, which is simply T, this whole expression turns to a&T which turns out to be 'a' only as any statement & T will be itself only.

On the other hand, because && and || are associative and idempotent, (y&y)&y can be simplified to y, and c&(c&(c&T)) can be simplified to c. 

Additionally, we know that ""any logical AND operation with F (False) results in F"". Therefore using this principle, (w&F)&F simplifies to F.

Also, !F (not False) is always true, hence (d&d)|(!F) simplifies to T.

Let's substitute all these simplifications back to the original formula:
((c|(!T))|(T&(((y&y)&y)|(y|((c&(c&(c&T)))|((T|(((w&F)&F)|(T&((d&d)|(!F)))))&T)))))

So formula becomes ((k&F)|F|((q&F)&(!F)&((u&F)&(T|(!F)|((s&T)|((s|F)&(s&T)))|(T|T))))).

3. Looking at the bracket which contains (T|(!F)|((s&T)|((s|F)&(s&T)))|(T|T))), we can simplify it:
   
   The expression (X|F) where X is anything is always equal to X. So, (s|F) can be simplified to s.
   
   Then we have (T|(!F)) , this will result to T because !F is T and T or Anything results to T.

2. Also, anything OR-ed with True (|T) will be True. Meaning that (s|(f|T)) would give us True, so (!((T&True)&F)) will give us False. 
    
    Now the expression will look like: ((T&False)| (!(!((d|False)& False &T)))). 

3. Anything AND-ed with False (&F) is False, on applying below: 

    (d | False) results in just d since an OR operation with a False results in the other operand: (d & False & T). Then the entire expression becomes False because of the AND with False, hence, this will give us ((T&False)| (!(!False))).

4. Calculating the value inside the most nested (!) symbol starts with (!False) which will give True, so the whole expression would then be like this: ((T&False)| (!True)).

5. This can further be simplified to False OR False, which finally gives us False.

1. !!T is T, F|T is T, (for any literal a a|T is also T), (i|T is T), so we could substitute all T to True throughout the equation.

As for (((d&(((d|F)&(d|d))|F))&d)|T), this simplifies to T, since something or True equals to True.

10. From step 8 and 9, you get T & F which simplifies to F (as explained in step 3).

2. Also, any statement ""F & A"" is always False, so (F & F) simplifies to F, and the expression becomes: ((t & F | T) & (w & !(T & ((t & T) | T))) & F) | !T.

3. The logical not of True, !T, is False. So, this expression simplifies to: ((t & F | T) & (w & !(T & ((t & T) | T))) & F) | F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Remember that:

- variable OR variable is always the variable (o|o -> o )
- FALSE OR variable is always the variable (F|o -> o)
- TRUE OR variable is always TRUE (T|o -> T)
- variable AND variable is always the variable (o&o -> o)
- FALSE AND variable is always FALSE (F&o -> F)
- TRUE AND variable is always the variable (T&o -> o)

Use these rules, we can simplify the expression starting from the innermost parentheses:

- !(T&T) becomes !T since T and T is just T, but F, because ! swaps the boolean values
- ((T&(!T)) simplifies to F, because true and false is false
- Then, (x|F) simplifies to x, because false OR x is just x
- And, (x&x) simplifies to x again 

Now the inner parentheses (((x|F)&T)|((x&x)&x)) mostly simplifies to x since ((x&x)&x) equals x and ((x|F)&T) is x as T does not affect the value in an AND operation while F does not change the value in OR operation. 

Moving a step outward, &F for any value results in F (x&F -> F).

Considering this, the whole right part (F|(((T&(!T))&T)|(F|((((x|F)&T)|((x&x)&x))&F)))) simplifies to F since at the end we have an AND operation with False.

The left part o|(o|o) simplifies to o, because any variable OR the same variable gives the same variable.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, start by simplifying the operations which include True (T) or False (F) since these have known values. 

We know that:
1) F|F...|X gives us X, because 'or' with False does not change the original value. 
2) T|T...|X gives us True no matter what is X, because 'or' with True will always be True.  
3) F&(F...&X) gives us False no matter what is X, because 'and' with False will always yield False. 
4) T&(T...&X) gives us X, because 'and' with True does not change the original value.

Given the first logical formula
(!((F|(T|(F|(T&(l&F)))))

We can simplify this formula as follows:

T&(l&F) => F (because 'and' with False yields False) 
Then we substitute F into the original formula: 

(F|(T|(F|(F)))) 
=> (F|(T|(F|F)))
=> (F|(T|F)) 
=> (F|T) => T

However, this is the opposite (!T), so the logic formula yields False (F). 

Now let's look at the second logical formula

(!(((!((T&(!(T&(i&F))))|((T|(F|(m&F)))|F)))&T)|F))).

Similar with the first one, we can simplify this formula as follows:

T&(i&F) => F
Then we substitute F into the original formula: 

(!((T&(!F))|(((T|(F|m&F)))|F))&T 

=> (!((T&T)|((T|F|F))|F))&T 
=> (!((T)|T|F))&T 
=> (!T)&T

3. In the given logic formula, !(f&(f&f)) = !(F) = T, because we negate the 'False' part.

(!T) simplifies to F
(T | F) simplifies to T
(F | F) simplifies to F
(T & T) simplifies to T
(!F) simplifies to T

2) (!(((n|n)|((F|((((z|z)|F)&(((F&T)|(!T))|T))|T))&(T|((!T)&F))))) simplifies to (!((n|(F|((z|F)&(F|T))&T)))

((w&(w&(w|F)))&((m&((d|(F&F)&F))|T)).

!T means not True which is False (F), so wherever we see !T we can replace it by F.

Next, consider (((f&(f|(!T)))&T)&T)&f). Since !T is always false, (f|(!T)) becomes (f|F), which simplifies to f. Also, considering f & f, it is simply f. Moreover, f & T is f (since anything and true is always the thing itself) and so is f & f which makes it f.

Similarly, consider the part (f|(((f|F)&T)|F)). Since (f|F) is always true, this simplifies to ((T&T)|F), i.e. (T|F), which is always true.

2. By DeMorgans law, `!((a & b))` is equal to `(!a | !b)`. Applying this rule and the rule above, we can simplify it as follows:

4. `T & ((_expression_))` is equivalent to `(_expression_)`, because true and anything is equivalent to that anything. Therefore, `(T & (F & ((_expression_))))` becomes `(F & ((_expression_)))` which in turn becomes `F`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The basic principle for simplifying such expressions is to use the Laws of Boolean Algebra. Here we use three main laws:

2) $A ∨ F = A $, which means $A$ OR FALSE is equivalent to $A$, and 
3) $A ∨ TRUE = TRUE$ , which means $A$ OR TRUE is equivalent to TRUE.

$(((((f|f)|((f|F)&((T&((F|((!F)|F))|T))&(((a&(!(F|F)))|a)|T))))|f)|T)|(((n&T)&F)|T))$

First, simplify $f|f$ to $f$ using rule 1).

Next, simplify $f|F$ to $f$ using rule 2).

Also, simplify $F|((!F)|F))$ to $T$ because $!F$ is $T$ and $T|F$ equals to $T$.

After that, simplify $a&(!(F|F))$ to $a$ because $!F$ is $T$ and $a&T$ equal to $a$.

Similarly apply rule 1), replace $a|a$ by $a$.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we remove F&F at (((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|(F&F))|o), since False AND anything is False, this reduces to (((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|F)|o).
2. On further simplifying, ((o|(o|F))&(((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|F)|o)) reduces to ((o|(o))&(((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|F)|o)), which can be simplified to (o&(((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|F)|o)). Because o OR False is always equal to o, (o|F) changes to o.
3. Now, we have (((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|F)|o), look at ((o&T)|F), it can be simplified to o&T. So we have ((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|o), it simplifies to (((o&T)&o)|(o&T)|o)).

5. Now, at starting (o&((o&T)|o)), ((o&T)|o) is always ‘or’ with 'o’, so ((o&T)|o) can be simplified 'o'. Hence the expression becomes (o&o), which is nothing but 'o'.
6. Hence !((((o&T)|(((o|(o|F))&(((((o&T)&o)|((o&T)|F))|(F&F))|o))&(!F)))|T)|(F&(z&F))) simplifies to !((o&T)|T), which is always OR with True. Hence (!((o&T)|T)) simplifies to F.

(((s&((s&(((s&T)&(s&k)))|s))&T)|c&F).
4. c&F = F (since false and any value is F), after substitute we get:
(((s&((s&(((s&T)&(s&k)))|s))&T)|F).

(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F) = F|F = F
(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T) = F|T = T

Therefore, the entire formula simplifies to j&T = j if j = T and F if j = F.",j,j

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, '!T' results in 'F' and '!(!T)' results in 'T'. 'T|T', 'T|F', 'F|T' and 'T' all result in 'True'. So, let's use these rules to simplify our long formula:

=s & (T|F) & s | s | s & (o & T & (h | T | F | F & T) & F & T)

=s & T & s | s | s & (o & T & T & F & T)

We know that 'True or False' is 'True' and 'True and False' is 'False'. So:

=s & T & s | s | s & F

=s & s | s | 0

=s | s | 0

Next, apply the rule, 'False or X' results in X. Therefore, the simplified version of your formula is:

=s | s

Hence, it simplifies down to:

=s.",s,s
