0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical ""or"" operation (|) produces True if either one or both of the operands are True. Therefore, as we have (h|T), it does not matter what value ""h"" holds. Even if h is False, because we have an ""or"" operation with True, the result will always be True. So (h|T) simplifies to T.",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical ""or"" ( | ) returns True if at least one of the arguments is True. Therefore, False or True (F | T) is True (T).",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula is (v&T). This means it is ""v and True"". The AND operation will only be True if both operand are True. 

So, in this case, if v is True, then the result will be True (since True & True = True), and if v is False, the result will be False (since False & True = False). 

Therefore, the simplified logic formula is just ""v"".",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (o|F) means o OR False. According to the rules of logical operations, if one operand in the OR operation is False, the result of the operation will be the value of the other operand. So, the simplified form of this expression will be 'o'.",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The statement is (q|F), which means ""q OR False"". The OR operator gives a True result if either or both of its operands are True. But here one of the operands is False (F), it cannot make the result true. So, the value of the whole OR operation is decided by 'q' alone. Therefore, this formula simplifies to 'q'.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical formula (f&F) is equivalent to False. 

Explanation:
In a logical and operation, the result is true if and only if both operands are true. Hence, anything AND false is always false, regardless of the value of f.",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula is (w&w), which means ""w and w"". In logical terms, something and itself will always just be itself. Therefore, the simplified form is simply ""w"".",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to know that the logical operator | (logical or) is defined as follows: it is True when at least one of the operands is True. When one operand is False, the result is equal to the other operand.

So consider the statement (b | F), as F is False irrespective of the value of 'b', the statement will hold the value of 'b'.

Simplified logic formula is just 'b'.",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical formula (o|o) represents a logic OR operation. This operation returns true if at least one of its operands (in this case, ""o"" or ""o"") are true. Since the operands are identical, the operation essentially checks if ""o"" is true. If ""o"" is true, then the operation would return true, and if ""o"" is false, then it would return false.

So, the simplification of (o|o) would be just ""o"".",o,o
