2. Now, repeated applications of the identity law simplify the expression further.

(!(((F|(F&(T|T)))&(F&((e|F)|T)))&(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Let's start from the innermost operations:

""F|(F&(T|T))""
The operation ""T|T"" returns T (true). As result, ""F&(T)"" returns F (False) because the logical ‘AND’ operation returns true if and only if both of its operands are True, otherwise it returns False.
So, the operation ""F|F"" also returns F (false), resulting in F.

Now we substitute F back into the next inner brackets:
""F&((e|F)|T)""
The operation ""e|F"" could be either True or False depending on what value e possesses. However, the operation ""(True or False)|T"" is always True, because if either of the operands for the logical “OR” operation is True, the result is True.
Hence this statement ""F&True"" results in F (False) because the logical ‘AND’ operation returns true if and only if both of its operands are True, otherwise it returns False.

So far we have simplified the formula to:
""!(F&F&!T)""

The binary logical operation AND ""F&F"" also returns F (False).

Thus, the formula becomes ""!(F&!T)"".

As before, the new AND operation ""F&!T"" results in F (False), because the logical ‘AND’ operation returns true if and only if both of its operands are True, otherwise it returns False. Here, as ""F"" is False and ""!T"" is False, the operation returns False.

Finally, the formula becomes ""!F"".

As ""F"" is False, ""!"" transforms it into True.

- (F|F) is equivalent to F

1) X & T = X (Any value AND True is equal to that initial value)
2) X | T = T (Any value OR True is always True)
3) X & F = F (Any value AND False is always False)
4) X | F = X (Any value OR False is equal to the initial value)
5) !T = F (Not True is False)
6) !F = T (Not False is True)
7) X & X = X (Any value AND the same value is equal to the initial value)
8) X | X = X (Any value OR the same value is equal to the initial value)

Now let's apply these principles to the given formula:

Step 1: (((((n&T)&T)&n)|n)|(((n|(o&F))|F)|F)))
- Here we have used principle 1 and 5 on the sub-formula (n&T), (n&(n&T)) and (o&(!T)) and replaced them by n, n and o&F respectively.

Step 2: (((n&n)|n)|((n|(o&F))|F))
- Here we have used principle 1 on the sub-formula (n&T) and replaced it by n.

Step 3: ((n|n)|(n|(o&F)))
- Here we have used principle 7 on the sub-formula (n&n) and replaced it by n.

Step 4: (n|(n|(o&F)))
- Here we have used principle 8 on the sub-formula (n|n) and replaced it by n.

Step 5: (n|o)
- Here we have used principle 3 and 4 on sub-formula (n|(o&F)) and replaced it by n|o.

- T|F = T (if one argument in logical or operation is T, it's T).

Step 1: Break down the expression into simpler forms.

We can simplify the statement based on laws of logic like Identity law, Domination law, Idempotent law, Double negation law, Commutative law, Associative law, Distributive law, De Morgan's law, Absorption law, Negation law, etc.

Step 2: Simplify nested expressions

Looking at the input, we can simplify nested expressions. 

Firstly (s&s)|(s&s) simplifies to (s|s) = s based on the Absorption law: p & (p|q) is equivalent to p, and p | (p&q) is the same as p. 

Secondly (((s|s)|s)|T) simplifies to (s|T) = T based on number of things:

- The Associative law: ((p|q)|r) is equivalent to (p|(q|r)), and ((p&q)&r) is the same as (p&(q&r)). It implies that the parentheses in the nested structures can be moved around without changing the logic. Here, (((s|s)|s)|T) has the same meaning as (s|s|s|T) using this law.
- The Domination law: For any proposition p, (p | T) is equivalent to T, and (p & F) is the same as F. T (true) dominates OR, and F (false) dominates AND.
    
So, ((s&((((s&s)|(s&s))|s)|T)) becomes (s&T)= s again based on the Domination law.

Step 3: Simplify the next part of the expression

(((T|T)|T) simplifies to T based on the Idempotent law: p or p gives p, p and p gives p. 

Hence ((s&T)|F) simplifies to (s|F)= s based on the Identity law: p or False is p, p and True is p.

Step 4: Combine two parts

So, the whole expression simplifies as (s&s)=s. The whole expression simplifies to s based on the Absorption law: p & (p|q) is equivalent to p.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (F&T) automatically evaluates to F (False) because both values in an 'and' operation (&) need to be true for the operation to yield True.
So, we can replace (F&T) in ((!(!((F&T)&(F&F))))|F)|(!(T&(g&(i&F)))) with F:

((!(!(F&(F&F))))|F)|(!(T&(g&(i&F))))

Again, the expression (F&F) also evaluates to F, hence we get:

((!(!(F&F)))|F)|(!(T&(g&(i&F))))

Simplify it further to:

((!(!F))|F)|(!(T&(g&F)))

Now, (!F) evaluates to T (True), because !F is the negation of False, which is True:

((!T)|F)|(!(T&(g&F)))

Again, the negation of True is False, so we have:

(F|F)|(!(T&(g&F)))

The expression (F|F) evaluates to F (False) because a single True in an 'or' operation (|) would yield True, but we have two Falses:

F|(!(T&(g&F)))

Next, the expression (g&F) evaluates to F, because both values need to be true for an 'and' operation (&) to yield True:

F|(!(T&F))

Then (T&F) evaluates to F, so we get:

F|(!F)

Finally, the negation of False (!F) is True (T), so the given logic formula simplifies to:

3. The AND operation is associative. That means the group of literals doesn't matter (i & i & i is just i). So, (i&i&i) can be rewritten as i.

(!(!(!F))) is F (as we're only changing the truth value 3 times).

4. Let's focus on T&T, which will result to True.
5. The expression (True&True)∨F results to True.
6. Then we have F&True which results to False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic constants ""T"" and ""F"" act as identity elements in boolean logic. That is, for any boolean value A:

- A | T == T (because A OR true is always true)
- A & T == A (because A AND true is always A)  
- A | F == A (because A OR false is always A)
- A & F == F (because A AND false is always false)

It is also to note that not of any true is false and not of any false is true. Hence, !(T&F) becomes not of (true and false), i.e not of false which is equal to true. Hence, !(T&F) = T

Now, let's simplify the given expression step by step:

- Step 1: Simplifying T | T & T. According to operation precedence, ""and"" (&) is performed before ""or"" (|). But both sides of & operator are T. Hence, the expression simplifies to T.
- Step 2: Replacing !(T&F) = T, the equation reduces to ((T|T)&((T&T|F))|(T|((t&F)&T)) = T.
- Step 3: F & T == F. Replacing F & T with F, the equation simplifies to ((T|T)&(T|F))|(T|(t&F)) = T.
- Step 4: Substituting T for A & T (since A & T == A), and T for A | T (since A | T == T), the equation is now T = T.
