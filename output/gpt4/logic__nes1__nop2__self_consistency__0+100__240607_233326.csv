0,logic,self_consistency,(h|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(h|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula (h|T) simplifies to T. Regardless of the value of h, using logical OR (|) with T (True) will always return True.",T,T
1,logic,self_consistency,(F|T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(F|T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula means 'False OR True', in which if either side are True, the whole expression will be True. Since we have True on one side, the simplified equation is T (or True).",T,T
2,logic,self_consistency,(v&T),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(v&T).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula ""(v&T)"" states that ""v"" and ""True"" must both be true. Given that ""&"" (and) operator only returns true if both of its operands are true, the formula simplifies to just ""v"" because it's the only operand whose value can change. Therefore, if ""v"" is true, then the whole equation is true. But if ""v"" is false, then the whole equation is false. So the simplified form of the formula is ""v"".",v,v
3,logic,self_consistency,(o|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical ""or"" operator (|) returns True if either or both of its operands are True. Since F is False, the only factor that matters here for the final result is the o. So, the simplification of the equation is just ""o"".",o,o
4,logic,self_consistency,(q|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(q|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical or operator, |, returns True if at least one of its operands is True. 

Thus if you have q or False, this is the same as just q, because False will not affect the final output of the or operation. 

Therefore, the simplified form of the logic formula (q|F) is just q.",q,q
5,logic,self_consistency,(f&F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(f&F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The symbol & represents logical and operation. According to the truth table of logical and operation, the result is true only when both operands are true. Here, f is an operand and can be either True or False. The second operand is F which is False. Hence the result of (f&F) is False regardless of the value of f. So, the simplified logic formula is F.",F,F
6,logic,self_consistency,(w&w),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(w&w).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The ""and"" condition (represented by &) is true if both conditions it involves are true. So for the condition (w&w), both elements are just 'w'. Therefore, the simplified logic formula is 'w'.",w,w
7,logic,self_consistency,(b|F),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(b|F).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula asks if either 'b' is true or False is true. 

Since we know that False is never true, we can say that the answer depends on 'b'. 

If 'b' is true, then the whole statement is true. If 'b' is false, then the whole statement is false. 

So this statement simplifies to just (b).",b,b
8,logic,self_consistency,(o|o),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(o|o).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical OR operation with two identical inputs acts like an identity. Meaning, if you take the OR of a value and itself, you will always get the original value back. In the case of o|o, the simplified formula would be just o, no matter if o is True or False.",o,o
