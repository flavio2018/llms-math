3. Looking at the expression (h&(((r&F)|F)|(x&(b&F)))), we have simplified (r&F) to F, (x&(b&F)) to F, applying this simplification the original expression becomes (h&((F|F)|F)); which simplifies to (h&F) and ultimately to F since anything ANDed with False gives F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the innermost logic expressions:

(!T) simplifies to F, because the negation of True is False.
(F&(!((!T)&T))) simplifies to F&(!F) because !T=T is F and (F&T) is F. The overall expression then became F&(!F), which can be further simplified to F&True -- and this simplifies finally to F because anything ANDed with False is False.
(F&T) and (T&T) simplifies to F and T respectively because anything ANDed with False is False and anything ANDed with True is the same value, respectively. So, ((F&T)|(T&T)) simplifies to F|T = T.
Now T&(((F&T)|(T&T))&F) simplifies to T&T&F which simplifies to F.
Next, e|((z|(T&(((F&T)|(T&T))&F)))|T) simplifies to e|(z|F|T) because T&(((F&T)|(T&T))&F)=F. And further simplifies to e|(z|T) as anything ORed with False is that value, then that simplifies to e|T. Since anything ORed with True is True, it simplifies to T.

With all those simplifications, our original expression simplifies to ((F)|((!(F))|(T))). Now, this can be simplified further:

!(F) simplifies to T, because the negation of False is True.

So, our expression becomes (F)|(T)|T which further simplifies to T|T|T. Since anything ORed with True is True, the final answer is T.",T,T

((((((F&(T|(F&(T|F))))|((T|(!(!T)))|F))|F)&F)|T)|(T|(F&(!(!F)))))

So the expression becomes:
((((((F&(T|(F&(T|F))))|((T|(T))|F))|F)&F)|T)|(T|(F&F))))

Second, compute the logical or (T|T) and logical and (F&F) which become T and F respectively. 

This gives:
((((((F&(T|(F&(T|F))))|(T|F))|F)&F)|T)|(T|F)))

Next, compute the logical OR operations involving T, because T OR anything is always T:
((((((F&T)|(T))|F)&F)|T)|(T|F)) => (((T|F)&F)|T)|(T|F) => (T&F)|T|T|F => F|T|T|F

Next, reduce the expression involving logical OR and logical AND with F and T:

Therefore, ""((k&(((k&T)|k)&((F|T)|T)))|T)"" simplifies to ""T|T"", and further to ""T"".

So, ""(!((F&(F|(!F)))|((k&(((k&T)|k)&((F|T)|T)))|T)))"" simplifies to ""!(F|T)"", and further simplifies to ""!T"", which further simplifies to ""F"" because the negation of a true statement results in a false statement.

1. !F equals to T and !T equals to F.
2. X & X equals to X and X | X equals to X where X is any valid logical statement.

4. F&X equals to F and X&F equals to F where X is any valid logical statement.

6. F|X equals to X and X|F equals to X where X is the valid logical statement.
7. X&(!X) equals to F, X|(!X) equals to T, where X is any valid logical statement.

Now start simplifying the original formula:

    !(F|((!(F&(((j&j)|j)&F)))|(v|((!(!F))&F)|T)))

we know that:

   let X = j, so (j&j)|j = X|X = X
   F&X = F

   X|((!(!F))&F) = j | (T & F) = j | F = j
   v|j|T = T

from this direct simplification should be:

- !F = T

Now let's substitute constants:

((q | q) & (((T | T) | !((h | F | F) | T)) | ((T & !(T | !T)) & F)) & (F | F))

((q | q) & ((T | !(h | F | T)) | (F & F)) & F)

Furthermore, 

- q | q = q (the same elements always give the same element)

Substituting:

(q & ((T | !h) | F) & F)

- T | F = T
- T | !h = T (since operation with True always gives True)

Substituting:

(q & T & F)

And finally:

- q & T = q
- q & F = F

As per the law of Boolean algebra, the result of logical OR between any expression and False is the same expression:

F | F = F

F | T = T

The given equation after making the above substitutions would be:

((z | (z & z)) & ((((v | (v & T)) & T) | F) & (T | (F & (f & T)))) | F) | T)

Further simplifying:

As per the law of Boolean algebra, the result of logical AND between any expression and True is the same expression:

v & T = v
v & T = v

Substitution in the equation gives:

((z | (z & z)) & ((((v | v)) & T) | F) & (T | (F & (f & T)))) | F) | T)

And again after applying the law of Boolean algebra, the result of logical OR between same expression would be the expression itself:

v | v = v

After substitution in the equation we get:

((z | (z & z)) & ((v & T) | F) & (T | (F & (f & T)))) | F) | T)

Applying the logical AND between same expression rule to ""z & z"":

z & z = z

After substitution in the equation we get:

((z | z) & ((v & T) | F) & (T | (F & (f & T)))) | F) | T)

Applying the same rule to ""z | z"":

z | z = z

After substitution in the equation we get:

(z & ((v & T) | F) & (T | (F & (f & T)))) | F) | T)

Further transformation:

Logical OR between any value and False gives the value itself. 
Logical AND between any value and True gives the value itself. 

Simplifying (v & T) | F gives:

(v & T) | F = v | F = v

And (F & (f & T)) gives: 

F & (f & T) = F 

Transferring this to the equation, the value of ""T | F & (f & T)"" is ""T | F"" which simplifies to ""T"". Replacing, we get:

Z & v & T | T = T

Step 2: 
Any value OR False is always the value itself, while any value AND False is always False.
So, (F|F|F) => F and (F&F) => F. So, we substitute these values.
Expression becomes: ((x|!F)&F)

Step 3: 
The negation of False is True so !F => T.
Expression becomes: ((x|T)&F)

Step 4: 
Again, any value OR True is always True.
So (x|T) => T
Expression becomes: (T&F)

Step 5: 
As said before, any value AND False is always False.
So (T&F) => F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, notice that anything AND-ed with False (`F`) is `F`, anything AND-ed with True (`T`) remains the same, and anything OR-ed with False (`F`) remains the same, and anything OR-ed with True(`T`) is `T`.

In `T&(e&F)`, `e&F` is always `F`, so the term becomes `T&F`, which is `F`.
Therefore, `(p|(p&p))&(T&(e&F)) = p&F = F`, 
So we can write `(((((p|(p&p))&(T&(e&F)))|F)|F)`, as `F|F` or just `F`.

In `(F|(!(!F))) = F|T = T`,

(T&(F|(T&F))) simplifies to T&(F|F), and further simplifies to T&F, and this simplifies to F.

2. Moving on to (T&((F)&F)), this simplifies further to (T&F). i.e. F as anything AND F = F.

3. When we negate F with ! operator, we get !F which is T.

4. The second part of the main expression is (T|(s|(((j|(F&(!F)))|T)|T))). Within this, (F&(!F)) = F since anything AND F = F. So, this reduces to (s|(j|T)) which further simplifies to T as anything OR T=T.

We also know that any value or itself equals the value and any value and itself equals the value.

Now start to simplify.

Step 1: We have logical AND with F and T. We have (F&T). This expression would simplify to F, because false and anything gives false. So our equation becomes

(((g|g)&g)|((((i&T)&((i&(!(T&(F&F))))&(i&(i|((i|i)&i)))))&F)&T))

Step 2: Similarly (T&(F&F)) simplify to F, as False and anything gives False. We replace it in our equation

(((g|g)&g)|((((i&T)&((i&!(F)))&(i&(i|((i|i)&i)))))&F)&T))

Step 3: Again we simplify ! (F) where F is False. Logical not of False is True (T). So equation becomes

(((g|g)&g)|((((i&T)&((i&T))&(i&(i|((i|i)&i)))))&F)&T))

Step 4: we simplify ((i|i)&i) meaning i or i and i would gives i. We replace it in the equation

Step 5: Then i and i would also gives us i. We replace it in the equation

(((g|g)&g)|((((i&T)&(i&T)&i)&F)&T))

Step 6: And we simplify ((i&T)&(i&T)) to (i&T), since i & T or i & T gives i & T. Rewriting it in equation

(((g|g)&g)|((((i&T)&i)&F)&T))

Step 7: As we know that anything and False gives False, so we simplify ((i&T)&i)&F to F. Now we replace it in the equation 

(((g|g)&g)|(F&T))

Step 8: Again apply the concept anything and False gives False, (F&T) would simplify to F.

So after all simplification we have (((g|g)&g)|F)

Step 9: Now we simplify (g|g) to g as any value or itself gives itself. 

((g&g)|F)

Step 10: Similarly we simplify (g&g) as g as any value and itself gives itself.

Now let's simplify further:

'T&k&F' simplifies to 'F' (because 'and' operation with F gives F) and 'F&F&(p&F|T)&T' simplifies to 'F' (because 'and' operation with F gives F).

So, the whole expression simplifies to:

F|F

As mentioned earlier, 'or' operation with False (F) gives the variable or the statement itself. hence, 'F|F' would be F. 

Thus, the given logic formula simplifies to False (F).",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. To start, we simplify the (((F|T)&(T|T))) portion of the equation to T because anything ""or-ed"" with False is itself, and anything ""and-ed"" with True is also itself. 

2. The (F|(F|F)) simplifies to F, as F or F always equals F. 

3. The ((g|F)&T|g)&F section of the equation simplifies to F, as anything ""and-ed"" with F equals F. 

4. Now, we are left with !(F|F)&F, which simplifies to !F&F. As not False equals True, the equation further simplifies to T&F, which equals F (because anything ""and-ed"" with F equals F). 

5. In the first part of the equation, the (f&(f&f)) part simplifies to just f because anything ""and-ed"" with itself equals itself. 

6. Since f & F equals F (as anything ""and-ed"" with F equals F), this brings us to F|F.

7. Finally, F | F equals F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Semantically, (X & T) equals to X, because ""and"" operation with true does not change the value of X. So, the formula simplifies to:

   ((k&k)&(k&(((w&w)&((w|(F&F))&(!(F&F))))|T)|(!(T&T))))

2. As well as (X & X) equals to X, so, the formula simplifies to:
   
   (k&(k&(((w&w)&((w|(F&F))&(!(F&F))))|T)|(!(T&T))))

3. According to the property of the ""and"" operation, (F&F) equals to F, and (!F) or not false equals to T. So (w|(F&F)) simplifies to w. Also, using this property simplifies (!(T&T)) to F. So, the formula now transforms to:

   (k&(k&((w&w)&(w&T))|F)

4. (X&T) is equal to X, and (w&w) is equal to w. So, the formula simplifies to:
   
   (k&(k&w)|F)

5. (k&w) could be interpreted as ""k and w hold true simultaneously"", and ""k and (k and w)"" is equivalent to ""k and w"". The ""or"" operation with false does not change the value, so, the final simplified logical formula is:

2. Similarly, any variable or literal 'and' with False (m & F) results in False.
   So, ((((m|m)&T)&T)&F) simplifies to F.

3. (((n|F)) simplifies to n because n | F is n. 

4. From point 1, !(((T&T)|T)|F) simplifies to False because (((T&T)|T)|F) simplifies to True and !True is False.
   
5. Next, (n|(n|(!False))) which simplifies to n since (!False) is True and n | True simplifies to n.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify the expression in several steps:

1. ""F & T"" is always false (F), because False and anything is False.
2. ""z | F"" is always equal to z, because anything or False is just that thing.
3. ""h | F"" is h for the same reason.
4. ""g & F"" is always False, hence the expression becomes ""h | F"" which again simplifies to h.
5. ""h & (h | h)"" is just h, since anything AND-ed with itself is just itself.
6. ""F | T"" is always true (T), because False or anything is that thing.
7. So, isn't necessary to simplify anything in ""!(h & T)"" because the expression always simplifies to ""!'thing'"".
8. So, ""z & T"" is just z, because anything AND-ed with True is just that thing.

So, (((z & z) & T)) & (z | !'thing')) | z & T) simplifies to (((z) & T) & (z | !'thing')) | z).

But any logical expression interacting with True (T) is just the logical expression itself. Thus, ((z) & (z | !'thing')) | z simplifies further to (z & (z | !'thing')) | z.

Consider z & (z | X). For whatever X, this simplifies to just z. Hence, (z & z) | z simplifies to just z | z, equivalent to z.

2. `T&x` will always equal to x. So `(T&((F&T)&F))` equals to `(F&F)` which is False.
4. `F|T` will always be True. So in `(T&((z|F)|(F|T)))`, `(F|T)` will be True making `(T&((z|F)|True))` equal to `True`.
5. `x|F` will always equal to x. Then `(T|T)|F` equals `True|F`, which equals to `True`.
6. Thus `(F&((T|T)|F)))` equals to `F & True`, which equals to `False`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, OR (|) operation with False (F) doesn't alter the other operand. Thus, (v|F) simplifies to v. And the operations ((v|F)|F), (v|F|F) or ((v|F)|F) simplify to v.
2. Similarly, AND (&) operation with True (T) doesn't alter the other operand. Thus, (T&(F&F)) simplifies to (T&F) which simplifies to False (F) and ((T&F)&T) simplifies to F.
3. The NOT (!) operation inverses the operand value. Thus, !(F&T) simplifies to !F, which is True (T).
4. We also know that AND (&) operation with False (F) results in False (F). Thus, (((f&T)&T)&F) simplifies to F and (!(((f&T)&T)&F)) simplifies to True (T).
5. AND operation of any entity with its NOT operation results in False. Thus, (h&(((T&(F&F))&T)|F)) simplifies to (h&F) and that's equal to F.
6. Any entity OR with T results in T. So, any expression that includes ""|T"" simplifies to T. Thus, ((h&((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|T simplifies to T.
7. Therefore, ((v|((v|F)|F))&((h&(((((T&(F&F))&T)|F)|(!(((f&T)&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)) simplifies to (v&T), which simplifies to v.

Step 2: B&B is identical to B because True AND True is True, and False AND False is False. Also, (T|F) is always True because True OR with any value is always True.
