A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, it's obvious that any logical OR operation with True always results in True. So we have:

k | T = T,
m | F = m,
l | T = T,
F | T = T.

So the expression simplifies to:

(x & (x & (F | (T & ((m & (m & m | m)) | T)))) | (F | (F & T)).

Next, a logical AND operation with False always results in False, so:

F & T = F,
F | F = F.

Now the expression is:

(x & (x & (F | T)) | F).

As stated before, any logical OR operation with True always results in True. So:

F | T = T.

Now our expression is:

(x & (x & T)) | F.

A logical AND operation with True does not change the other value. So:

x & T = x.

Hence, we get:

(x & x) | F.

A logical AND operation of the same variables essentially results in that variable itself.

So, our final simplified expression is:

x | F.

Circling back to the fundamental rule that an OR operation with False does not change the other value, we find:

x | F = x.

2. (f&f) simplifies to ""f"".
3. ((f&T)|(F&T)) simplifies to ""f"" (because F&anything = F and anything|T = T).
4. Now replace these values in the main formula: ((f & ((f | ((f & ((f & T) | (F & T)))) | f) & (f & (!F)))) & (F | (z | T))) becomes ((f & ((f | (f | f)) & f)) & (F | T)).

Now our formula becomes:
!((F | !((F&T)&F)) & (k | (T&!F) | F))

Following the precedence of the NOT operator, we proceed to:
F&!F = F (False AND NOT False returns False and NOT True returns False)

Our formula now reads:
!((F | !(F&F)) & (k | T | F))

We simplify the OR operation where T or F is present, because any value OR T results in T:

F|T = T (False OR True returns True)
F|F = F (False OR False returns False)

!((F|!F)&(k|T))

We can simplify NOT F as T, and the expression becomes:

4. (f&T) - This can be either True or False, depending upon the value of ""f"".

Step 4: T | anything simplifies to True, because anything True or False will be True when taken Or with True.

Step 5: Let's also simplify the expression (((q | (q & q)) & (T | ((!T) & (o & False)))) & (False | False)).

Step 6: (q & q) is the same as q, because something AND itself is just itself.

Step 7: (False | False) is False, because something OR something else is true only when at least one of them is True.

1) !F = T (negation of False is True)

So let's substitute these known values in the bitmask:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify expressions with constants T (True) and F (False):

1. F&T = False   (since both conditions must be true for the ""&"" operator to result in true, it becomes false because F is always false)

2. y|F = y   (since the ""or"" operator outputs true if at least one condition is true, it becomes y because y is or isn't true)

3. F|T = T   (since the ""or"" operator outputs true if at least one condition is true, it becomes true because T is always true)

4. !F = T   (since !F stands for not false, it becomes true)

So, the expression becomes:

((y|False)&((y|(y|((y|y)|(y&T))))|(!T)|F))

We then simplify further:

1. y|y = y   (since y or y is still y)

2. y&y = y   (since y and y is still y)

3. !T = F

So, the expression becomes:

(y&(y|(y|y)|F))

Now we simplify even further due to the fact that anything OR-ed (|) with False is simply itself and anything AND-ed (&) with True is itself too:

1. y|F = y

2. y|y = y

3. !F = T

So, the expression becomes:

""n | F"" is n, as ""or"" operation with false is equal to the original value. Also ""anything & n"" is just that ""anything"" if this ""anything"" is logically equivalent to n or smaller, so the first part of the formula simplifies to n.

""F&(!F)"" is always false because one is the negation of the other. So ""j&(F&(!F))"" is false too. But ""false | T"" is true, as ""or"" requires only one true value to be true. 

So, if we collect these pieces together, the formula simplifies to:

(n & true & F)

3. T&T is T, therefore simplifying further gives us:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify the True and False values. 

(T&F) simplifies to F, (o&F) simplifies to F, (!F) simplifies to T.

So, our initial formula now looks like this:

((i&i)|(((x&((!(F|F))|T))&(T|(!(!(!T)))))|T))

Now, !(F|F) simplifies to T and !(!(!T)) simplifies to F. Which makes the formula:

((i&i)|(((x&(T|T))&(T|F))|T))).

Now, any value OR ""True"" equals True. Therefore, we can simplify ((x&(T|T))&(T|F)) to T. So, the formula now becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that the semantic of logical not (written as !) applied to T (which stands for True) will result in F (False). That's because not True is False.

Third, the logical and (written as &) with F (False) doesn't depend on any other operands, which means any expression a&F or F&a is equivalent to F. 

Then, based on the above conclusions, let's work out the provided logic formula:

(4) (!T) equals F, negation of True is False.

(5) Thus so far the expression becomes:
    (((i|i)|(((p&(e|T))|F)&F))&(T|F))

Next:

(6) (e|T) equals T, again anything or-ed with True is always True.

(7) (p&T) can be reduced to just p, as anything and-ed with True is equal to itself. 

(8) ((p&True)|F) simplifies to p, because anything or-ed with False is equal to itself.

(9) (p&F) equals F, anything and-ed with False is always False.

Now replace the above calculations in expression and you get:

In the above expression (T|T) is T (as True or anything is True), ((T)&T) is T (as True and True is True) and (k|F) is equivalent to k (as k or False is k)

We replace these new calculations in expression and you get:
((T|F)|(T&(T&(F&k)))).

In the above expression (T|F) is T (as True or False is True)

We replace this calculation in expression and you get:
(T|(T&(F&k))).

The expression (T|(T&(F&k))), you can rewrite as (T|(F&T&k)). The T will consume all the rest and expression will simplify to T:

   - Similarly, A & F = F, meaning something and False is always False.
   - A | T = T, which means something or True is always True.
   - A | F = A, which means something or False is always something itself.

2. Start to simplify the expression inside the brackets from the deepest level. The expression (T&T) is T, then ((T&T)&(T&T)) is also T.

3. Given that anything Or T(T | anything) is always T, the condition (T|(T|(((T&T)&(T&T))|T))) simplifies to T. 
   
4. Hence, the left side of your formula r&(T|(T|(((T&T)&(T&T))|T))))|r simplifies to r| r which is r.

5. On the right side, (T|F) is True, and ((F&((T|F)&T))&F) is F (because anything And False is always False). When this is taken Or with T as in ((F&((T|F)&T))&F)|T, the whole expression becomes T. 

6. Again, anything And False is always False. So, the right side of your formula (F&(((F&((T|F)&T))&F)|T)) simplifies to F. 

7. Therefore, the simplified version of your whole logical expression r&(T|(T|(((T&T)&(T&T))|T))))|r)&(F&(((F&((T|F)&T))&F)|T)) is r & F. According to the rule mentioned previously, anything And False is always False. So, the result is F.",F,F

3. 'F|F' OR 'F' equals 'F'.
4. 'h' AND (T&F) equals 'F', because 'T' AND 'F' results in 'F'.
5. w AND 'F' equals 'F'.
6. 'T' OR 'F' equals 'T'.
7. (T&F) AND F equals 'F'.
8. So something like 'n' OR 'T' would always be 'T'.

Plugging all the above results back, we get
!((T|F) & F | T), which becomes

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, recall that any value ""x"" ORed with itself (x | x) is just ""x"" and anything ANDed with False (x & F) is False. Also, ""x"" ORed with False (x | F) is ""x"" and NOT False (!F) is True.
Moreover, any value ANDed with True (x & T) is just ""x"" and anything ORed with True (x | T) is True.

Starting from the innermost part of the equation, (((r|F)|(T&F))&(!F))|r is simplified as follows :

So, the original formula now becomes ((g|g)|(r&F))|((g|(g&!F)) & T).

Now processing ((g|g)|(r&F)), this simplifies into g or F which is g.

Also processing (g|(g&!F) & T), since !F is True this simplifies into g or (g & True) which is g or g resulting in g.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify the F (false) values inside the inner parentheses:

- (o|F) becomes o because anything OR false is that anything itself.
- ((F|F)&F) also simplifies to F because false AND any value is always false.

The simplified logic formula becomes: ((((s|((o&F)&F))&T)&T)|((!(T&F))&F))|(!F) 

Next, further simplifications based on the F (false), T (true) values and properties of logical operations:

- (o&F) & F simplifies to F because o AND false again results in false (anything AND false is always false).
- (T&F) simplifies to F because true AND false is always false.
- Also, !F (not false) becomes T (true).

So, our formula now looks like this: (((s|F)&T)&T)|((!F)&F)|T.

Several additional steps can be applied:

- (s|F) simplifies to s.
- (s & T) simplifies to s, because anything AND true is always that anything itself.
- (!F & F) simplifies to (T & F), which then simplifies to F.
- At the end of each operation | F, we can dismiss the F.

So, your logic formula simplifies to: s | T.

Finally, ""s | T"" simplifies to T, because anything OR true is always true. Therefore, the resultant value of the entire expression is T.",T,T

3. Then, if we look at anything AND True, it is always itself. The equation simplifies to:

4. (!(!((F|T)&F))) simplifies to !(!!F) because (F|T)&F simplifies to F&F and then to F, so !(!!F) is equivalent to F.
5. v|((!(!((F|T)&F)))&F) simplifies to v|(F&F) and then to v|F, which further simplifies to v because any variable ORed with false (F) retains its original value.
6. F&((F&(!F))|F) simplifies to F&(F|F) and then to F&F and finally to F.
7. e&(F&((F&(!F))|F))) simplifies to e&F which is F because any variable ANDed with false predicts false.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the innermost brackets with constants:

1. T|T = T (since true OR true always equals true)

3. F|(T|T) = F|T = T (since false OR true equals true)
4. F|T = T (since false OR true equals true)

The simplified formula is: ((c|c)&((l|T)&(m|(T|T)))) which further becomes:

5. c|c = c (since X OR X will always give the value of X)
6. l|T = T (since any value OR true equals true)
7. m|(T|T) = m|T = T (since any value OR true equals true)

The final simplified formula is: ((c)&(T)&(T)), and further simplification of this formula is:

Next, simplify (!(!...)) form (negation of negation is equivalent to the original statement), the formula becomes:

((m|m)|F)|((((T&(T|(!F)))&((F|(F&T))&T))|F)&F)) can be simplified to (m|F)|((((T&T)&T)|F)&F). 

The logical OR of something and False equals to the original value itself, so (T&T)&T equals T and then, ((m|F)|((T|F)&F)) simplifies to m|((T|F)&F).

The logical OR of something and True equals to True, so T|F equals to T and then, m|(T&F) simplifies to m|F.

=> (c|(c&True)) & (s|(F|((False&T)&True)|T))

Next, note that ‘c&True’ is equal to ‘c’, and ‘False&T’ is always equal to False. 

=> (c|c) & (s|(F|False|T))

Next, ‘c|c’ is equal to ‘c’, and ‘F|False|T’ is equal to True. So, we get:

Finally, because ‘s|True’ is always equal to True, the entire expression simplifies to ‘c’. So, the simplified logic formula is ‘c’.",c,c

(((v|(F&T))&v)&(((((v|F)&((v|(F&F))|(T|(F&F))))|(v|v))|v)&v)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F&T is always False (since False AND anything is False), so we can simplify (F&T) to just F. We have:

    (((v|F)&v)&(((((v|F)&((v|F)|T))|(v|v))|v)&v))

2. v|F is equal to v, because any value OR False is just the value itself. We can replace (v|F) with v:

    (((v&v)&(((((v&((v|F)|T))|(v|v))|v)&v)))

3. (v|F) is equal to v, again because any value OR False is just the value itself. Replace (v|F) too with v:

    (((v&v)&(((((v&(v|T))|(v|v))|v)&v)))

4. v|T (a value OR True) is always True. We can replace v|T with T:

    (((v&v)&(((((v&T))|(v|v))|v)&v)))

5. But x AND True is always x itself (in this case, v). So, (v&T) becomes v:

    (((v&v)&(((((v))|(v|v))|v)&v)))

6. At this point, we see v|v multiple times. That's just v (because any value OR itself is itself). So replace all instances of v|v with v:

    (((v&v)&(((((v))|(v))|v)&v)))

7. This is still full of v&v, which, like with OR, just equals v. So replace all those, too:

    ((v&((v|v)&v)))

8. Again, v|v is just v. Replace it:

    ((v&(v&v)))

9. And once again, v&v is just v. Replace it:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, note that T|F simplifies to T (True OR False is always True).

Next, note that l&l simplifies to l (a value AND itself is just the same value).

The term T&T simplifies to T (True AND True is always True).

So far, we arrive at: (l|(l&T))|(l&((l&l)&(((l&((T)&(T)))&l)&((l&l)&T))))

That means l&((T)&(T)) simplifies to l (Since True and anything results in anything).

Additionally, l&((l&l)&(((l&(l)&l)&((l&l)&T)))) simplifies to l 
(Since anything and True results in anything, meaning that adding more 'l' joined by '&' will not change the outcome).

Since (l|(l&T)) equals l (since anything ORed with False is just itself, and anything ORed with 'l'True results in 'True' or 'l', but both are superseded by 'l' because of the nature of OR gate, the True would only matter if in case 'l' was false and vice versa) and since l|(l) is also 'l', the initial logical formula simplifies completely to l.",l,l

- Also, note that ""(F&anything)"" will always be False - this is because anything And'ed with False will always result in False.
- Not False, ""!F"", is True.

So, let's apply these rules:

- (T|(F|F)) simplifies to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Simplify the terms involving T and F:

   - T stands for True and F stands for False, and o can be either True or False
   - o|T simplifies to T, because OR operation with True always results in True
   - F&(s&(F|(!T))) simplifies to F, because AND operation with False always results in False
   - ((F|T)&(F|F)) simplifies to T, since OR with False results in original value and then AND with T is always True, so F&(!T) simplifies to F, as AND operation with False results in False.
   - ((F&(!T))&F) simplifies to F, as AND operation with False results in False.

So, the expression simplifies to !(T&(F|F)), which simplifies to the logical negation of (T&F). 

2) The term T&F simplifies to F, because AND operation with False always results in False.

So the expression simplifies to !F.

3) The negation of False (!F) is True.
