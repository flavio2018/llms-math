A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the operation inside the most inner brackets.

""MIN 3 5"" will give us the minimum between 3 and 5, which is 3.

""SM 6 5"" will give us the sum of 6 and 5 modulo 10. Since the sum of 6 and 5 is 11, and 11 mod 10 is 1, the result is 1.

We have obtained two intermediate results. Let's substitute them into our expression:

""MAX 5 5"" and ""MAX 7 7"" both give us the maximum of the same number, so they will return 5 and 7 respectively. Thus, we have:

[MIN 1 0] = 0 (since 0 is the minimum between 1 and 0).

So, the expression becomes:

Then we can add these smaller parts to the main expression:
