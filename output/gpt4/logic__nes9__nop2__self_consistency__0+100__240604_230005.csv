a) (!T) simplifies to F because ""not"" (!) of True (T) is False (F).

The expressions i|i, m|m, c|c, and T|F always give the value of the operands i, m, c, and T respectively because in 'OR' operation, if either of operand is True, the value is True. Here, both the operands are same.

So, the expression becomes:

(((k|F)&F)|!((i&m&c&((j|T)&F&T))))

In the expression j|T, if either of the operand is True, the value is True. Hence, it resolves to True. Then this True value is &'ed' with False which gives False (in an 'AND' operation, if any operand is False, the result is False).

So, the expression further simplifies to:

(((k|F)&F)|!(i&m&c&F&T))

This simplifies to:

(((k|F)&F)|!(i&m&c&F))

In the expression k|F, if either of the operand is True, the value is True. Here one operand is False which doesn't affect 'OR' operation. So it resolves to k. And k 'AND' with False results in False (as 'AND' with False always gives False).

So, the expression further simplifies to:

(F|!(i&m&c&F))

Now (i&m&c&F) will be False, because 'AND' with False gives False. Then 'NOT' of False gives True.

So, the expression further simplifies to:

(F|T)

Following that, let's simplify !(F) which is the negation of False which results in True.

Finally, simplify (T|(!F)). A logical OR operation (|) gives True when at least one operand is True. Since T | (!F), which results in T | T (since (!F) is True), it will be True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First simplify the repeating conjunctions (AND operations), because a value ANDed with itself will just result in the original value:
- (x&x&x&x) simplifies to x.
- (d|d)&(d&d) simplifies to d&d which further simplifies to d.
- (T&T) simplifies to T.

So, we have:
- (((x)|((y&((r|(r&T))|(d&T)|T))|T))).

The expression (r&T) will only be true if r is true. But if r is true, then the whole expression (r|(r&T)) also will be true. Therefore, (r|(r&T)) simplifies to r. 

Similar, the expressions (x&T), (d&T) and (y&T) will be T if x, d and y are T, respectively.

Therefore, our formula simplifies to:
- ((x)|((y&(r|d|T))|T)).

Because anything ORed with T (TRUE) always ends up being T (TRUE) (since if one operand is true the result is true, which is the definition of logical OR), (r|T) and (T|T) both also simplify to T, resulting in:

- ((x)|((y&T)|T)).

Here, the expression ((y&T)|T) simplifies to T, because either y is true, in which case y&T = T and T|T = T, or y is false, in which case y&T = F and F|T = T.

So our final result is:

The part ((F|(T|(F&T)))|F)&F) simplifies to F, because the part in the inner bracket is T, as T ""or"" anything is T, and T ""and"" with F is F.

Now, True and any statement is equal to that statement (True is the identity for the logical and operator). Thus,

(r&True) becomes r.

Additionally, True or any statement is equal to True, and False and any statement is equal to False. So,
(T|F) => True and (!True) => False and (F&True) => False.

Substituting these into the equation we get:
((((r|((r&r)|r))&T)|r)&(!((l&(T&False))&T))).

Since logical and is associative, so r&r&r = r, thus,
((r&r)|r) => r.

Substituting into the equation we get:

(((r&T)|r)&(!((l&False)&T))).

Now note that x&False => False. So,
(l&False) => False and ((False)&T) => False.

Hence, the inner bracket becomes not of False => True.

Substituting these into the equation we get:

(((r&T)|r)&True).
Observing that (r&T) = r because T == True, we can simplify the equation to :

(((r|r) & True)

As logical or is associative and idempotent, so x|x = x. Thus, (r|r) => r.

Also (F|(T&T)) equals F|T equals T. 

Looking at ((F|T)|F) gives T.

Also, (F|F) is F and (F&F) is also F. So, the term ((F|F)&(F&F)) simplifies to F. Hence, l|(!(F)) simplifies to l|(!F) = l|T = T.

We also have (F|(!F)) = F|T = T, (T|(T|(F|(!F)))) simplifies to T|(T|T) = T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, we can simplify the logical formula by resolving inner clauses using properties of logical operators. 

Any value AND False (i.e., X & F) is always False, 

Any value OR True (i.e., X | T) is always True, 

NOT True is False while NOT False is True.

Similarly, (n&n) is logically equivalent to n.

So here are the equivalent transformations based on these logical operator properties:

- ((F|(T&F)) becomes (F|F) which simplifies to F.
- ((T&F)) becomes F.
- (n&n) simplifies to n.

Applying these transformations, the given expression simplifies to:

(((T&((F&(F|(F&F))|T))|!(T&(F|(T&(!n|T))))))|(F&F)).

2. We can further simplify resulting formula:

- (T&(F|F)) simplifies to T&F which is F.
- ((F|F)) simplifies to F.
- (T&(F|(T&(!n|T)))) simplifies to T&(!n|T) as T&(F|X) = T&X and !(T&(!n|T)) = !(!n|T) = n&!T as according to De Morgan’s law !(p&q) = !p | !q.

So the intermediate expression after simplification becomes:

((T&((F&F)|T))|((n&!T))|(F&F)).

3. Now we can simplify this expression further:


- (T&((F&F)|T)) simplifies to T&T which is T.
- (F&F) simplifies to F.
- (n&!T) simplifies to n&F which is F as T is generally true.

So the resulting expression after simplification is:

(T|(F))|(F) which simplifies to T.

F or F is still F, so we simplify it as:
(((((s|s)|((k|(k|F))&T))|s)&s)|((s|(s|s))|s)).

T and F is F, so we simplify it as:

From the above simplification, an expression a or a = a and an expression a and F = F. These can be simplified to:
((s|(k&F)|s)&s)|(s|s|s).

An expression a or a = a. This step can be simplified to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) First, resolve all the redundancy for logical or. X | X = X, for logical and X & T = X and for logical or X | F = X. So the formula becomes:

(((((n|((m&T)&F))&(n|!(T|F)))&(n|F))|F)|((w|F)|T)).

2) Resolve the logical and and logical or with constant True or False. (m & T & F) = False because anything AND False is False. Also, T | F = True and !(True) = False, n | F = n, w | F = w. So now we have:

(((n|False)&(n|False)&n)|F)|(w|T).

3) Now resolve redundancy again with logical or. n | False = n and w | T = T. Also, anything AND False is False. 

((n&n&n)|F)|T.

4) And then, of course, the redundancy with logical and. X & X = X:

(n|F)|T.

5) The last step is to apply again the rules for logical or with constant True or False. n | F = n, and X | T = T:

T. 

In conclusion, the simplified logic formula given the symbols and their semantics is T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, F & T will always be False regardless of T and F, so z | (F&T) simplifies to z. 
2. The second part consists of many operations, where h originates from ""(h | (F | (g & F)))"" and ""(h & (h | h)) | F)"". In the end, it comes down to h | T, which will always be True, regardless of h and T.
3. Then, !(((h | (F | (g & F))) & ((h & (h | h)) | F)) | T) simplifies to False because anything or True will always be True and not of true is False.

2. F&F is always False, and anything AND with False is also False. So, (T&(F&F))&T simplifies to F. 

3. The value F OR F is just F, so (((T&(F&F))&T)|F) simplifies to F. 

4. For ((f&T)&T)&F, the part inside the parenthesis can be any value but it AND with False will always result in False. So, ((f&T)&T)&F simplifies to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (q|q) simply is q as either of q being True makes it True. So, the formula simplifies to (((w|(T&((q&q)|T)))&F)|(((!(!(((w&F)|((F&T)|(F&T)))&F)))|T)|F)).

2. Same thing for (F&T)|(F&T), it is just F&T. But False AND anything is False. So, the formula simplifies to (((w|(T&(q|T)))&F)|(((!(!(w&F)&F))|T)|F)).

3. (q&q) is just q because True & True = True and False & False = False. So, formula simplifies to (((w|(T&(q|T)))&F)|(((!(!(w&F)&F))|T)|F)).

4. The expression (T&(q|T)), is True as anything OR True is True and True AND anything is anything itself. So, (((w|T)&F)|(((!(!(w&F)&F))|T)|F)).

5. But (w|T) simplifies to T as anything OR True is True. And, (((T&F)|((!(!(w&F)&F))|T)|F)).

7. But (w&F) is false. So, ((F|(!(!F)&F|T))|F).

8. (!(!F)&F) simplifies to F as not of False is True and True AND False is False. So, ((F|F|T)|F).

2. Anything | T = T, Because for 'or' to be true any condition can be true. If one is T (True) then the actual value is T.

Using these two rules we can simplify parts of the expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify from the innermost parentheses:

T&F will result in F, because when joined by 'and', both must be true to get a True;
Thus, d&(T&(T&F)) will become d&F, which will become F;
Next, we have F|T|T, 'or' operation requires at least one of them to be true, so entire expression becomes T;
Then, the entire left-hand side T&((((d&(T&(T&F)))|T)|T)|F) simplifies to T&T, which will result in T. 

Same goes with the right side of the initial expression, q&T will result as q (since T doesn’t affect the result), then q|T which results in T;
Then we have i&i bitwise AND of any variable with itself, the output will be the same variable i.e. we get i as the result;
Next, i|i which results in i;

Becomes: 

((((e&(e&((e&(l|T))&T)))|(F|(F&(!T))))|F)&(e&e)).

Next, any expression or logical operator with ""T"" and ""F"" using logical or (|) will be equal to ""T"". So, we simplify (T|F) to T, (l|T) to T and (b&b) to b.

((((e&(e&((e&T)&T)))|(F|(F&(!T))))|F)&(e&e)).

Next, any expression or logical operator with ""T"" using logical and (&), will be equal to that expression itself. So, we simplify (e&T) to e 

(((e&(e&e))|(F|(F&F)))|F)&(e&e).

Next, (F&F) will be equal to ""F"". So the formula becomes:
