A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, !T means NOT T, which equals F (because T is True, and opposite of True is False).
2. T & T equals T (because True AND True yields True).
3. T & F equals F (because True AND False yields False).
4. Therefore, the formula simplifies to ((F | T) | F).
5. Next, F | T equals T (because False OR True yields True).
6. Therefore, the final simplified formula is (T | F).
7. T | F equals T (because True OR False yields True).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The step-by-step simplification goes as follow:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. y OR y OR y: This is always just y. Hence, the above equation becomes (y&(y|(y&T))).
2. y OR (y AND T): y is True would turn the whole statement True, regardless of the second part. If y is False, the second part (y AND T) also returns False. Hence, this term simplifies to y.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression T&T is always true. Therefore, the given expression first simplifies to:

(i&True)&((i&True)&i))

In the expression i&True, if i is True, the expression is True, and if i is False, the expression is False. This means the whole expression simply depends on i. Therefore, the given expression further simplifies to:

i & (i & i)

In the expression i & i, if i is True, the expression is True, and if i is False, the expression is False. This means the whole expression simply depends on i again. Therefore, the final simplified form of the original expression is just:

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((c&c)|T)&(l&(T&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, (c&c) means c AND c, which simplifies to just c because a statement logically ANDed with itself is just the statement. So, consider the first part as (c|T), where ""|"" represents a logical OR. This means c OR True. No matter what the value of c is (True or False), ORing with True always results in True. This means, the first part simplifies to True.

Second, taking (T&F). Here T&F means True AND False, which always evaluates to False because a statement is True only if both parts of the AND are True. So here, l&(T&F) becomes l&F.

Finally, we come to the situation where AND is applied i.e., True&l&F. Since we already know that False ANDed with anything will give False, the overall simplification becomes False. 

So, the simplified version of (((c&c)|T)&(l&(T&F))) is False.",False,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The redundancy of conditions can be simplified as follows:

((q&q)|((q|q)|(q|F)))

which is equivalent to:

(q|((q|q)|(q|F)))

since (q&q) = q.

We can observe that (q|q) is the same thing as q, so considering (q|q) the formula simplifies to:

(q|((q)|(q|F)))

We know that q|F is equal to q, anything 'or' False is just itself, so:

(q|((q)|(q)))

Those multiple 'or' q terms are redundant, since q|q = q. So, we can further simplify it by removing extra q terms:
