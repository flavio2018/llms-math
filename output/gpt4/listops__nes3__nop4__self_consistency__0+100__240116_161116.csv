A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve the expressions inside the brackets. 

For the expression [SM 1 0 4 7], SM stands for Sum Modulo 10. So we have to add the numbers and then take the remainder when divided by 10. 

1 + 0 + 4 + 7 = 12 

12 Modulo 10 = 2 

So [SM 1 0 4 7]=2

Similarly for the expression [MIN 9 4 4 9], MIN stands for Minimum. So the minimum value among 9, 4, 4, and 9 is 4.

So [MIN 9 4 4 9]=4

Therefore [SM 3 [SM 1 0 4 7] 0 [MIN 9 4 4 9]] becomes [SM 3 2 0 4] which equals (3 + 2 + 0 + 4)%10 = 9.

Now let's move to another part of the expression, [MIN 8 7 9 8]. The minimum value of 8, 7, 9, and 8 is 7.

So [MIN 8 7 9 8] = 7

For the expression [MAX 6 4 4 1] where MAX stands for Maximum, the value of that expression would be maximum value among 6, 4, 4, and 1 which is 6 

So [MAX 6 4 4 1] = 6

That means [SM [MIN 8 7 9 8] [MAX 6 4 4 1] 4 8] becomes [SM 7 6 4 8] which equals (7 + 6 + 4 + 8) % 10 = 5.

Now the full expression simplifies to [MIN 9 5 9 9]. The minimum value of 9, 5, 9, and 9 is 5.

So [MIN 9 5 9 9] = 5.

SM stands for sum modulo 10, so let's solve:

[SM 4 6 8 2] = (4+6+8+2) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0,
[SM 6 8 8 3] = (6+8+8+3) mod 10 = 25 mod 10 = 5,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should start with the innermost brackets for both MIN and MAX. We find the minimum and maximum numbers in the brackets:

MIN 1 9 1 3 = 1
MIN 9 9 2 3 = 2
MAX 7 8 = 8
MAX 4 8 6 3 = 8

Then, we replace these values back in the initial expression:

[SM 2 1 2 9]

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to calculate the values within the deepest brackets.

In this case, those are [MAX 2 4 9 2], [SM 8 9 3 4] and [SM 4 0 9 7].

The maximum value between 2, 4, 9 and 2 is 9.

The sum of 8, 9, 3 and 4, modulo 10, is (8+9+3+4)%10 = 24%10 = 4.

The sum of 4, 0, 9 and 7, modulo 10, is (4+0+9+7)%10 = 20%10 = 0.

So, these three expressions become [MAX 9], [SM 4] and [SM 0], respectively.

We then substitute these values back into the expression to get:

[SM 4 [MAX 4 9 4 4] 8 [SM 1 0 [MAX 9 0 4 3] 2]].

Next, we calculate [MAX 4 9 4 4] and [MAX 9 0 4 3].

The maximum value between 4, 9, 4 and 4 is 9.

The maximum value between 9, 0, 4 and 3 is 9.

So, these expressions become [MAX 9] and [MAX 9], respectively.

We then substitute these values back into the expression to get:

[SM 4 9 8 [SM 1 0 9 2]].

Next, we calculate [SM 1 0 9 2].

The sum of 1, 0, 9 and 2, modulo 10, is (1+0+9+2)%10 = 12%10 = 2.

So, this expression becomes [SM 2].

We then substitute this value back into the expression to get:

Finally, we calculate [SM 4 9 8 2].

The sum of 4, 9, 8 and 2, modulo 10, is (4+9+8+2)%10 = 23%10 = 3.

[MAX 3 4 2 6 2 9] results in 9.
[MAX 5 8 0 0] results in 8.
[MIN 2 3 5 8] results in 2.

The result of [MAX 9 2 5 9] is 9.
The result of [MAX 3 0 7 5] is 7.
The result of [MAX 7 9 9 9] is 9.
The result of [MAX 5 6 1 5] is 6.

Substitute them back into the original expression:
[SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1]

Now solve the MIN operation:
The result of [MIN 9 7 6 1] is 1.

Substitute this back into the expression:
[SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 1 1]

Now sum the numbers in the nested expression [SM 4 9 6 7] and take modulo 10 since the operation is SM:

Now sum these numbers and take modulo 10:

- SM 3 1 1 4 is equivalent to (3 + 1 + 1 + 4) mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9

So the expression now becomes:

Second, we'll solve the MIN (minimum) parts:

Do the remaining SM (sum modulo 10) calculations:

- SM 0 1 1 8 is equivalent to (0 + 1 + 1 + 8) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0

So the expression becomes:

- MAX 7 9 0 9 is equivalent to taking the maximum of the set {7, 9, 0, 9}, which is 9
