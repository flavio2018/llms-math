- The modulo -100 of `-127` is `-27`.
- The modulo 100 of `72` is `72`.
- The modulo 100 of `3776` is `76`.

Adding these numbers together, we get 60 + 5 = 65. 

Third operation is (10-64). It's a subtraction which results in a negative number: 10 - 64 = -54.

Then we modulo 100 or -100 for each intermediate result:

26 modulo 100 = 26
103 modulo 100 = 3
-72 modulo -100 = -72
3960 modulo 100 = 60
