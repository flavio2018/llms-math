A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we'll solve the equations inside the nested brackets first.

A: For the first segment: 
[MIN [MAX [SM [MAX [MIN 8 1] [MAX 8 0]] [MAX [MIN 8 4] [SM 1 0]]], the minimum of 8 and 1 is 1, the maximum of 8 and 0 is 8. The sum of 1 and 8 modulo 10 is 9. The minimum of 8 and 4 is 4, the sum of 1 and 0 is 1. So, we have 
[MIN [MAX 9 [MAX 4 1]], which simplifies to
[MIN [MAX 9 4], and further simplifies to
[MIN 9]

B: For the second segment:
[MIN [MIN [MAX 0 9] [MIN 9 4]] [SM [SM 4 1] [MAX 0 6]], the maximum of 0 and 9 is 9, the minimum of 9 and 4 is 4. The sum of 4 and 1 modulo 10 is 5, the maximum of 0 and 6 is 6. So, we have
[MIN [MIN 9 4] [SM 5 6]], which simplifies to
[MIN 4 1], and further simplifies to
1

So, the first half of the entire expression is [MIN 9 1], which then simplifies to 1.

Now, let's solve the second half of the equation.

C: For the third segment:
[MIN [MIN [MAX [MIN 0 4] [MAX 3 4]] [MIN [MIN 2 5] [SM 9 5]]]], the minimum of 0 and 4 is 0, the maximum of 3 and 4 is 4. The sum of 9 and 5 modulo 10 is 4, the minimum of 2 and 5 is 2. So, we have
[MIN [MIN [MAX 0 4] 2] [MIN 2 4]], which simplifies to
[MIN [MIN 4 2] 2], and further simplifies to 
[MIN 2 2], and then to
2

D: For the fourth segment: 
[MIN [SM [SM 8 5] [MAX 4 5]] [MIN [MAX 8 9] [MIN 6 5]]], the sum of 8 and 5 modulo 10 is 3, the maximum of 4 and 5 is 5. The maximum of 8 and 9 is 9, the minimum of 6 and 5 is 5. So, we have
[MIN [SM 3 5] [MIN 9 5]], which simplifies to
[MIN 8 5], and further simplifies to
5

So, the second half of the entire expression is [MIN 2 5], which then simplifies to 2.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we'll solve all the separate expressions contained within the brackets.
To simplify things, let's denote MAX as M, MIN as m and SM as S.

M[S 8 6] = M[14] = M[4] = 4
M[7 4] = 7
Then m[M 4 7]=m[4 7]=4

m[1 7] = 1
S[3 5] = 8
Then S[m 1 7][S 3 5] = S[1 8] = S[9] = 9

At this point, MAX [SM [MIN [MAX [SM 8 6] [MAX 7 4]] [SM [MIN 1 7] [SM 3 5]]] equals MAX [SM [4 9]] equals MAX [3].

M[2 1] = 2
S[4 1] = 5
Then m[M 2 1] [S 4 1] equals m[2 5] equals 2.

m[7 1] = 1
m[1 2] = 1
Then M[m [7 1] [m 1 2]] equals M[1 1] equals 1.

MAX [MIN [MAX 2 1] [SM 4 1]] [MIN [MIN 7 1] [MIN 1 2]] equals MAX [2 1] equals 2.

m[9 5] equals 5
M[0 5] equals 5
Then m[m [9 5] [M 0 5]] equals m[5 5] equals 5.

M[6 5] equals 6
m[7 6] equals 6
Then m[M [6 5] [m 7 6]] equals m[6 6] equals 6.

MIN [MIN [MIN 9 5] [MAX 0 5]] [MIN [MAX 6 5] [MIN 7 6]] equals MIN [5 6] equals 5.

S[S[S 3 2] [m 8 3]] equals S[S[5 3]] equals S[8] equals 8.

M[M 0 8] equals M[8] equals 8
m[7 9] equals 7
Then M[M 0 8][m 7 9] equals M[8 7] equals 8.

SM [SM [SM 3 2] [MIN 8 3]] [MAX [MAX 0 8] [MIN 7 9]] equals SM [8 8] equals 16, which is 6 in modulo operation.

Finally, MAX [SM [m [M [SM 8 6] [M 7 4]] [SM [m 1 7] [SM 3 5]]] [SM [S [SM 3 2] [m 8 3]] [M [M 0 8] [m 7 9]]] equals MAX [3 6] equals 6

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, it's important to understand what each operator does. MIN takes the minimum of the operands, MAX takes the maximum and SM takes the sum of the operands modulo 10.

Starting with the innermost operations:

[SM 2 4] = 2 + 4 = 6

[MAX 5 5] = Maximum of 5 and 5 = 5

[SM 7 9] = 7 + 9 = 16, but modulo 10 this is 6 

[MAX 9 6] = Maximum of 9 and 6 = 9 

[MAX [SM 7 0] [MIN 0 2]] = MAX [7] [0] = 7 

[SM [MAX 6 5] [SM 0 7]] = SM [6] [7] = 13, but modulo 10 this is 3

[SM 9 4] = 9 + 4 = 13, but modulo 10 this is 3

[SM 9 3] = 9 + 3 = 12, but modulo 10 this is 2

[MAX 2 5] = Maximum of 2 and 5 = 5

[MIN 9 7] = Minimum of 9 and 7 = 7 

[MIN 6 7] = Minimum of 6 and 7 = 6 

[SM 5 6] = 5 + 6 = 11, but modulo 10 this is 1 

[SM 0 2] = 0 + 2 = 2 

[MAX 9 9] = Maximum of 9 and 9 = 9 

After resolving these innermost operations, the expression becomes:

[MIN [MAX [MAX [MIN 6 5] [MAX 6 9]] [SM 7 3]] [SM [MIN 3 2] [MIN 5 7]]] [MIN [SM [MIN 2 1] [MAX 2 9]]]. 

Now we reduce the next set of operations:

[MAX [MIN 6 5] [MAX 6 9]] = MAX [5] [9] = 9 

[SM 7 3] = 7 + 3 = 10, but modulo 10 this is 0

[MIN 3 2] = Minimum of 3 and 2 = 2 

[MIN 5 7] = Minimum of 5 and 7 = 5 

[SM [MIN 2 1] [MAX 2 9]] = SM [1] [9] = 10, but modulo 10 this is 0

Reducing further, we obtain:

[MIN [MAX 9 0] [SM 2 5]] [MIN [SM 0 0]] which simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to calculate all the SM operations because they are the innermost operations. 

So: SM 8 5 = 3 (since 8+5 = 13, and the modulo 10 operation gives us 3), SM 7 9 = 6, SM 2 8 = 0, SM 5 9 = 4, SM 2 1 = 3, SM 7 8 = 5, SM 6 5 = 1, SM 6 4 = 0, SM 6 8 = 4, SM 7 9 = 6, SM 8 4 = 2.

Now we compute the MIN and MAX operations: 
MIN 3 6 = 3, MAX 0 4 = 4, MIN 3 7 = 3, MIN 3 8 = 3, MAX 2 0 = 2, MIN 7 9 = 7, MIN 1 0 = 0, MAX 0 0 = 0, MIN 4 6 = 4.

After that step, our expression turns to: 
[SM [MIN 3 4] [MAX [MIN 3 3] [SM 2 5]]] [SM [MAX 7 0] [MAX 4 [SM 2 8]]]

We execute the remaining MIN and MAX operations now: 
MIN 3 4 = 3, MIN 3 3 = 3, MAX 3 7 = 7, MAX 7 0 = 7, MAX 4 2 = 4.

The resulting expression is thus: 
[SM 3 7] [SM 7 4]

Now we compute the last SM operations: 
SM 3 7 = 0, SM 7 4 = 1.

[MAX [MIN 4 8] [MIN 4 7]] = [MAX 4 4] = 4
[MAX [MIN 1 9] [MAX 3 2]] = [MAX 1 3] = 3

The expression becomes:

- The next MAX expression inside the SM operator is [MAX 1 5]. Which equals 5.
- The SM expression right next to it [SM 8 4] equals 2 (because the sum modulo 10 of 8 and 4 is 2).
- Now, we calculate the MIN expression between the result of the first MAX expression (which is 5) and the SM expression of the last step (which is 2). So, [MIN 5 2] equals 2.
- Move to the second set of innermost MIN and MAX expressions, we get [MIN 6 3] equals 3, [MAX 3 0] equals 3, [MIN 6 5] equals 5, [MAX 4 5] equals 5. Then we calculate the maximum (MAX) between each pair, the first one is 3 and the second one is 5.
- Now we need to calculate three MAX expressions, [MAX, MIN 8 5], [MIN 6 0], and [MAX 2 6]. The results are 8, 0, and 6 respectively.
- The next step is to calculate the SM expression [SM 4 2], which equals 6. Then the MAX expression between the result of the last three MAX values. The result will be 8.
- The second set of MAX expressions in the final MAX expression comes out as [SM 8 0] equals 8, [MAX 2 0] equals 2, [SM 6 7] equals 3, [MIN 5 6] equals 5. Again, the result of MAX between each pair will be 8 and 5 respectively.

1. [MAX [MAX [MAX 2 0] [MAX 0 8]]]: This will return the maximum of the nested maximum operations which are 2, 0, 0, and 8. So, the maximum is 8.

2. [MIN [MIN 9 3] [SM 7 9]]: This returns the minimum of the nested minimum operations and the sum modulo 10 operation. Minimum operation results are 3 and 7+9 mod 10 =16 mod 10 = 6. So, the minimum is 3.

3. [MAX 4 7] and [MAX 6 2]: These return 7 and 6 respectively.

4. [MAX 2 7] and [MIN 3 0]: These return 7 and 0 respectively.

5. [MAX [MAX 7 9] [MIN 5 7]]: This operation will return the maximum between the maximum operation with 7 and 9 and the minimum operation with 5 and 7. So, the result is 9.

6. [MIN [MIN 5 0] [MIN 4 7]]: This operation will return the minimum between the outcomes of two nested minimum operations. So, the result is 0.

7. [MAX [MIN 6 0] [MAX 9 0]] and [MAX [MIN 9 1] [MAX 9 8]]: These operations return 6 and 9 respectively.

Now we can substitute the results back into the original expression and simplify further.

1. [SM 8 3]: This operation will return the sum modulo 10 of 8 and 3. So, the result is 1.

2. [MIN 7 6]: This operation will return the minimum of 7 and 6. So, the result is 6.

3. [SM 7 0]: This operation will return the sum modulo 10 of 7 and 0. So, the result is 7.

4. [SM 9 0]: This operation will return the sum modulo 10 of 9 and 0. So, the result is 9.

5. [MIN 6 9]: This operation will return the minimum of 6 and 9. So, the result is 6.

Plugging these back into the expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the innermost operations.
[MIN [MAX 6 6] [MIN 9 4]] simplifies to [MIN 6 4], which equals 4.
[MAX [MIN 4 2] [MAX 0 3]] simplifies to [MAX 2 3], which equals 3.

Then the next operation is [MAX [4] [3]], which equals 4.

The next section is
[SM [MAX [MAX 4 0] [MAX 3 7]] [MIN [SM 5 4] [SM 3 9]]]
We simplify it step-by-step.
[MAX [MAX 4 0] [MAX 3 7]] simplifies to [MAX 4 7], which equals 7.
[MIN [SM 5 4] [SM 3 9]] simplifies to [MIN 9 2], which equals 2.
SM [7 2] = 9

So the first bracket has become [MAX [4] [9]], which equals 9.

On to the second bracket:
[MAX [SM [MIN 9 6] [SM 9 5]] [MIN [MIN 7 6] [SM 1 1]]]
This simplifies as:
[SM [MIN 9 6] [SM 9 5]] -> [SM 6 4] -> 0
[MIN [MIN 7 6] [SM 1 1]] -> [MIN 6 2] -> 2
So it's [MAX [0} [2]], which equals 2.

And the last section of the second bracket is 
[SM [SM [SM 9 8] [MIN 7 2]] [MIN [SM 3 1] [SM 4 6]]].
This simplifies as:
[SM [SM 7 5] 4] -> 6

So the second overall bracket becomes [MAX 2 6], which equals 6.

[MIN [MAX 0 5] [MAX 3 1]] = MIN [(MAX 0 5)=5] [(MAX 3 1)=3] = MIN [5 3] = (MIN [5 3])=3.

Now substitute these back into the original equation:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we resolve the MIN and MAX operations as they are located deepest inside the operation tree.

The MAX between 8 and 0 becomes 8.

The SM between 7 and 8 becomes 5 (as sum modulo 10).

Now, the MIN between 8 and 5 becomes 5.

Next, the MIN between 9 and 3 becomes 3.

The MIN between 4 and 3 becomes 3.

So, the MAX between 5 and 3 becomes 5.

The MAX between 5 and 3 remains 5.

On the other hand, the MAX between 5 and 3 becomes 5.

The MIN between 7 and 9 becomes 7.

So the MIN between 5 and 7 becomes 5.

Next, the MIN between 3 and 2 becomes 2.

The SM between 2 and 2 becomes 4.

So, the MAX between 2 and 4 becomes 4.

Finally, the MAX between 5 and 4 becomes 5. 

This is the result for the first MIN operation.

Next, we resolve the SM operation with the result of the overall MIN operation and the results of the other sub-expressions.

The MIN between 3 and 8 becomes 3.

The MAX between 2 and 4 becomes 4.

So, the SM between 3 and 4 becomes 7.

The SM between 5 and 6 becomes 1.

The MIN between 8 and 3 becomes 3.

So the MIN between 1 and 3 becomes 1.

The overall MIN between 7 and 1 becomes 1.

Next, the MAX between 7 and 0 becomes 7.

The MAX between 8 and 8 remains 8.

So, the MIN between 7 and 8 becomes 7.

The MIN between 2 and 8 becomes 2.

The SM between 7 and 6 becomes 3.

So the MIN between 2 and 3 becomes 2.

The overall SM between 1 and 2 becomes 3.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's break down the expression into smaller parts that can be easily calculated. 
Note that the numbers used in this expression are single-digit integers. 

To do so, we'll replace all:

MAX 6 5 with 6,
MAX 2 8 with 8,
MIN 9 1 with 1,
SM 9 8 with (9+8) mod 10 = 7,
MAX [MIN 8 8] [MIN 7 6] with MAX 8 6 = 8,
MAX 6 3 with 6, 
MAX 0 1 with 1,

MIN 4 1 with 1, 
SM 5 8 with (5+8) mod 10 = 3,
MIN 4 2 with 2, 
MAX 1 1 with 1.

So, we can rewrite our expression as follows:

MAX [MIN [MIN [MIN 6 8] [SM 1 7]] [MIN 8 [MIN 6 1]]] [MIN [MAX [SM 3 3] [MAX 4 4]] [SM [MAX 1 3] [MAX 2 1]]]

Next, simplify the operations:

MIN 6 8 with 6,
SM 1 7 with (1+7) mod 10 = 8,
MIN 8 [MIN 6 1] with MIN 8 1 = 1,
SM 3 3 with (3+3) mod 10 = 6,
MAX 4 4 with 4,
MAX 1 3 with 3,
MAX 2 1 with 2.


Our expression now is much simpler:

MAX [MIN [MIN 6 [SM 8]] 1] [MIN [MAX 6 4] [SM 3 2]].

Keep simplifying:

SM 8 with 8 mod 10 = 8,
MIN 6 8 with 6,
MAX 6 4 with 6,
SM 3 2 with (3+2) mod 10 = 5.

This gives us:

MAX [MIN 6 1] [MIN 6 5].

MIN 6 1 with 1,

MAX [MAX 8 1] [MAX 5 2] = MAX 8 5 = 8
MAX 7 4 = 7
MAX 3 3 = 3

Thus, the given expression simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Step-by-step, the first function to calculate is `[MIN 0 7]`. MIN means we take the smaller value, so the result is 0.
2. Then, we replace it into the expression and get `[SM [MIN 0 [MAX 4 3]] [SM [MIN 2 6] [SM 7 6]]]`. 
3. Let's continue to calculate `[MAX 4 3]`. MAX means we take the larger value, so the result is 4.
4. The expression becomes `[SM [MIN 0 4] [SM [MIN 2 6] [SM 7 6]]]`.
5. Then, `[MIN 0 4]` is calculated which gives us 0, it updates to `[SM 0 [SM [MIN 2 6] [SM 7 6]]]`.
6. Next, `[MIN 2 6]` becomes 2.
7. This turns the expression into `[SM 0 [SM 2 [SM 7 6]]]`.
8. Now, `[SM 7 6]` will be calculated: it is the sum (7 + 6 = 13) modulo 10, so it becomes 3. The expression now reads `[SM 0 [SM 2 3]]`.
9. `[SM 2 3]` becomes (2 + 3 = 5) modulo 10, so 5 `[SM 0 5]`.
10. Finally, `[SM 0 5]` is 5, yielding 5.

We can repeat similar steps to solve the remaining part of the initial expression. 

1. `[MAX [MAX 2 1] [MIN 5 0]]` becomes 2.
2. `[MIN [MAX 2 2] [MAX 2 2]]` also results in 2.
3. After that, `[MIN 2 2]` turns into 2.
4. Moving to `[MAX [MIN [MAX 9 3] [MAX 3 0]] [SM [MIN 9 6] [MIN 8 2]]]`, `[MAX 9 3]` results in 9 and `[MAX 3 0]` is 3, turning `[MIN 9 3]` into 3.
5. At the same time, `[MIN 9 6]` is 6 and `[MIN 8 2]` is 2, so `[SM 6 2]` becomes (6 + 2 = 8) modulo 10 or 8. Eventually, `[MAX 3 8]` leads to 8.

[MAX 2 6] = 6;
[SM 4 2] = 6;
[MIN 3 0] = 0;

Now we again perform the available operations:

[MIN 1 0] = 0;
[MAX 4 6] = 6;
[SM 6 0] = 6;

Let's start solving from the inside of the expression. Solve [SM 6 8], [SM 2 2], [SM 2 9], [SM 2 8] and [SM 2 2].

[SM 6 8] = (6+8) % 10 = 14 % 10 = 4

[SM 2 9] = (2+9) % 10 = 11 % 10 = 1
[SM 2 8] = (2+8) % 10 = 10 % 10 = 0
[SM 1 8] = (1+8) % 10 = 9 % 10 = 9

Step 2: 
Replace these values in the expression and simplify the remaining [MAX] and [MIN]

MIN [MIN [SM [MAX 4 [MIN 1 6]] [MAX [MIN 4 0] [MAX 4 8]]] [MIN [MAX [MIN 0 7] [4]] [MIN [MAX 2 3] [1]]]]

MAX [MAX [MIN [MIN 4 8] [MIN 8 4]] [MIN [0] [4]]] [MIN [SM [MAX 9 1] [MAX 4 6]] [MAX [SM 8 9] [9]]]]

MAX [MAX [MIN [MIN 4 8] [MIN 8 4]] [MIN [0] [4]]] [MIN [SM 9 6] [MAX [SM 8 9] 9]]

Step 4:
Now again calculate [SM 4 8] and [SM 9 6]

[SM 4 8] = (4+8) % 10 = 2

Now calculate [SM 8 9]

[SM 8 9] = (8+9) % 10 = 7

Now replace it:

MIN [MIN 2 8] [MIN 4 [MIN 3 1]]

MAX [MAX [MIN [MIN 4 8] [MIN 8 4]] [MIN [0] [4]]] [MIN 5 [MAX 7 9]]

Step 5:
Now simplify remaining [MIN] expressions and replace:

[SM 6 6] = 2 (as sum modulo 10 results in a sum of 12 but outputs 2 as this is the remainder when divided by 10)

[MAX 8 6] = 8 (as it returns the maximum value)

[MIN 2 1] = 1 (as it returns the minimum value)

[SM 7 1] = 8 (as sum modulo 10 will output a sum of 8)

[MAX 3 3] = 3 (as it returns the maximum value)

[SM 5 9] = 4 (as sum modulo 10 results in a sum of 14 with a remainder of 4)

[MIN 6 4] = 4 (as it returns the minimum value)

[MAX 9 6] = 9 (as it returns the maximum value)

[SM 0 4] = 4 (as sum modulo 10 will output a sum of 4)

[SM 7 3] = 0 (as sum modulo 10 results in a sum of 10 but outputs 0 as this is the remainder when we divide by 10)

[MAX 3 8] = 8 (as it returns the maximum value)

[MIN 1 1] = 1 (as it returns the minimum value)

[SM 0 5] = 5 (as sum modulo 10 will output a sum of 5)

[SM 4 9] = 3 (as sum modulo 10 results in a sum of 13 with a remainder of 3)

[MAX 1 7] = 7 (as it returns the maximum value)

[SM 6 2] = 8 (as sum modulo 10 will output a sum of 8)

Now update the original formula with the above calculated values:

[MAX [SM [SM [SM 0 4] [SM 8 1]] [SM [MIN [SM 5 3] 8]]]

Continue operations:

[MIN 8 1] = 1

[MAX 3 4] = 4

[SM 0 4] = 4

[SM 8 1] = 9

[SM 5 3] = 8

Continue to substitute in the expression:

[SM [MIN 2 4] [MAX 1 4]]
[MAX [SM [SM 4 9] [SM 8 8]]

Perform the MIN, MAX operations:

[MIN 2 4] = 2

[MAX 1 4] = 4

[SM 4 9] = 3

[SM 8 8] = 6

This gives us:
