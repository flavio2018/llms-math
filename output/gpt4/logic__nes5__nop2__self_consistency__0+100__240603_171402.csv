A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, note that ""w|w"" simply equals ""w"", because it says ""w or w""--these are the same, so it's just ""w"". 

Second, any variable or condition OR-ed with True ""variable|T"" is always True, it's the property of OR operation, for example ""w|T"" is always True.

Third, any variable AND-ed with False ""variable&F"" is always False, because one false in an AND condition makes the whole condition False.

Applying these principles, the original formula simplifies as follows:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we should handle the operations that are within the inner parentheses.

The operation !(T & (F | (!T))) then simplifies to !False, which is True.

Next, the operation (T | (F | T)) is equivalent to (True | False | True), and this equals True because the logical ""or"" operation returns True if at least one of its operands is True.

The entire expression now is (True) & ((u | True) | T), which simplifies to u | True on the right side from logical ""and"". Since u can only be True or False, in each case, logical ""or"" with True will return True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify T&F. It's AND logic, so both of the arguments must be True to return True, thus T&F = F.

The formula simplifies to: (F&((((F)|F)&(F|(F&F)))|(F&T)))

Then, the F&F in the formula can be also simplified to F, because as mentioned before, in AND logic both arguments need to be True to return True.

Our formula now is: (F&(((F|F)&(F|F))|(F&T)))

In OR logic, if either of the arguments is True, it returns True. If both are False, it returns False. But we have False (F) OR False (F), which simplifies to False.

So we get: (F&((F&(F))|(F&T)))

Then, F&T is also False because in AND logic both arguments need to be True.

This leads to: (F&(F&F|F))

Here, F&F simplifies to F using the same logic as before. 

So it becomes: (F&(F|F))

Moreover, F|F simplifies to F (False OR False is False).

Therefore, we have (T&(T|F)&(((h&T)|h)|T)) which is (T&(T)&(((h&T)|h)|T)).

Moving to the second part of the bigger formula, we have (((g|F)|T)&F). Since there is ""T"" (True) in the OR ""|"", the result of the formula ((g|F)|T) is True or ""T"". Since ""T"" AND ""F"" (&F) is False or ""F"", the overall result of this formula becomes ""F"" or False.

As before, ORing anything with False gives original value and ANDing anything with True gives the original value:

- `_&T` simplifies to `_`: because AND-ing anything with true results in the original value itself.

Understand that !F equals to T. This implies that we can simplify (!F)|((F|F)&(T|F)) as T|F which is equivalent to T. 

Then, !(T) is equal to F. 

So, !((!F)|((F|F)&(T|F))) simplifies to F. 

That means the initial expression ((o|(o|F))|(!((!F)|((F|F)&(T|F))))) can be simplified down to (o|F)|F, which equals o|F.

Next, we see F|(T|T) operations. As T|T or T OR T is always True, and F OR True is always True, we can simplify to:

(T&((T&(k|(T&T)))&T))

We have T&T operation. We know T&T or T AND T is always True. Applying this operation, we get:

(T&((T&(k|T))&T))

We also have T&k|T operation. As k can be True or False, the result will always be T or True, because T OR F is True. So, we can simplify to:

(T&((T&T)&T))

We once again see more T&T operations. As T&T or T AND T is always True, we can simplify to:

2. Now, we simplify the remaining terms. The logical metarule states that anything 'and' with False (F) gives False. Hence, (F&f) becomes F. Also, anything 'and' with True (T) is equal to itself. Hence, (f&T) simplifies to f. Our formula now simplifies to ((f&(f&F))|(f&f)).

3. Again, using the logical metarules, (f&F) becomes F. So, our formula now simplifies to ((f&F)|f).

4. Simplifying further, (f&F) becomes F. Our formula now simplifies to (F|f).

That gives us '(((e&T)&T)|e)&(!(m|T))'.

'e&T' equals 'e', and '(e&T)&T' becomes 'e&T' which equals to 'e', since 'and' needs both inputs to be true to output true.

'!T' equals to 'F', because 'not' connector outputs the opposite of the input.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, start from the deepest parentheses.
1. (F|F) simplifies to F (since F or F is still False)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","We start from the deepest brackets and then expand our way out. 

Step 1: T & F = False
So, the statement now looks like: !((T&(F|False))&(!(T&True)))

Step 2: T & True = True
So, the statement now looks like: !((T&(F|False))&(!True))

Step 3: !True = False
So, the statement now begins to look like: !((T&F)&False)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. In the logical expression F&F, it always results to F.
2. T|F simplifies to T.
3. l&T simplifies to l due to the identity law.
4. l|l simplifies to l due to the idempotent law.
5. d&F simplifies to F because anything ANDed with False results in False.

((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression is T &(T &(o & (T & F))) | (k & ((T &(F & F)) | F)), where the symbols:

& = logical ""and"".
| = logical ""or"".
! = logical ""not"".
T = True.
F = False.

Anything AND false is false. So (T & F) and (F & F) both result in false.
Therefore, the first part of the expression (T &(T &(o & False))) becomes T & T & o & False, which is false.

The same goes for the second part (k & ((T & False) | F)), where the part inside the brackets becomes false, which makes the whole part false as well (because k & False = false).

Therefore the whole expression simplifies to False or False which is False. So the simplified logic formula of ((T&(T &(o &(T & F)))) | (k & ((T &(F & F)) | F))) is F.",F,F

((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","We'll use the following principles of logic:
- P & F = F (Anything ""and"" False is False)
- P | F = P (Anything ""or"" False is the same thing)
- P & T = P (Anything ""and"" True is the same thing)
- P | T = T (Anything ""or"" True is True)

Let's simplify the formula:

((f | (F & ((a & F) & F))) | (f | ((F | (h & F)) & T)))

First, simplify ((a & F) & F) into (F & F) as per rule P & F = F which equals to F

((f | (F & F)) | (f | ((F | (h & F)) & T)))

Next, simplify (F & F) into F

((f | F) | (f | ((F | (h & F)) & T)))

Next, simplify (f | F) into f because P | F = P

(f | (f | ((F | (h & F)) & T)))

Next, simplify (h & F) into F

(f | (f | ((F | F) & T)))

Next, simplify (F | F) into F

(f | (f | (F & T)))

Next, simplify (F & T) into F

(f | (f | F))

Finally, simplify (f | F) into f because P | F = P and simplify (f | f) into f because P | P = P

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, (!(!T)) simplifies to T (not of not true is true).

Secondly, (F|(F|F))) simplifies to F (false or false and false is false).

Then, ((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F))) simplifies to b (both b and True OR b simplifies to b).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first thing we can note is that F|F is False since False or False results in False. We also know that !T is False since it's the negation of the Truth. So the formula becomes: 

(False|((False&False)|T)|False). 

Furthermore, False&False is False, so the formula updates to:

(False|(False|T)|False), 

or equivalently 

(False|T|False). 

Finally, False or Truth is always True. So the answer to this problem is:
