A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we'll simplify some of the constants and redundant parts. ""F&T"" is false because false AND anything is always false. ""T&T"" is true because true AND true is true. 

""F&F"" is always false. So ""!F&F"" is not false which is true. 

""j|j"" is just j because anything OR with itself is itself. 

Finally, ""!(!T)"" is the same as true because it's a double negation. Now we substitute these in the formula. 

So the formula becomes: 

(i|(i|F) & !(F|(T&(!u&j))&T))

We can simplify this further. 

""i|F"" is just i because anything OR with false is itself. ""T&(!u&j))&T"" is just ""(!u&j)"" because anything AND with true is itself. 

So the formula simplifies to: 

(i|i) & !(F|(!u&j))

""i|i"" is just i. Also, ""F|(!u&j)"" basically means that if either ""u is false and j is true"" or it is false, then it is true. Otherwise, it is false. The negation flips this condition. 

So the formula further simplifies to: 

i & !(F|(!u&j))

This is the simplest form of the original logic formula. It means that if i is true and neither is it false, nor are both u is false and j is true, then the formula is true. Otherwise, it is false.",i & !(F|(!u&j)),i

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First let's simplify some of the expressions according to their fundamental logic rules.

""x & x"" is simply equal to ""x"".
""X | x"" equals to ""x"".
""F & (!((F&T)&T))"". Here inner expression evaluates to ""F & F"" which is ""F"". Thus, whole expression is ""F"" which equals to ""F"".
""F & T"" is ""F"", and ""F & T"" is again ""F"".
""c & c"" gives is ""c"". ""c | c"" gives ""c"".

After these simplifications, logic expression would look like follow :

((x & x & x)|T),

((x & x)| T),

- F|F evaluates to False (F).
- F&T evaluates to False (F).
- !F evaluates to True (T).
- c&T simplifies to c, since c AND True is just c.

Subbing in for these in the expression, we have !((T|T|T|(c|f|T)&T)&F). 

Next, simplify the OR operations:

- T|T|T|(c|f|T) results in T, since OR'ing with True results in True.
- This makes the entire expression !(T&T) & F, which further simplifies to !T & F.

Finally, NOT of True is False (F), making the expression F & F, which will always be False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the logical AND of any value with True (T&True) will give us the original value. Therefore, we can simplify parts of the expression using this rule:

(T|(T&(T|T)))

Becomes:

(T|(T&T))

Since (val&True) = val, this further simplifies to T.

The second part of the expression is ((T&(T&((!((!(!(!(F&F))))&(!(T&(!(j&F))))))|(!(t|T))))).

Firstly, F&F = F. Thus, !F&F = !F. We know that the logical NOT of any value equals its opposite, hence !F = T.

Therefore,  ((T&(T&((!((!(!(!(F&F))))&(!(T&(!(j&F))))))|(!(t|T)))))) 

Becomes: 

((T&(T&((!((!(!T))&(!(T&(!j))))))|(!(t|T))))).

Then, we can use the simplification rule for the logical AND that was mentioned earlier to further simplify this expression to:

((T&(T&((!((!T))&(!j))|(!t))).

Again, with the rule of logical AND, the expression simplifies further to:

((T&T&((!F&!j)|!t))).

The second part of the expression now simply becomes 

(T&((T&!j)|!t)) which further simplifies to ((T|!j)|!t) since T and anything gives the anything itself.

The whole formula from the start becomes: T&((T|!j)|!t) which further simplifies to (T|!j)|!t which simplifies again to T|!t because T OR anything will always equal True.

For the final step, since !t OR True will always be true regardless of t's value, the whole simplified expression is just True (T).",T,T

(F&(p&(F|F))) simplifies to F, because False AND anything is always False based on the properties of logical AND.

- `F | F` results in `F`
- `g & T` or `g & g` results in `g` because when you perform 'and' operation with True or the same value, result stays same.
- `g | F` also yields `g`, because the `Or` operation with `False` doesn't change the result.
- `T | F` results in `T`, due to the principle of logical 'or' operations: if at least one of them is `True`, the result will be `True`.

Inserting these results back into the overall formula:

`((d & (h | (q | (g | T)))) | (T & F)) & T`

Continue simplifying:

- `g | T` results in `T`, because the `Or` operation with `True` results in `True`.
- `T & F` yields `F`, because in `And` operation, having `False` will definitely make the result `False`.

So, the formula is now:

`(d & (h | (q | T))) & T`

Further simplification: 

- `(q | T)` yields `T`, because the `Or` operation with `True` results `True`.

So,

`(d & (h | T)) & T`

Continue simplification:

- `(h | T)` yields `T`.

Your formula simplifies to:

`(d & T) & T`

Further simplification:

- `d & T` results in `d`.

First, get rid of F inside the formula since any variable AND F equals F and any variable OR F equals the variable. Similarly, get rid of all the double negatives.

This gives us:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Let's simplify innermost operations first - ""$(F&F)$"" and ""$(F&T)$"". As ""and"" operation with False gives False, these operations will become ""F"".

2. In the operations ""$(T&F)$"" and ""$(F&F)$"", the presence of a ""False"" evaluates them to ""False"". This simplifies the expression to

    ""(((((T|(F|(F|F)))|((F|T))))&T)|(!(T|(T|(!T)))))&F)&((F|T))"".

3. The operations ""$(F|F)$"" and ""$(T|(T|(!T)))$"" bring out the nature of ""or"". The expression simplifies to:

   ""(((((T|F)|((F|T))))&T)|(!T))&F)&T"" = ""(((T|((F|T)))&T)|(!T))&F&T"".

4. The expression ""$(F|T)$"" translates into ""T"", regardless of whether ""F"" or ""T"" is true. This changes the expression to:

   ""((T&T)|(!T))&F&T"" = ""(T|!T)&F&T"".

5. Now, within the braces ""$(T|!T)$"" we have a situation where one is the negation of the other. Therefore, the outcome here is ""T"". This simplifies the expression to:

After applying these rules, the formula simplifies to:

The term (!(k&F)) simplifies to T (NOT ""K and False"" is always True).

The term (F&F) simplifies to F (or ""False AND False"" is always False). 
Then, (T&T) i.e. ""True AND True"", simplifies to T (True).
Following that, (!T&F) simplifies to F (""NOT True AND False"" is always False).
Then, (!F|F) simplifies to T (""NOT False OR False"" is always True).

Now, we have two logical formulas with T values: (!(T&F)) = T and ((!T|F)& T) = T.

-> (((a|(a&((a&T)&(T|(((d&d)|F)|(T&(b|T))))))&a)|a)&(a&(a&!(F|F))))

2. &(T) and |(T) do not change the value of the statements they are applied to. So we can simplify further:

3. Since d&d is always equal to d and !F is always T, we can simplify to:

5. Since (a|a) is always equal to a, our final simplified logical formula is:

3. Now let's look at the sequence (((j&T)&(((o|F)|(T&F))|F)|(T|(v|T))))&j. We've already simplified o|F to o and T&F to F, so this sequence becomes ((j&T)&(((o)|F)|F)|(T|(v|T))))&j, which simplifies further to ((j&T)&(o)|(T|(v|T)))&j.

- `T & T` simplifies to `T`.
- `T | F` simplifies to `T`.
- `F & F` simplifies to `F`.
- `F | F` simplifies to `F`.

This will simplify our expression a little bit:

`((i & ((h & F) & (((T | F) | (T & T)) & F) | (T | F))) & F) & (T & F)`.

Next, you should note that `X & F` simplifies to `F` regardless of the value of `X`, because false and anything will always be false. Similarly, `T | X` simplifies to `T` for any `X`, because true or anything will always be true.

This will simplify our expression a lot more:

    (!F & ((!F) | (z & (((T & (F | F) | (F & F)) | (!(F | T))) & (T | T))) | (T & (F | F)))) | (!T).

2. We know that the result of the operation ""F or F"" and ""F and F"" is always F, ""F or T"" is always T, ""T and T"" is always T, ""not F"" is always T, and ""not T"" is always F. So we can simplify it to:
    (T & (T | (z & (((T & F) | F) | T) & T))) | F.

3. In the subpart (T & (T | anything)), the ""T & T"" will always result in T, and ""T or anything"" will always result in T. As a result, the full formula simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We can start by simplifying the equation in several steps. First, we can simplify ""F&T"" and ""(b&F)|F"" because anything AND with False results in False and anything OR with False results nothing changes, so we get:
   (b & (r & (r & (!F))) | (T & (T & (!F)))) & (T | (!F)) | (b & T) | (b & b)

2. Then we can simplify ""!F"" which means NOT False, i.e., True, as well as ""T&(T&(!F))"" which equals true AND true AND true = true. So we get:
   (b & (r & (r & T)) | T) & (T | T) | (b & T) | (b & b)

3. Then we can simplify ""(r & (r & T))"" which is basically r AND r AND true = r, and then ""(b & b)"" which is b, and ""(T | T)"" which is T. So the final simplified logic formula will look as below:
   (b & r | T) & T | (b & T) | b

4. In the expression ""b & r | T"", since anything OR with true results in True, i.e., T, and then ""(b & T)"" equals to b, so we can write it like this:
   T & T | b | b

5. And finally, it simplifies to:

(T&T&T) = T, because ""and"" of the same values just results in the same value
(x&x) = x, because ""and"" of the same values just results in the same value
(x&F) = F, because ""and"" with a false value will lead to false

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to deal with negations (!).
!T = F
!(v|T) = ? (Considering that any value or True is always True, the reverse of it will be False)

w&((w|w)&T) = w&W = w 
T&(F&(r|T)) = T&F = F 
F&F = F 

Therefore, we can simplify ((((w&((w|w)&T))&T)|((T&(F&(r|T)))|F))|(F&F)) as w|F|F which gives us w.

Then we can substitute these values back into the original expression:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Since T | F is always true, replace it with T.

The formula then becomes ((T)|((((p&((j&(T|(f&(!T))))|(T|(!(!(F&T))))))&F)|T)|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))).

2) Notice that f&(!T) will always be false, replace it with F.
   
The formula then becomes ((T)|((((p&((j&(T|F))|(T|(!(!(F&T))))))&F)|T)|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))).

3) True or any statement will always be True, replace (T|F) with T. 

The formula then becomes ((T)|((((p&((j&T)|(T|(!(!(F&T))))))&F)|T)|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))).

4) Same as previous, replace (T|(!(!(F&T)))) with T. 

The formula then becomes ((T)|((((p&(j&T))&F)|T)|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))).

5) Double negation of a statement will be the statement itself. So, replace (!(!(F&T))) with (F&T).

The formula then becomes ((T)|((((p&(j&T))&F)|T)|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))).

6) Since any statement and False will always be False, replace (p&(j&T))&F with F.

The formula then becomes ((T)|((F|T)|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))).

7) Again any statement or True will always be True, replace (F|T) with T.

The formula then becomes ((T)|(T|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))).

8) Similarly, False and any statement will always be False. So, replace (F&T) with F.

The formula then becomes ((T)|(T|(!((F&T)&T)))).

9) Update the statement after replacing (F&T) with F, the statement now will be ((T)|(T|(!(F&T)))).

10) Update the statement by replacing (F&T) with F, it becomes ((T)|(T|(!F))).

11) Finally, negation of False is True. So replace !F with T.

3. (((T|F)|(!(w|(!((!T))|F)))))&T)&(F|(u&F)) simplifies to T since T|F is always T.

4. Now, Let's simplify (!(w|(!((!T))|F))), we know that ((!(w|(!T|F)))) is ((!(w|T)) since !T is F and F|F is F and again T|anyting is always T so (!(w|T)) is !T and !T is always F so, ((!(w|(!((!T))|F)))) simplifies to F.

5. Now, the whole expression becomes ((T & T) & (F|(u&F))), and T & T is always T so it simplifies to (T & (F|(u&F))).

6. Let's simplify (F|(u&F)), we know that u&F is always F since anything & F is always F. so, it simplifies to F|F and F|F is always F.

    a. ((T&T)&F) is equivalent to (T&F) which is False or 'F'.
    b. (!(T&T)) is the negation of True, which is False or 'F'. 
So, this part (((T&T)&F)|(!(T&T))) simplifies to (F|F), which is 'F'.

This leads to our expression becoming (F&(T|(!F))) equal to (F&(T|T)) which is 'F'.

3. ((w&(T|(!F)))|T):
    a. (T|(!F)) is equivalent to (T|T) which is True or 'T'.

2. In addition, we also know that the negation of False is True (!F = T) and the negation of True is False (!T = F).

3. We also know that T&F = F and F|T = T.

   Let's start to apply these rules to simplify the expression.

- F|T = T
- T|F = T
- !(T&F) = !(F) = T
- F&(T|(T&F)) = F&T = F

- T|F = T

Further simplifying using T OR anything (T|anything) is T. Similarly, F AND anything (F&anything) is F, we get:

- X and True = X
- X and False = False
- X or False = X
- X or True = True
- not True = False, and not False = True
- Any variable 'V' OR with True is always True ( i.e., V | T = T)
- Any variable 'V' OR with False retains its original value (i.e., V | F = V)
- Any variable 'V' AND with True retains its original value (i.e., V & T = V)
- Any variable 'V' AND with False is always False (i.e., V & F = F)

Applying these rules to given formula, let's start:

1. Simplify this part: F & ((p | T) & F). Since 'V' OR with True is always True, it becomes: F & (T & F), then F & F (as 'V' AND with False is always False). It leads to False (because 'V' AND with False is always False).

2. Now it becomes ((((h & h) & T) | ((((h | False) | (F & ((F & (F | F)) & T))) & (h & h)) | (F & F))) | (h & h)).

3. Again, simplifying (F & (F & (F | F)) & T), applying 'V' OR with False retains its original value. It simplifies to (F & F & T). Which simplifies to F (as 'V' AND with False is always False).

4. Now it becomes ((((h & h) & T) | ((((h | False) | F) & (h & h)) | F)) | (h & h)).

5. Simplicity this parts 'h | False' leads to h, 'F & (h & h)' leads to F and 'F | F' leads to F.

6. Hence, the complete formula simplifies to ((((h & h) & T) | (h & F)) | (h & h)), which again simplifies to ((h & T) | F) | h, as 'V' AND with himself equals V.

7. Simplifying further yields (h | F) | h, as 'V' AND with True retains its original value.

8. Eventually, it simplifies to h | h, as 'V' OR with False retains its original value.

Which returns to h, because 'V' OR with himself equals V. Hence, the simplified logic formula is h.",h,h

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) First of all, remove the logical operations involving T and F from the innermost parentheses. As per the logical operations:
   - T | F, F | T, T | F | ..., F | T | ..., n | T and T | n equals T for all n.

   - n & T, T & n, v & T and T & v equal n and v respectively (in this case, n and v).
   - v & (T|F) equals v.
   - T & F and F & T equals F.
   - F | n and n | F equal n.
   - !(!F) equals T.

So, the formula converts to: ((n|T)|(F&T)&(F|F))&T|T, that is equal to (T|F)&F|T, which is T&F|T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Observe that the expression (F & F) always equals F, regardless of the truth values of operands.
2. (F & T) always equals F, given the semantics of logical and.
3. (A | T) This is essentially saying ""A or True"". This will always simply evaluate to True, regardless of what A is.
4. (!T) or (!F) becomes False or True respectively, according to the semantics of logical not.
5. Now, observe that (A & B & ... & F) where one of the statements is false, the whole statement equals F. It means, regardless of the value(s) for the others, if there's at least one False, the result is False.

Applying these simplifications to your expression:

1. (F | T) = T
2. (F & T) = F
3. (A | T) = T
4. (!T) = F, (!F) = T
5. (x & (T | (F & F) | T) = (x & T | F |T) = (x & T) = x

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Regardless of any logical expression, if it is & (and) with T (true), the result doesn't change. So, wherever &T appears, we can simplify it by removing &T.
2. A logical expression | (or) with T (true) will always result in T (true), so we can simplify the expression by transforming it to T when |T appears.
3. (F&F) gives F (false). So, F&F can be replaced by F.
4. !F is always T (true), so it can be replaced by T.
5. !T is always F (false) so wherever it appears, it can be replaced by F.
6. any logical expression & (and) with F gives F, and | (or) with T leaves T.

Following the above rules, let's simplify the expression step by step.

The original expression:

3. T | T = T, so ((p | p) & ((p & T) & T)) simplifies to ((p | p) & (p & T)).
4. something & T = something, so ((p|p) & (p & T)) simplifies to ((p|p) & p), which equals to p.

Step 1: Simplify innermost expressions:
!T = F (not True is False)
T&F = F (True and False is False)
F&F = F (False and False is False)
F | F = F (False or False is still False)

Replace these in the equation:

Step 2: Continue simplifying:
F&f = F (False and any value is False)

w&F = F
o | F = o (any value or False is the original value)

Replace these in the equation:

Step 5: Continue simplifying:
o | F = o

But this doesn't seem to look right. Therefore, we might've made an error in the early steps.

Let's revise the logic: ""F"" is the neutral element for the logical or, ""T"" is the neutral element for the logical and, that means wherever we see something being an ""and"" with False or an ""or"" with True, we can drop the “and” or ""or"".

Thus, simplifying the formula, starting from the innermost brackets, gives:

1. ((F|F)|F) simplifies to F (False or False or False equals False)

2. (T&F) simplifies to F (True and False equals False)

3. (F|(F&F)) = (F|F) = F

4. Replace these terms in the original logic formula: 

((o|(o|((F&F)|(w&F)))|F))|(((((f&T)&f)|T)|T)&F)&(!T)

After simplifying all clauses that are ""or"" with F and ""and"" with F we get:

Then:

(o|o|F) = o

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. | is the OR operator; if any of the operands is TRUE, the result is TRUE. So, T | F | F will simplify to T.

2. So, the expression now becomes: (c | T) & (T & F) & F.

3. c | T will simplify to T, because OR with True always results in True.

4. Similarly, T & F will simplify to F, as AND operation with False always results in False.

5. So, the expression now reduces to T & F & F.

6. Using the AND property, we can further reduce this to F, because AND with False always results in False.

So, the simplified form of given formula is F.",F,F

(!((y|T)|((x|(!(((T|((g|F)&(!T)))&(F&(F&T)))&(t&F))))&(T|(t&(F&T)))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify expressions involving T and F:
- (g|F) evaluates to g since any value or False becomes the value itself.
- (!T) evaluates to F since the logical inversion of True is False. 
- (F&T) always evaluates to F as False and any value is always False.
- (T|anything) always evaluates to T because True or any value is always True.
- (anything&F) always evaluates to F because any value and False is always False. 

After this initial simplification, the expression is:
!(y|T|((x|(T&F))&T)).

Applying again the simplification rules:
- (y|T) simplifies to T since y or True is always True.
- (T&F) simplifies to F since True and False is always False.
- (x|F) simplifies to x since x or False is just x. 
- (x&T) simplifies to x since x and True is just x.

So we simplify the expression to:
!((T|F)&T).

Again applying simplification rules:
- (T|F) simplifies to T since True or False is always True. 
- (T&T) simplifies to T since True and True is True.

Finally, we end up with logical not of True i.e.:
!T.

As earlier stated, logical not of True is False. Hence, the answer is F.",F,F

(((((((((j&j)|((j&T)&(T|T)))|j)&j)&(F|(!(F&F))))&(!F))&(j&j))&F)&(F|(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we simplify the constants:

j & j equals to j (same elements connected by & operator remains the same)

T & T equals to T (True & True is always True)

F & F equals to F (False & False is always False)

!F equals to T (Negation of False is True)

!T equals to F (Negation of True is False)

Using these simplifications we get:

(((((((((j&j)|((j&T)&T))|j)&j)&(F|T))&T)&(j&j))&F)&(F|F)) which equals to:

((((((((j|((j&T)&T))|j)&j)&(F|T))&T)&(j&j))&F)&F)

We then continue to simpify:

j&T = j (as anything with True remains the same)

This gives us ((((j|j)|j)&(F|T))&T)&(j&j)&F)&F)) which equals to (j&T&j&F)&F 

As False and any other value gives False, we can simplify it to F (False).",F,F
