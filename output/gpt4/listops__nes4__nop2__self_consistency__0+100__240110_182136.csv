[MAX [SM 1 [SM 6]] [MIN [SM [MAX 4 4] [MIN 8 2]] [SM [MAX 4 1] [MAX 5 6]]]]
Secondly, we calculate the new values insides the square brackets:

SM 1 6 = (1 + 6) mod 10 = 7 mod 10 = 7

MAX 4 4 = 4
MIN 8 2 = 2
SM 4 2 = (4 + 2) mod 10 = 6 mod 10 = 6

MAX 4 1 = 4
MAX 5 6 = 6
SM 4 6 = (4 + 6) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0

This gives us:
[MAX [7] [MIN [6] [0]]]

Finally, we calculate the last values:

MIN 6 0 = min(6, 0) = 0
MAX 7 0 = max(7, 0) = 7

So, the result of the operation is 7.",7,0

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[MIN [SM [MAX [MIN 6 6] [MIN 0 8]] [MAX [MAX 7 6] [SM 1 1]]] [SM [MIN [MAX 5 4] [MIN 1 1]] [SM [SM 1 2] [MIN 1 1]]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, start looking inside the deepest levels of brackets. MIN 6 6 is 6, MIN 0 8 is 0, MAX 7 6 is 7 and SM 1 1 is 2.
2. Replacing these in the original expression we get [MIN [SM [MAX 6 0] [MAX 7 2]] [SM [MIN [MAX 5 4] [MIN 1 1]] [SM [SM 1 2] [MIN 1 1]]]].
3. In the next nested brackets, MAX 6 0 is 6, MAX 5 4 is 5, MIN 1 1 is 1 and SM 1 2 is 3.
4. Replace these in the expression to get [MIN [SM 6 [MAX 7 2]] [SM [MIN 5 1] [SM 3 [MIN 1 1]]]].
5. Solving the next layer, MAX 7 2 is 7, MIN 5 1 is 1, SM 3 1 is 4.
6. Replace these, to get [MIN [SM 6 7] [SM 1 4]].
7. Then we calculate SM 6 7 as 3 (since sum modulo 10 of 13 is 3) and SM 1 4 as 5.
8. The final step is calculating MIN 3 5 which is 3. 

So the original expression evaluates to 3.",3,3

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[MAX [MIN [MIN [MIN 3 0] [SM 1 5]] [MAX [MIN 3 4] [MAX 6 7]]] [MIN [MAX [MAX 1 0] [MIN 4 6]] [MAX [MAX 5 7] [SM 8 3]]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we solve the innermost brackets:

[MIN 3 0] = 0
[SM 1 5] = (1+5)%10 = 6
[MIN 3 4] = 3
[MAX 6 7] = 7
[MAX 1 0] = 1
[MIN 4 6] = 4
[MAX 5 7] = 7
[SM 8 3] = (8+3)%10 = 1

Replacing these into the initial equation, we get:

[MAX [MIN [MIN 0 6] [MAX 3 7]] [MIN [MAX 1 4] [MAX 7 1]]]

Then, we solve again:

[MIN 0 6] = 0
[MAX 3 7] = 7
[MAX 1 4] = 4
[MAX 7 1] = 7

The equation becomes:

[MAX [MIN 0 7] [MIN 4 7]]

We solve it again:

[MIN 0 7] = 0
[MIN 4 7] = 4

Ultimately, we have:

[MAX 0 4] = 4

So the solution is 4.",4,4
