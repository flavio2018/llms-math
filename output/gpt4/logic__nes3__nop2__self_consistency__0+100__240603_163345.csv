Then, (False|True) using or operation on False and True, we get True.
This leaves us with: (True|False).

Finally (True|False) using or operation on True and False, we get True. 

So the formula simplifies to T (True).",T,T
94,logic,self_consistency,((c|F)|((c|F)&(T&T))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
((c|F)|((c|F)&(T&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify inside of the brackets. Logical operation T&T yields True, therefore:

((c|F)|((c|F)&T)).

Next, we know that any value OR False is the value itself. So, c|F becomes c. The equation simplifies to:

(c|(c&T)).

Additionally, since any value AND True is the value itself, c&T becomes c. So, we get:

(c|c).

Finally, we know that any value OR itself is just the value. Therefore, the fully simplified logic formula is:

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
((y|(y|y))&(y|(y&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression (y|y) is the same as y. This is because, in logical OR operation, if any of the operands is true, the result is true. Hence, if y is true, the result is true. If y is false, the result is false. So, we can simplify the expression (y|y) as y.

Now the expression simplifies to ((y|y)&(y|(y&T))). Simplified further, the result is (y&(y|(y&T))).

Now, consider the expression (y|(y&T)). If y is true, the result is true irrespective of the second operand, i.e., (y&T) because of the OR operation. So, we can further simplify the expression as y. 

So, the final result is (y&y) which is simply y.",y,y

((i&(T&T))&((i&T)&i)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula can be simplified as follows:

First, simplify (T & T) to T because it's True that True AND True is True.
So, ((i&(T&T))&((i&T)&i)) becomes ((i&T)&((i&T)&i)).

Then, 'i & T' and '(i&T)&i' can be simplified to 'i' and 'i&i' because it's always True that any value AND True is equal to that value.
So, ((i&T)&((i&T)&i)) becomes (i & i). 

Finally, the 'i & i' can be simplified to 'i'. So the final simplified form is 'i'.",i,i

(((c&c)|T)&(l&(T&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression simplifies as follows:

First, look at the (c&c) on the left. This is just equal to c since '&'' is a logical AND operation and a value AND'd with itself will just be itself.

Then we have that expression OR'd with T (True). Logically, anything OR'd with True will always be True. So, ((c&c)|T) simplifies to just T.

Next, look at the (T&F) on the right. This is equal to F since the '&'' operation logically ANDs T (True) and F (False), resulting in False.

So, we then have l & F, which is always equal to F, because any value AND'd with False is always False.

Puting it together, (T&F) simplifies to just F because T AND'd with F is False.

So, in conclusion, the entire expression simplifies to just F.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","In logical terms:

- An expression ""q&q"" is just ""q"" because both the literals are the same. 
- An expression ""q|q"" simplifies to ""q"" again, because it's saying ""q OR q"" which is simply ""q"". 
- ""q|F"" simplifies to ""q"", because ""q OR False"" is always ""q"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the logic negation operator, !, applied to False value (F), i.e., !F, yields True. 
So the expression simplifies to: (T&T) & (o|(T&T)).

Now, the expression ((T&T)) simplifies to T, since it's stating true AND true, which is true.
So, the expression becomes: T & (o|T).

Finally, since any logic literal OR a true value results in true (o|T = T), the expression completely simplifies to:

T & T,
