(T&T) = T (True and True is True)
(F|(!T)) = F (False or False is False)

2. Likewise, any value logically ORed with True is always True (V | T = T). Hence, the (e|T) simplifies to True, and !T & (T | T) simplifies to F. As a result, we can simplify (!((!T)&(T|T))) to T.

Substituting these results back into the original formula:

1. Anything logically ANDed with True is the value itself (V & T = V). Hence, (d&(T&T)&T) simplifies to d.

3. Any logical disjunction (logical or) with True is always True. Therefore, the entire expression ((((F&F)|F)&F)|T) simplifies to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First of all, the ""not"" operation (!) inverts the truth value. Therefore, !T signifies F (False) and !F yields T (True). Also, an operation T|ANYTHING yields T, and an operation F|ANYTHING yields ANYTHING. The same logic applies for &. And F&'ANYTHING' results in F.

2. From the innermost parenthesis, T|(T&(!(!(t&F)))) simplifies as T|(T&t) = T|t (True or t) which then equals T (True) because an ""or"" operation with True on one side always results in True.

3. So, F|((T|F)) in the next parenthesis is also F|T=F (False or True), which then equals T (True).

4. Hence, !(T|F) is !(T) or !F (!True or not False) = F or T = T.

5. So, ((F|(!(T|(F|T|F)))) becomes F|!T=F (False or not True) = F, because inverted True is False, and False or False is equal to False.

6. Let's look at the second part of the expression now, (F|(T&(((F&(F|((w|F)|(!T)))&F))|T)&F))). 

7. Starting with the innermost brackets we get (w|F)|(!T) = w or !T.

8. (F|(w|F)|(!T))) simplifies to F|(w or F or F) = w or T (we know !T = F).

9. (((F|(w|F)|(!T)))&F)) equals (w or T) and F = F, Any logical ""and"" operation with False results in False.

10. The next operand, T&F = F. 

11. (F|F) equals F. 

12. !F = T. so Part1 `F|T = T` and Part2 `F|F=T`, thus the whole operation simplifies to T which then equals True.

2. We simplify this part: (F|(F|T)) = (F|T) = T.
3. We know from Boolean logic that &T and |T have different impacts on an expression as they respectively don't change and conserve the expression. Thus, the first part simplifies to: t & t = t (since t & T = t and t & t = t).
4. The expression ((T|F)|F)&T)&F simplifies to T & T & F = F.
5. In the second part of the formula, we see expressions like (d | T) and ((d | T) ... | F). Because |T creates a result of T no matter what d is and |F does not change the expression, this section simplifies to d & !T = d & F = F.
6. The &T at the end of the first part also has no effect because if the preceding statement resolves to false, &T will not change it; if it resolves to true, &T will still yield true.

2. Not operation (!) of any boolean value negates the value. Therefore, (!F) is T and (!T) is F. 

3. An important note is that (var | var) is equivalent to var (similarly, (var & var) = var), and (T | anything) = T (similarly, (F & anything) = F). 

4. Finally, logical or operation (|) of any variable or proposition with True (T) always yield True. Therefore, (anything | T) is always T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we notice that (T|F), (T|T), (F|(T|(T&F))) and (F|T) all simplify to T because the or operation (|) with T and any value gives T.

So, we can simplify ((T|F)|((T|T)&(T|F)))&F and (F|(T|(T&F))) to T & F and T, respectively. Since any value anded (&) with F gives F, T & F simplifies to F.

So, our formula now becomes:

((t|(((i&T)&(!F))|T)|T)|T)&((T&((T&T)&T))&T)

In the same manner, the & operation with any value and T simplifies to that value itself, so we can remove the instances of T in (i&T), (T&((T&T)&T)) and ((T&((T&T)&T))&T) to obtain:

(t|((i&(!F))|T)|T)&T

The logical not (!) of F is T, so (i&(!F)) turns into i & T, which simplifies to i.

Thus, our formula reduces to:

(t|(i|T)|T)&T

Continuing with the same principle, (i|T) and (t|(i|T)|T) both simplify to T. Therefore, our final simplified formula is:

T & T,

2. Anything OR with False results in the original value.
3. Not False results in True.

Now, let's start simplification.

((F&(FALSE&T))&(T|(F|((n|F)&F)))).  
Here, F&(p&F) results in False. Anything AND with False is False. So, (F&FALSE&T) is equal to False.

Also, (n|F) results in n. (n&F) results in False. Anything OR with False maintains the original value, so (F|FALSE) is equal to F and (b|T) is equal to True. (True&(!F)) is equal to True. That makes the second part (T|(F|(FALSE))), which simplifies as (T|F) i.e., True.

Therefore, the complete logic formula simplifies as (False&True) which is equals to False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, anything OR T (A|T) directly simplifies to T. This is because no matter what A is (either T or F), the overall expression will always be true. 

Secondly, anything AND F (A&F) also simplifies to F, because no matter what A is (either T or F), the overall expression will always be false.

Also, anything OR F (A|F) simplifies to A, because the value of the expression goes as the value of A.

Lastly, anything AND T (A&T) simplifies to A, as here, the value of the expression goes as the value of A.

Using these basic principles of logic simplification, let's simplify the given expression:

((T&(!(((((F&T)|F)|T)&(((((F&(T|(F|T)))&F)&((g|((c|T)|T))&T))&F)|F))&(!T))))&((n|(T|F))|T)).

The expression (((F&T)|F)|T) simplifies as follows:
(((F&T)|F)|T)
=> ((F|F)|T)
=> (F|T)
=> T

Then the expression (((((F&(T|(F|T)))&F)&((g|((c|T)|T))&T))&F)|F):
=> (((((F&F)&F)&((g&((c|T)&T))&F))&F)|F) 
=> ((((F&F)&F)&((g&(T&T))&F))&F)|F)
=> ((((F&F)&((g&T)&F))&F)|F)
=> (((F&(F&F))&F)|F)
=> ((F&F)&F)|F
=> F|F
=> F

Then the whole following sub-expression resolves to F
(!(((((F&T)|F)|T)&(((((F&(T|(F|T)))&F)&((g|((c|T)|T))&T))&F)|F))
=> (!((T&F)&F))
=> (!F)
=> T

And in addition, (!T) also = F.

So, the whole above expression simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Logical OR (|) with F means the output will be given by the other operand since False has no effect when used with OR. Logical AND (&) with T means the output will be given by the other operand since True has no effect when used with AND. Logical NOT (!) on F changes it into T and vice versa. So, let's start simplifying this formula:

   (((((c&(T&(!((f|(!(w|(F|T))))&F))))&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&(!(!(!(((z|F)&T)&F)))))))|F))|(!F))
   
   This leads us to:
   
   (((((c&(T&(!(f&F))))&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&(!(!(!((z&T)&F)))))))|F))|T)
   
2. In the above expresion f&F will be F, ((z&F)&T) will be F, and the whole !(f&F) will be T and !((z&F)&T) will be T:

    (((((c&T)&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&(!(!(!F))))))|F))|T)
    
3. Now considering the simplification rules for logical operations: !(!(!F)) will be F:

    ((((c&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&F)))|F))|T)

4. Further simplification gives:

    ((c|F)|((c|(c&F))|F))|T) 

5. Now c with AND operation on itself is c. Also OR operation with F doesn't change the output. Thus,

Another important point is that anything & True equals the original truth value. So, (a&T) equals a and (v&v) equals v.

- The logical and of True and False is False. Hence, T&F simplifies to F and its not is True.

- The logical not of False is True, so !F = T.

Step 1: T|F = T, because according to the OR operator, if at least one of the inputs is True, the output is True. So formula will now look like this: e & T which is equivalent to e. The equivalent simplification in terms of e can be found at the end (step2).

Step 2: For the part (T&((T|F)&F)), it simplifies as follows: T&F, which is equivalent to False, as according to the AND operator, if any one of the inputs is False, the output is False.

Step 3: For (F&((T&F)|T), the result is False, using the previous step and the fact that, according to the AND operator, if any one of the inputs is False, the output is False. So, F & False means it is False.

((F)|(((!(w|(!(F&F)&((!((F&T)|(T&T)))|T))))|T)&((F|(T&F))&T))).

Secondly, any statement logically NOTted with False (F) is always True. Also, any statement logically ORed with True (T) is always True. So, ""(!((F&T)|(T&T)))"" and ""(((!(w|(!(F&F)&T))|T)"", both resolve to True. Therefore, the next simplification is:

((F)|(True|T)&((F|(T&F))&T)).

Thirdly, any statement logically ANDed with True (T) is simply just the statement itself, so ""True|T"" is actually just True. We can make the final simplification as follows:

((F)|True&((F|(T&F))&T)).

Fourthly, any statement logically ORed with False (F) is just the statement itself. The logic sentence ""(T&F)"" can be transformed into ""F"". Applying these rules, the sentence becomes:

((F)|True&(F&T)).

Lastly, any statement logically ANDed with False is always False and any statement logically ORed with True is always True. Therefore, ""True&(F&T)"" turns into ""True&F"" and then into only ""F"". So, the formula will be:

Then, we have the fact that 'P OR P' is equal to 'P'. Applying this to '(e & e)' and '(T | T)', we get 'e' and 'T', respectively. 

We also know that 'P AND False' and 'P OR True' are equal to False and True respectively, so we can simplify '(T & F)' and 'T|(T|(T|(F|T)))' to 'F' and 'T', respectively.

Also, 'NOT True' is False, and 'NOT False' is True. So '!(e & True)' and '!False' can be simplified to '!e' and 'True', respectively.

- Similarly, ""f|F"" is the same as ""f"".
- ""F&T"" will always be False, regardless of T value.
- ""T|T"" is always True, regardless of T value.

So, we can rewrite the formula as follows:
((q|(((h&h)&T)&F))|((T|((!(f&(T&(!F))))&F)|F))&T))).

Following the same logic:
- ""h&h"" is the same as ""h"".
- ""(((h)&T)&F)"" will always be False, because any expression AND False is always False.
- From the previous point, we can then say ""q|False"" is the same as ""q"".
- ""T&(!F)"" is the same as ""T"" because NOT False is True, and anything AND True is itself.
- ""(f&(T))"" will just be the same as ""f"".
- ""!(f)"" will give us NOT f.
- ""NOT f&F"" will always be False, because NOT f can only be True or False, and anything AND False is always False.
- This means ""(T|False|F)&T"" equals to T.

Putting these all together, we can simplify the formula to:

This simplifies to:

Let's simplify further:

This in turn simplifies to F because false AND-ed with any operation always returns false, so we end up with (true & false).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Let's first look at subsets: 
    `T&F` & `T|T` can be simplified to `F` & `T` which are `F` & `T` respectively.
    
    This means `v&(((T&F)|(T|T))&T))` can be simplified to `v&(F&T)`, becoming `v&F`, further simplifying to just `F`.

    `(!(((!F)|F)&T))` can be simplified to `!(T&T)`, becoming `!T`, simplifying to `F`.

    Now we could simplify `l|((F&F)|T)` to `l|(F|T)`, further simplifying to `l|T`. Because anything OR TRUE is always `T`.

2) Now we have `((F|(T|T))&(b&(T&((F&F)&T))))`, this can be simplified further to `((F|T)&(b&(T&(F&T))))`.

3) Since any Boolean OR TRUE is always TRUE, and any Boolean AND FALSE is always FALSE, we end up with `(T&(b&F))`.

4) Again, any Boolean AND FALSE is FALSE, so we further simplify to just `F`.

Hence, the above logic formula simplifies down to `F`.",F,F,VERO

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify ((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&((!T)&F))))|((T&(y|(T|((!T)&(F|F)))))|F))).
`!T` is equivalent to `F`, so `((!T)&F)` is `F`, and `((!T)&(F|F))` is also `F`. So, it becomes ((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&F)))|((T&(y|F))|F))).
`F&(x&(m&F))` is `F`, `T&(y|F)` is `y`, and both sides are joined by an OR operation, therefore it becomes `F|y|F` which simplifies to `y`.

So, the simplified version of that part is `T&y`, which simplifies to `y` because `True AND something` is equal to `something`.

Now the formula is `(!(f|y))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T)`.

In `b|(b&b)`, `b&b` is `b`, thus `b|b` is `b`, and `b|T` and `T` are both `T`.

So the overall formula simplifies to `(!(f|y))|T`.

In any logical expression, when T is present in an OR operation it will always result into T, because `x OR True = True`, so we can ignore the rest of the expression and state that the result will be `T` (or True).",T,T,VERO

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Logical laws which are used for simplifications include

- Null law: A | T = T and A & F = F
- Complement law: A | (!A) = T and A & (!A) = F
- Idempotent law: A | A = A and A & A = A
- Double Negation law: !!A = A
- Absorption law: A | (A & B) = A and A & (A | B) = A
- De Morganâ€™s law: !(A & B) = !A | !B and !(A | B) = !A & !B

Now simplify the given expression ((((w|(n&F))&w)|((F|((a|T)|((!(T|((v&(v&(v&v)))|((F|(p&F))|T))))|(F|(!(T|F))))))&F))|(T&F)) using above laws.

Since A & F = F and A | F = A, 
n & F = F and p & F = F so, the expression simplifies to:
((((w|F)&w)|((F|((a|T)|((!(T|((v&v)&(F|T))))|(!(T|F))))&F))|(T&F))

Now substitute A & A = A:
((w&w)|((F|(a|(!(T|T))))|F)|(T&F))

Then A & (!A) = F and A | T = T, yields:

Then replace A & A = A and A | T = T:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that the logical ""and"" (&) with False (F) is always False and logical ""or"" (|) with True (T) is always True. That means any literals and conditions connected via such operators can be reduced.

During simplification:
- F & T = F

- T & any value(var) = any value(var)
- T | any value(var) = T
- any value(var) & any value(var) = any value(var)
- any value(var) | any value(var) = any value(var)

Now, start simplifying from the innermost brackets:

- F | (F & (T & F)), (T & F) simplifies to F, so this becomes F | F which simplifies to F.
- (T & T) simplifies to T.
- (x & T) simplifies to x.
- (x | x) simplifies to x.
- (F & T) simplifies to F.
- T & T simplifies to T.
- (i & (i | T)) simplifies to i, because i | T is always T.

With these simplifications, the formula:

((i & (!F)) | (i | ((i & i)|i)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, note that adding anything to T with an 'or' operation (|) results in T. This is because 'or' requires only one of the operands to be true. Thus, (F | (T | (!T))) is equivalent to T. 

Similarly any statement 'and' with F is F. Hence (F & the_whole_statement) is simply F. 

The not operator (!) also reverses the value of the operand. (!T) is equivalent to F and (!(!T)) is equivalent to T. 

Let's substitute these values in the given expression.

The given expression :

2. First, we can simplify (((g|T)|(T|F))&(!F)). Here, g|T is T, T|F is T and !F is T. Hence whole thing becomes (T&T), which is T.

3. F | F = F

((s|F)|((F|(!(T|(!(F&(((z&(z&z))&T)|T))&F)))))&((p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T)))

According to rule 2, F&(((z&(z&z))&T)|T) simplifies to F.
Then, the expression looks like:

((s|F)|((F|(!(T|!(F&F)))))&((p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T)))

From rule 6, F&F can be simplified to F.
The expression then becomes:

((s|F)|((F|(!(T|!F)))))&((p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T)))

From rule 9, !F simplifies to T. Consequently, 

((s|F)|((F|(!(T|T)))))&((p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T)))

From rule 3, T|T simplifies to T.
The expression then becomes:

((s|F)|((F|!(T))))&((p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T))|T)))

From rule 8, !(T) simplifies to F.
From rules 1 and 3, our expression simplifies to:

(s|F) & (p|T)

From rules 1 and 3, our expression finally simplifies to:

s & T

From rule 4, s & T simplifies to s.

So, the final simplified logic formula is: s.",s,s,VERO

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's isolate the expressions that have T (True) in them. In the 'or' operation, if one of the operands is true, then the entire expression is true. So, wherever there is an 'or' with T, we can just erase the whole thing and replace it with T. 

The expressions simplify as follows:

(F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T)) turns into T.

((F|(F&(!((F|F)&T))))|F) turns into F.

e|(T|(f&F)) turns into T. 

Finally, v|T turns into T.

So, the initial expression 

((o|(o&(o&(((F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T)|F))))|((v|(e|(T|(f&((F|(F&(!((F|F)&T))))|F)))))|T))

simplifies to ((o|(o&(o&T)|F))|T), and this further simplifies to T. 

Note that in all steps of simplification we've used the following basic properties of Boolean logic:

a|T = T 

a|F = a 

a&T = a 

a&F = F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the result of any logical expression and 'F' is always 'F' and any logical expression or 'F' is always equal to logical expression. So we can simplify the expression as follows:

((F&e)|F)&((T|(!(y&F)))|F)

Secondly, in the case of ""T&F"" or ""F&T"", the result is always 'F'. Any logical expression and 'T' is equal to logical expression.

Now applying these rules, we can further simplify the expression as following:

(F&e)&((T|(!y))|F)   

In the logic operation ""&"", if one element is 'F', this operation will always be 'F':

F & T = F

Now our final simplified expression will be 'F'.",F,F,VERO

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The logical and of F (False) with any other Expression is False. Hence, F&T, F&(!T), F&W, ((F&F)&(F|T)) and all other instances of F& of a False statement = F. 

2. When there is and or not operation with T (True), we just replace the whole term with the other.
   For example, T&X = X, !T=F etc.

3. If we have a logical or of X (any Expression) with F then the result is X. If we have a logical or of X with T then the result is T.

4. In case of or operation, if an Expression is or-ed with itself then the result is just the Expression. For example, (o|o)|o=o

The simplified version of this formula is: Y or F, which is equivalent to Y. Therefore, this complex logical formula is just y.",y,y,VERO
