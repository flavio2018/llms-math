A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the MIN and SM operations:

MIN 3 1 1 9 is 1 (because 1 is the smallest)
SM 5 3 8 5 is 1 (because (5+3+8+5) mod 10 is 21 mod 10, which is 1)
SM 8 4 6 5 is 3 (because (8+4+6+5) mod 10 is 23 mod 10, which is 3)
SM 5 8 0 2 is 5 (because (5+8+0+2) mod 10 is 15 mod 10, which is 5)

Similarly, the expression [MAX 9 0 5 0] will yield the maximum of the integers 9, 0, 5, 0, which is 9.

SM 9 3 8 8 => 28, but since the operation is modulo 10, the result is 8.
SM 0 7 5 8 => 20, modulo 10, gives us 0.

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[SM [SM 4 [MAX 9 2 5 9] 6 [MAX 3 0 7 5]] 4 [MIN [MAX 7 9 9 9] 7 [MAX 5 6 1 5] 1] 1].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the MAX operations. These will take the maximum value from the given number.

[SM [SM 4 [MAX 9 2 5 9] 6 [MAX 3 0 7 5]] 4 [MIN [MAX 7 9 9 9] 7 [MAX 5 6 1 5] 1] 1] =
[SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1]

Now, let's solve the SM operation. This is sum and modulus operation. Hence, for each SM operation, we will sum the numbers and then take the modulus of the result by 10.

[SM 26 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1]=
[6 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1]

Finally, the MIN operation. This will take the minimum value between the given inputs.

[6 4 1 1]= 1. 

So, the output of the entire expression would be 1.",1,2

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[SM [SM [MAX 9 2 4 6] [MAX 8 2 4 0] 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] [MIN 8 9 1 6]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we should solve the expressions inside the innermost brackets, which are operations MAX and MIN. 

MAX operators: 
MAX 9 2 4 6 results in 9 (maximum number among 9, 2, 4, and 6)
Similarly, MAX 8 2 4 0 results in 8.

MIN operation:
MIN 8 9 1 6 results in 1, which is the smallest number among 8, 9, 1, and 6.

So, the expression becomes: [SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 [SM 0 6 5 7] 1]].

Now, we should compute the SM operations:

SM operation on: [SM 0 6 5 7]
0+6+5+7=18 and 18 modulo 10 = 8

So the expression converts to [SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 [SM 2 7 8 1]]. Afterward, we solve the new SM operation:

SM operation on [SM 2 7 8 1]
2+7+8+1=18 and 18 modulo 10 = 8

This gives us now the following expression: [SM [SM 9 8 1 8] 7 4 8].

Continuing to solve the remaining SM operations:

SM operation on [SM 9 8 1 8]
9+8+1+8=26 and 26 modulo 10 = 6

This reduces the expression to: [SM 6 7 4 8]

Finally we can compute the last SM operation:

SM operation on [SM 6 7 4 8]
6+7+4+8=25 and 25 modulo 10 = 5

So, the result of the entire expression is 5.",5,5

Solve the following expression involving these operators:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's resolve the MIN and MAX operators within the brackets:

The smallest number among 8, 0, 6, 1 is 0.
So, [MIN 8 0 6 1] = 0.

The smallest number among 0, 3, 2, 5 is 0.
So, [MIN 0 3 2 5] = 0.

The max number among 0, 4, 0, 4 is 4.
So, [MAX [MIN 8 0 6 1] 4 [MIN 0 3 2 5] 4] = 4.

The smallest number among 7, 3, 5, 4 is 3.
So, [MIN 7 3 5 4] = 3.

Next, let's resolve the SM operators within the brackets:

The sum of 3, 8, 8, 0 is (3+8+8+0) = 19, but we only keep the last digit due to modulo 10, so it is 9. So, [SM 3 8 8 0] = 9.

The SM of 6 and 9 is (6+9) = 15, but we only keep the last digit due to modulo 10, so it is 5. So, [SM 6 [SM 3 8 8 0]] = 5.

The SM of the previous result and 3 is (5+3) = 8, but we only keep the last digit due to modulo 10, so it is 8. So, [SM 6 [SM 3 8 8 0] [MIN 7 3 5 4]] = 8.

Finally, let's resolve the MAX operator:

The max number among 4, 8, 8, 7 is 8.
So, [MAX 0 [MAX [MIN 8 0 6 1] 4 [MIN 0 3 2 5] 4] [SM 6 [SM 3 8 8 0] [MIN 7 3 5 4] 8] 7] = 8.",8,7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First compute the nested calculations: 

[SM 6 5 3 7] results in (6 + 5 + 3 + 7) = 21. But it’s modulo 10, so we get 1.
[MIN 1 4 8 9] gives 1 (the smallest number).
[MAX 7 9 [MIN 0 7 5 0] [SM 3 1 1 4]]:  
For [MIN 0 7 5 0], the least value is 0.
For [SM 3 1 1 4], the result is 9 (3 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9). But it’s modulo 10, so we get 9.
The expression now simplifies to [MAX 7 9 0 9].
Of these, the largest value is 9.

So, the original expression is now: [MAX 3 3 1 1 8 9].
Again, the maximum value here is 9. So, the solution is 9.",9,9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the innermost expressions:

- MIN [6 3 4 3] = 3
- MIN [4 1 3 8] = 1
- MIN [9 3 4 4] = 3
- MAX [8 4 4 7] = 8

Replace these in the original expression:

MAX [MIN [3] 7 [1] 9] 8 7 [SM [3] 1 8 [8]]

Further simplify the MIN and SM operations:

- MIN [3 7 1 9] = 1
- SM [3 1 8 8] = (3 + 1 + 8 + 8) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0

Replace these in the expression:

MAX [1] 8 7 [0]

Finally, find the maximum value:

MAX [1 8 7 0] = 8

So, the result of the entire expression is 8.",8,8
