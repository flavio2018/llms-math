A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. According to the OR-identity where something OR True equals True, (F|(k|T)) simplifies to T and (F|(F&(l|T))) simplifies to F. Our formula then becomes:

    ((x&(x&(T&(((m|F)&((m&m)|(m|F)))|T))))|F).

2. Also considering OR-identity properties ((m|F)&((m&m)|(m|F))), where X OR False equates to X and X and X equates to X, this simplifies to m. We slot that in:

    ((x&(x&(T&(m|T))))|F).

3. The simplified formula applying the OR-identity again (m|T) becomes T:

    ((x&(x&(T&T))))|F).

4. In - AND semantics, T AND T equals T. Therefore, replacing, gives us:

3. Replace these into your sentence: (g&((n|(n&(n)))&(T|F)&F))&n&F).
4. The logical AND association has the property (A AND (B AND C)) = ((A AND B) AND C), we can rewrite the formula as g&n&n&n&T&F&n&F.
5. Using the association property of the OR operator, we can rewrite like g&n&T&F&F.
6. As we know, anything ANDed with FALSE is FALSE and anything ORed with TRUE is TRUE, we can simplify further:

2. X & T = X
3. X & F = F
4. X | T = T
5. X | F = X

7. !F = T

Applying these laws:

((f&((((f|F)|((f&f)&((f&T)|(F&T))))|f)&(f&!F))))&(F|(z|T)) 

First, simplify (f&f), (f&T), (F&T), and (!F), these will become f, f, F and T respectively

Combine (f|(F&F)) will become f
((f&((f|f)|f)&T))&(F|(z|T))

(f|f) and (f|f) both simplify to f so:
((f&f&T))&(F|(z|T))

again as (f&f) = f,
(f&T)&(F|(z|T))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, if we apply logic to the expression, we know that:
- `F&F` equals `F`, because the 'and' operation with false results in false.
- `T|T` equals `T`, because the 'or' operation with true results in true.
- `F&T` is also `F`, because 'and' operation with false results in false.
- `!F`, which means Not False, equates to `T` (True).

So we get:

Simplify the next layer of expression:
- `((F)&(T))` equals `F`, because 'and' operation with false results in false.
- `(T&(!F))` will be `T`.

The expression now boils down to:
   
    `!((F|(!(F&F)))&((k|T)|F))`.

- `(F&F)` equates to `F`.
- `(!(F))` or Not False equates to `T`.

Our equation now is 

    `!((F|T)&((k|T)|F))`.

- `(F|T)` equals `T`, because 'or' operation with true equates true.
- `((k|T)|F)` equals `T`, because 'or' operation with true is true.

The formula now is:

    `!(T&T)`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The first step is to simplify the constant values T and F. The expression (!F) represents logical NOT of False, which is True. And (!T) represents logical NOT of True, which is False. Let's replace these values:

   ((!T)|T) & (!(((F&F)&((F|F)&((d&(F|F))|(F|(!F)))))&T)).

2. The expression (!T)|T) can be viewed as NOT True OR True, which is always True regardless of the value of T. So, we replace the whole expression with T. 

   Also, the expression (((F&F)&((F|F)&((d&(F|F))|(F|(!F)))))&T) can be simplified. Both (F&F) and (F|F) are always F. So the whole expression becomes:

   T & !((F&((d&F)|(F)))&T).

3. Let's simplify further (d&F) which means d AND F (False). The result of AND operation with False is always False. So, the expression becomes:

   T & !((F&(F||(F)))&T).

4. Again we can simplify (F||(F)) which means OR operation with both False. The result of OR operation with False is always False. Hence the expression becomes:

   T & !(F&T).

5. Finally, F&T is always False, because the result of AND operation with False is always False. Hence the final expression after simplification is:

   T & !F.

6. The result of NOT operation with False is True. So the overall simplified formula is:

   T & T.

7. The result of AND operation with True is always True. Hence the overall simplified formula becomes:

2. (y|F)|((y|y)|((y&T)&(F|T))) is equivalent to y|y|y|(y&T), which is simply y|(y&T), because the operation OR is idempotent, that is, y|y is equal to y for any Boolean value y.

3. (y&T)&(F|T) is always True for any Boolean values T and F. Therefore, y|(y&T) simplifies to y|y, which is simply y.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we will eliminate all the impossible conditions from the equation. The And operator ""&"" gives a true value when both conditions are true; however, if one of them is false, the entire operation becomes false. Hence, we go step-by-step in the equation:
 
1. (F&T) -> Always gives False as T can't be logically 'and' with False. Thus, the second half of the expression after the outermost '&' operator becomes False.

So, ((n&( (n|((n|F)&n)) &n)|F)|(F|((j&(F&(!F)))|T)) ) & ((F&T)&T)) simplifies to

3. (F&(!F)) - > This will always be false because false and true equals to false (rules of logical 'and' operator).

4. j&(F&(!F)) = j&F -> This will always be false as for logical 'and' operator, if any one of the condition is false, the entire condition becomes false.

5. (F|((j&(F&(!F)))|T)) - > This simplifies to (F|F|T) . As logical 'or' operator gives true if any one of the condition is true among all, this will always be true (T).

6. n|F -> This will provide the value of n as logical 'or' with false gives the value of operand.

7. ((n|F)&n) -> This will offer the value of n as logical 'and' with itself always gives the value of operand itself.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify (((F|T)&T)|F)) to T, because the 'or' operation with F and T is T, T & T also equals T, and lastly any value 'or' with F remains the same value, so it remains T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (!F) simplifies to True (as ""not False"" will be True) and (F|T) becomes True (as False or True is always True).

3. (T|T) is always True. And, F&T is always False. Thus, !(F&T) will be True.

4. Again, AND with True, won't change the original literal value. So, T with True gives us just T.

5. Now we have the formula simplified to: !((s&T)|(T&(x|T))). Another simplification that can be done here is that, for any literal, OR operation with True gives True. So, (s&T) will be s and (x|T) will be T.

6. Then it becomes: !((s&T)|T) which simplifies to !(s&T), since OR with True is always True.

7. Distribution rule for NOT operation states that, !(A&B) is equivalent to (!A | !B). Thus, using this rule on the above, we get: !s|!T.

8. Lastly, since not of True gives False, it's replaced in the formula, which will give us: !s|F.

4. Then, (b|((!(!F))&(((T|T)&(s|T))|T))) simplifies to b|True = True due to the OR (|) operator which returns True if any one operand is True. 

5. (b&T)&b simplifies to just b, because T & any statement is just the statement itself, and conjuncting a statement with itself is the statement itself.

6. Thus, b|((!(!F))&(((T|T)&(s|T))|T)))|((b&T)&b) is equal to True.

Next, we will simplify ""(l|(T|F))"". Replacing ""T|F"" with T, we get ""(l|T)"". The logical OR returns true if either or both of its inputs are true, so ""(l|T)"" will always return T.

Therefore, ""(!(l|(T|F)))"" simplifies to ""!T"", and since the logical NOT operator inverts the truth value, we get F.

So, the original formula simplifies to ""((((F)&T)|F)&F)|(F&((!((((o&o)&(o&T))|o)|T))&F))"".

Next, if we simplify ""((((F)&T)|F)&F)"", we know that F&T gives F and F|F gives F. Hence the given expression reduces to F&F which is F.

Let's see ""((o)&(o&T))|T"". Now (o&T) will be either True or False i.e., o. Hence, given expression simplifies to ""((o)&o)|T"" which is ""o|T"". The output will always be T.

Then ""!(((o)&(o&T))|T)"" becomes ""!T"", which is F.

Since any value ORed with True will always result in True, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The given logic formula can be simplified by applying the known rules of Boolean algebra. Let's work it out in steps:

Step 1: Substitute `F` for `o|F` since anything OR `False` equals to the original statement (`o` in this case). Also, anything AND `False` equals to `False`.

Your formula reduces to: 

`(((((s|((o&F)&F))&T)&T)|((!((T&((F|F)&F))|F))&F))|(!F))`

=> `(((((s|F)&T)&T)|((!F|F)&F))|T)`

Step 2: Remembering the rule `Anything AND False equals False || Anything AND True equals the same expression || True OR Anything equals True`:

=> `(s&T)|((F)&F)|T`

=> `s|F|T`

Step 3: Remembering the rule `Anything OR True equals True || Anything OR False equals the same expression`:

=> `s|T`

=> `True`

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. For any value of a boolean variable x, x | T will always be true (according to the properties of logical OR operation). Hence, a | T = T.

2. Also, for any value of a boolean variable x, x & T will always be equal to x (according to the properties of logical AND operation). Hence, h & T = h.

3. Finally, for any value of a boolean variable x, x | F will always be equal to x (according to the properties of logical OR operation). Hence, h | F = h.

Plugging these into the given formula, we get:

Again note that 

(!(!T)) = T and 

(!(!T)) = T and 

(!(!h)) = h

Makes the formula now:

(!(!((h & h | T)))

Simplifying we get:

(!(!(h | T))

Again we use the fact that for any bool variable x, x | T = T. Let's apply it to h | T, which is T.

2. Similarly, (f&(f&T))|F simplifies to `f& T | F` which equals `f | F` which is just `f` , so `(f&(f&(((f&(f&T))|F)&f)))` simplifies to `f&f`, which is just `f`.

4. Repeating and and or operation of same literal does not change its own value. Hence (r&r) is r and (i|i) is i.

T | T is True or True. The result according to the OR operation is True.

We can further simplify considering that anything logical 'and' with True remains the same and logical 'and' with False gives True. Now we also know that anything 'or' with False remains the same and 'not' True is False. So our formula further simplifies to:

l & l & l & (r | True)

Anything logical 'and' with True remains the same and anything logical 'or' with True becomes True. So we further simplify to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F|T simplifies to T, so the formula can be simplified to: 
((c|(c&F))&(s|(T|((((T&F)|(T&F))&T)&((T&T)|F))|T))).

2. c&F simplifies to F, F|T simplifies to T and T&F simplifies to F as well, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that: F&T always gives False and T|(F&F) gives True. Replace these values:

(((v|F)&v)&(((((v|F)&((v|F)|T))|(v|v))|v)&v))

Next, v|F and v|v will simplify as v, besides, v|T will be T. Substitute these operations in the formula.

(((v&v)&((T|(v|v))&v))

This simplifies as:

(v&(T&v))

It's also similar to:

((l|(l&T))|(l&((l&l)&(((l&((T|F)&(T&T)))&l)&((l&(l|l))&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, any logical AND with T is the same as itself and any logical OR with F is the same as itself. Thus, (T|F)&(T&T) simplifies to T&F which is F. Also, In the same fashion, (l|l) results in l.

So, we simplify ((l|(l&T))|(l&((l&l)&(((l&F)&l)&((l&l)&T))))) as ((l|l)|(l&((l&l)&((l&F)&l)))). 

Then, any logical AND with F is F, so (l&F) will be F. Hence the expression simplifies further to:

((l|l)|(l&((l&l)&F))). 

As l&l is l and l&F is F, so the expression converts to: 

(l|F). 

Finally, l or F is l which is the final simplified version of the provided expression.",l,l

((T|(F|F))|(F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T)))|(!(F&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify (F|F), (p&F), (T&F), (F&T) all of them will be F because OR with both false is false & AND operation with false is always false.
Replace these in above expression, we get

((T|(F))|(F&((T&((g&F)&F))|(T|T)))|(!F)).

Next, (T|(F)), (T&F), (T|T) these will be T, F and T respectively because according to logic rules true or false is always true, true & false is always false and true or true is always true.
Replace these in above expression, we get

(T|(F&(F&F))|T).

In the above, expression (F&F), (F&(F&F)), (T|F) these will be F, F and T respectively because false and false is always false and true or false is always true.
Replace these in above expression, we get

(T|F|T).

In any OR operations if any of the values are true the whole expression is true, hence

The simplified form of the given logical formula is T (True).",T,T

(!((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (F|T) equals T because true or false is always true.
2. (F|F) equals F because false or false is always false.
3. (!T) equals F because not true is false; 
   (!F) equals T because not false is true.

So we can simplify and replace some parts of the formula:

(!((o|T)&((F&(s&(F|F)))|((F&(F&(F|F)))&F)))) = !((o|T)&((F&s&F)|F)) = !((o|T)&F).

4. Any expression AND with F is always F.

This simplifies the formula to:

!((o|T)&F) = !(F) = T.

So, the simplified logic formula is T, meaning that it is always true.",T,T
