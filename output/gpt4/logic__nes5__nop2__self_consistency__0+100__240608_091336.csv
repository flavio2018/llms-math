A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, we have T&F, it will always evaluate to false, regardless of what the value of t is. Because if even one value in an AND operation is false, the whole expression becomes false.

(((w|w)|T)|(((w|w)&((!F)&(h&F)))&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The symbol | is logical 'or'. In other words, if either statement is true, the output is true. Therefore (w|w) just simplifies to 'w' because if 'w' is true, the result is true; if 'w' is false, the result is false. Hence, the formula is now ((w|T)|(((w&((!F)&(h&F)))&F))).

2. Since 'w|T' contains the logical 'or', and one of the components is 'T' (True), no matter what 'w' is (true or false), the output will be true. Hence, (w|T) simplifies to T, and the formula becomes (T|(((w&((!F)&(h&F)))&F))).

3. Similarly (T|X) for any 'X' simplifies to 'T', because the logical 'or' operator with one of components being True always returns True. 

4. Inside the formula, (!F) simplifies to T, because itâ€™s a logical NOT operation on False. So we can further simplify the ((w&((!F)&(h&F)))&F))) to ((w&((T)&(h&F)))&F).

5. Then, ((T)&(h&F))) simplifies to (h&F), because T and any statement (X) simplifies to X. Therefore, the formula becomes ((w&(h&F))&F).

6. Again, any statement and False (X&F) always returns False. Hence, ((w&(h&F))&F) simplifies to F.

    For T&(F|(!T)), in this, replace (!T) with False (as it means not true), which yields T&(F|F). This simplifies to T&F, which is equivalent to False.

2. Now, we substitute T&(F|(!T)) with False in the main formula - (!(False))&((u|(T|(F|T)))|T). The not operator flips False to True, yielding True&((u|(T|(F|T)))|T).

3. Simplify T|(F|T) to define True, since T(True) or any other value is always True. This simplifies the expression to True&(u|T).

4. Finally, again u|T is always True because T (True) or any other value is always True. Hence, the expression further simplifies to True&True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, according to De Morgan's Laws, !(A | B) = (!A & !B), so let's apply it: 

From !(F | (((F & T) | (T & T)) | !T)), it becomes => (!(!F) & !(((F & T) | (T & T)) | !T))

Next, we know that !(!F) becomes T and !T becomes F:

(!(!F) => T) and (!T => F) 

So, the revised formula becomes => (T & !(((F & T) | (T & T)) | F))

Next, we simplify inside the brackets as follow:

(F & T) = T (since F always False)
(T & T) = T (since both are True)
So, ((F & T) | (T & T))  becomes => (F | T), which will be always True, because T is True

Our formula simplifies to: (T & !(T | F)), which simplifies to T & !T

2. Similarly (T&T) is always T and (T|T) is always T.
3. Again, in (T|F), since anything OR False remains the same, the term is T. 

So we substitute these results to simplify:

((g&(T&T))|(T&F))

4. Anything AND True remains the same, so (T&T) is T and (g&T) is g. Similarly anything AND False is always False, so (T&F) is F.

Next, anything & T is itself, so the formula becomes T & T & ((h & T) | h | T).

2. Similarly, r&F -> False, because anything AND False is always False.
3. Any value OR False is always equal to the original value so we simplify (r&F)|F to be equal to False.

Now our formula looks like: 
((F&(!F))&(!(((False)|F)&(T&(T&T))))).

4. T&T -> True, because True AND anything is always that thing, True in this case. 
5. So, our formula includes now T&(T&T) and will become T&T -> True.
   
That leaves us with:

((F&(!F))&(!(((False)|F)&True))).

6. Any value OR False is always equal to the value, so (False)|F -> False.

Stated differently, disjunction of False with anything results in the same thing. Also, conjunction of False with anything results in False.
So, (F|F) = F and (F&F) = F. 

Since the result of both (F|F) and (F&F) are equal to F, ((F|F)|(F&F)) becomes (F|F) which is F. 

So, ((h|F)&((F|F)|(F&F))) = (h&F) which simplifies to F.

At this point, the formula becomes (q|F) which simplifies to q.

""T"" (True) is the neutral element for logical conjunction (""&""). Thus, anything AND'ed with T results in the same thing. So, (T&T) is equal to T.

Since True conjunction (""&"") with anything gives the same thing, (q&T) simplifies to q.

so T | F & T can be written as T|F which is always T.

Now because T is used in an And operation with anything, the value of the operation is equal to the other operand.
l|F is equal to l because Or operation always returns True (T) when one of operands is T. And l|T is just equal to T. 
Now the formula looks like:
(l&(l&(c|T)).
Finally, we can simplify this even a bit more: (l&l) can be simplified to just l, since if l is True this will be True and vice versa. And (c|T) is simply True after applying the Or operation.

    Using the rule which states that a logical statement ""and"" with itself equals to itself, we can simplify (g&g) to just (g).
    
    Also, for ((g&T)&T), since ""and"" operation with T (True), whatever value 'g' has, the result is the same 'g'. Therefore, ((g&T)&T) simplifies to just (g).

So, we can simplify the formula to: ((((g|g)|g)&(g|F))&(T|F)).

Step 2: simplify (g|g)

    Using the principle of idempotence, which states that a value ""or"" with itself is itself, we can simplify (g|g) to just (g).

So, our formula now becomes: (((g|g)&(g|F))&(T|F)).

Step 3: simplify (g|F)

    According to the laws of Boolean algebra, any value ""or"" with false is itself.

Hence, (g|F) simplifies to just (g). 

Resulting formula becomes, ((g&g)&(T|F)).

Step 4: simplify (g&g) 

    We can simplify (g&g) to just (g) as we did in the first step.

So, the formula becomes (g&(T|F)).

Step 5: simplify (T|F)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we will solve from inside to outside. 

T & F result is F, because logical and requires both operands to be true to give a true result. Therefore, we have F | (T & F), which simplifies further to F | F, and final result is F.

So !((T & F) & !(T & (T&T))) simplifies to !((T & F) & !(T & T)).

Now T & T is T, therefore it alters to !((T & F) & !T).

In the next step, we will solve !T, which is obviously F. Thus, the expression becomes !((T & F) & F).

Continuing, T & F results in F again, making the expression !(F & F), which simplifies to !F. 

Remembering that ! means logical not, the result of !F is T.

So, the simplified version of the original logic formula is T.",T,T

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that anything Or-ed (|) with False (F) gives the original value and anything And-ed (&) with False (F) gives False. So, (F&F) will be False.

Also, something And-ed (&) with True (T) gives the original value.

So, we can simplify the given formula as follows:

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))) gives 
(((l&(T|F))|l)|(F&(!(F)))) gives
(((l&T)|l)|(F&(!F))) gives
((l|l)|(F&True)) gives
l | (F & True) gives
l | F

Finally, we know that anything Or-ed (|) with False (F) gives the original value. So the formula simplifies to:

((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the operations dealing with true (T) and false (F) constants:

T & F = F (since true and false equals false)
F & F = F (since false and false equals false)

Then, apply these results back to the original formula:

((T&(T&(o&F))) | (k&(T&F | F)))

This simplifies to:

((T&(T&F)) | (k&F))

Second, any true or false value logically and-ed with false gives you false. Therefore:

T & F = F
k & F = F

So the above equation simplifies to:

(F | F)

Finally, a false value logically or-ed with a false value still gives you false. Therefore, the simplified value is:

((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Starting from the deepest operations:

- (F & anything) is always F. So, both (a&F) and (h&F) become F. 
- (F & F) is also F.
- (F | F) is F. 
- (any value | F) is simply any value. 

Thus, the given expression simplifies to (f | (F)) | (f | F), or simply f | f which further simplifies to f.",f,f

(((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b)&(!(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Start solving the formula from inside out.
2) F|F|F is simply F as OR operations among False values results in False.
3) After replacing F|F|F with F, given logic formula becomes: ((((b&T)|b)|F)|b)&(!(!T)).

4) The term b&T can either be T (when b is T) or F (when b is F). But this term is combined with b using an OR operation. Therefore even if b&T gives F (when b is F), the result of (b&T)|b would still be equal to b because F OR with anything gives whatever that thing is. Therefore, (b&T)|b simplifies to b.
5) After this simplification, given logic formula becomes: ((b|F)|b)&(!(!T)).

6) Similar to previous step, b|F would result in T (when b is T) and F (when b is F). But True OR anything is always True and False OR anything is whatever that thing is. Therefore, b|F simplifies to T.
7) After this simplification, given logic formula becomes: (T|b)&(!(!T)).

8) By applying similar reasoning as mentioned in points (4) and (6), (T|b) would simplify to T.
9) After this simplification, given logic formula becomes: T&(!(!T)).

10) As (!(!T)) is double negation of True which is True itself then any expression AND'd with True gives the expression itself. So, the entire expression simplifies to:
T.

((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that for any value:
- A `|` F = A 
- F `&` A = F 
- `!` T = F 
- `!` F = T 

So, let's simplify our formula keeping these rules in mind.

The given formula is:

((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F)))

First, simplify F|F to F:

(F|((((!T)&F)|T)|((F|T)&F)))

Next, simplify !T to F:

(F|((((F)&F)|T)|((F|T)&F)))

This then becomes:

(F|((F|T)|((F|T)&F)))

Next, simplify F|T and F&T:

(F|(T|F))

which further simplifies to:

F|T

Finally, using A `|` F = A, we simplify F|T to T. So, the final simplified version of the formula is:

T",T,T
