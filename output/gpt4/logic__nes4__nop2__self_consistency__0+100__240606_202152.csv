- The Or operation (|) returns True if at least one of the inputs is True, and False otherwise.
- The Not operation (!) inverts the input, turning True into False and vice versa.

Now, let's simplify each part of the formula:

- F in a logical formula stands for ""False"", so ""q|F"" equates to ""q or False"", which simply means ""q"". Thus, ""q&(q|F)"" simplifies to ""q&q"", which just means ""q"".
- !T stands for ""not True"", which equates to ""False"". So ""q|(!T)"" simplifies to ""q or False"", which means ""q"".

F|T (False OR True) is equivalent to True, so the second part of the formula becomes !(True), which is False, because the NOT of a True value is False.

So now our formula looks like this: ((True&T)&(False&T)). Since an AND operation only gives True if both its operands are True, False&T is False. So we have ((True&T)&False). We can simplify (True&T) to True because True AND any value equals that value. So we have True&False which gives us False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the terms in the inner brackets:

- This further simplifies to (T&T) because ""(T&F)"" is just T. 
- Lastly, (T&T) simplifies to T, because ""T and T"" is also True. 

On the other side,
- (!T) is F because ""not True"" is False.
- Thus, ((!T)&F) is basically ""F and F"", which is F.
