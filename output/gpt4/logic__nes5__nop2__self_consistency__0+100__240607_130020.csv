T|T is always True because 'or' operation requires at least one value to be True to result in True.

Now simplify again:

b|F is just b (because 'or' operation with False remains the same)

T&True is just True (because 'and' operation with True remains the same)

Now replace those results back into the formula:

(((a&T)|a)&((b|True)&F))

Now simplify again:

b|True is just True (because 'or' operation with True is always True)

Since 'and' operation requires both values to be True to result in True, anything&F is always False because False will always output False in the 'and' operation.

Simplify again:

a&T is just a (because 'and' operation with True remains the same)

So our formula becomes:

Next, we consider the and operations. Anything and with False (F) is always False, because both parts of the and operation must be true. And anything and with True (T) simply equals the other parameter, because it does not change the result. So the formula simplifies to:

((g&(t|(F|T)))&(g&(g|False)))
((g&(t|T))&(g&g))
((g&T)&g)

The ""g&T"" statement can be simplified because if ""g"" is true, then the ""g&T"" operation is true and if ""g"" is false then ""g&T"" is false. So this operation is equivalent to ""g"". The same applies to ""g&g"". Then, we have:

(g&g) = g

Now, any literal AND with itself is itself, hence:

And any literal OR with itself is also the literal itself:

(l&((l|l)&l))|l => (l&(l&l))|l => (l&l)|l

- F | F = F. False or False will always be false.
- F & T = F. False and True will always be false.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Given formula: ((T|F)&((T&(k|(T&T)))&(T|(F|(T|T)))))

Step 1 - Simplify within the parentheses: 
The result of (T|F) is always T because True OR anything is always True.
The result of (T&T) is T because True AND True is True, therefore it becomes k|T, which results in T because anything OR True is True.
We then have (F|(T|T)) which simplifies to T|T, resulting in T.
We then have (T&T) which is T.

So the formula simplifies to: 
(T&(T&T)&T)

Step 2 - Simplify further:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value | T (value OR True) will always be True, as even if the value is False, the OR relationship with True will make the entire statement True. So, (d|F)|T can be simplified to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, in the expression T&T, both are True so the result is True. You substitute T for (T&T) in your expression:
(((((x|F)|x)&(s|T)))|x)|(!(!F)).

Then, you simplify the use of logical OR with False and logical AND with True, which doesn’t change the other operand:
(((((x|F)|x)&(s)))|x)|(!(!F)) 

Then, x|F becomes x, so you get:

(((((x)|x)&(s)))|x)|(!(!F)) 

When you combine any value with logical OR and itself, the result is itself:

((((x)&(s)))|x)|(!(!F))

Next, something AND something gives you this expression:

((x&s)|x)|(!(!F))

The logical negation, logical NOT, changes True to False and vice versa. Given F is False, NOT F is True, and NOT (NOT F) is False:

((x&s)|x)|F

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we simplify the innermost part of the expression and we know that anything ""and"" with False is always False, hence F&F gives False. That leaves us with F inside the brackets so:

(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F))) simplifies to (((l&(T|F))|l)|(F&(!(d&F))) 

We know that anything ""or"" with False remains the same, hence T|F gives us T:

This now simplifies to ((l&T)|l)|(F&(!d)) 

Given the nature of ""and"", particularly anything ""and"" with True remains the same. Therefore, l&T simplifies to l:

Leaving us with (l|l)|(F&(!d)) 

An operation ""or"" with two same values will remain the same, so l|l simplifies to l:

Thus, we now have l|(F&(!d))

Given the logic rules, the not operation will turn False into True, leaving us with:

l|(F&d)

And since the operation ""and"" with False will result in False:

l|F

Finally, an operation ""or"" with False will remain the same, so we have:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the value for the logic 'and' formula will be False when at least one of its operands is False. 

The True and False values under the parentheses for 'and' terms (T&F), (T&(F&F)) will give us False. 

So that simplifies the formula as ((T&(T&(o&F)))|(k&(False|F))). 

This leaves us with ((T&(T&F))|(k&F))

Since (T & F) is False, our formula simplifies to (False|False)

This is equal to False. 

So, ((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))) = False.",False,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expression is:
((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T)))

The logic formula seems complex. However, the fact that we have the logical AND (&) with False (F) simplifies things, since anything AND False is always False.

So, let's simplify it step-by-step:

1. Simplify the innermost AND expressions with F:

""F&((a&F)&F)"" simplifies to ""F&F&F"", which is False. 
""F|(h&F)"" simplifies to ""F|F"", which is also False. 

The formula then becomes:
((f|F)|(f|(F&T)))

2. Now, we again simplify expression ""F&T"", which simplifies to False (since anything AND False is False). 

Then, the formula becomes:
((f|F)|(f|F))

3. The expression ""f|F"" simplifies to ""f"" (since anything OR False is always the initial value). 

Then, the equation simplifies to:
(f|f)

4. And finally, ""f|f"" simplifies to ""f"" (since anything OR itself is always itself).

Therefore, the simplified version of initial logical formula is ""f"".",f,f

2. !(!T) simply means !!T. !! cancels out, leaving us with T.

((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first step is to simplify the elements inside the innermost parentheses:

(!T) would be equal to F because T is True and negation of True is False.

(F|F) would be equal to F because both are False and logical OR operation between two False is also False.

So, (((!T)&(F|F))) simplifies to (F&F) which is equal to F.

Now let's consider the other part, (F|T) which would be equal to T because logical OR between False and True is always True, but when we AND it with F (with (F|T)&F), it becomes False. Logical AND operation between any expression and False is always False.

So, the formula ((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F))) simplifies to (F|(F|T)) which is equal to T because logical OR between any expression and True is always True.",T,T
