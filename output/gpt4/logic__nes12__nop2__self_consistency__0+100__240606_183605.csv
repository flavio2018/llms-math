Now, string together the formulae of logic OR with True (T).

(F|T) = T
(x|T) = T
(F|T) = T

Substitute those results into the formula, which turn it into (T|((c&(T|F)|F))|T).

Next, ""A & A"" simplifies to ""A"". Therefore, ""t & t"", ""d & d"", and ""T & T"" simplify to ""t"", ""d"", and ""T"", respectively. 

Then, ""A | A"" simplifies to ""A"" so ""d | d"" simplifies to ""d"". 

Moving on, ""A | false"" simplifies to ""A"" and ""A | true"" simplifies to ""true"". Therefore, ""F | F"" simplifies to ""false"" and ""d | F"", ""d | T"", ""F | T"", and ""T | T"" simplify to ""d"", ""true"", ""true"", and ""true"", respectively. 

Next, ""false & A"" and ""A & false"" simplify to ""false"". So, ""F & T"" simplifies to ""false"". 

Finally, ""true & A"" and ""A & true"" simplifies to ""A"", ""A & A"" simplifies to ""A"". Thus, ""T & T"" and ""d & true"" simplify to ""T"" and ""d"", respectively. 

After these simplifications, the expression is ((d|((((d|((t&t)&d))|T)&d)|false).

Again simplifying,

""t & t"" simplifies to ""t"".
""d | t"" simplifies to true, because we have assumed ""d"" can take either value true or false. If ""d"" is false, then the overall expression still simplifies to true (because false OR true = true).

From ((T | (F | (T & (j | T)))) | T) & (((i | (i & (i | i))) | T) | F)) | (T & T), you can simplify by noting that T is the identity element for OR (meaning anything OR'd with T is always true), and F is the identity element for AND (meaning anything AND'd with F is always false). So this simplifies to T & T, which is T.
2. ((k & k) | T) can be simplified as T because anything OR'd with T is always True.
3. The NOT of T is F, so !T becomes F.

- (!(!(t&F))) can be simplified to (!(!F)) because 't & F' will always be False (anything AND False is False). (!(!F)) then simplifies to T (since the negation of True is False and the negation of that is True).

The next level is then (F|((T|(T&(!(!(t&F)))))|F))): 

- (T|(T&(!(!(t&F)))) simplifies to T because (T & T) is True and True OR anything is True. 
- This makes our expression F|(T|F) which simplifies to T (True OR anything is True).

Our next level is then (F|(!(T|(F|((T|(T&(!(!(t&F)))))|F))))):

- Which simplifies to (F|(!T)) which is equivalent to F|F that simplifies to False, as not True is False and False or False is False.

Next is (((F&(F|(((w|F)|(!T))&F)))&T)&F). This has w and !T but all instances have AND operation with False. Anything and False is False, hence, this expression simplifies to F.

The next level expression then becomes ((F|(T&F))|T)):

- F | (T & F) simplifies to F | F or F (because True & False is False and False OR False is False)
- The result from above OR T simplifies to T, because False OR True is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, notice that ""F | T"" is always True (T), because anything 'or' True is always True. So simplifying that:

    ¬((f | ¬(w | T)) & F) becomes ¬((f | ¬T) & F) becomes ¬((f | F) & F) becomes ¬(T & F) becomes ¬F which is T.

The inner statement simplifies to:

So the whole statement till here simplifies to:

2. Then we simplify F|(F|T) to get T since anything OR-ed with False is itself and anything OR-ed with True is True.
3. So the formula becomes (((z&((T)|F))|z)|z)&z)&((T|(T&(!(F|(T|((T|((o|(!F))|((q&q)|T)))&F))))))|F).
4. Now let's move to simplify the right-hand part, starting from the most nested clause. We have (!F), which simplifies to T.
5. Then we have (o|(!F))|((q&q)|T), which simplifies to o|T = T.
6. The clause containing o simplifies to (T&F), which simplifies to F.
7. So we have (T|(T&!F|F)) simplifying to T or (T&!T) simplifying to T.
8. So the right-hand part simplifies to T.
9. So the whole clause simplifies to (((z&T)|z|z)&z)|(T).

    - `T&(!F)` equals `T&(T)` which is `T`. 
    - `F|F`(in multiple places) equals `F`.
2. Simplify the formula accordingly:

3. Not False is True, so the expression simplifies further to:

4. (w|True) is True, and ((False)|(True)) is True as well. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

Secondly, ((x&x) equals to x because when both values are the same, the result is also the same value. So we have ((((((x|x))|x)|T)&(!F))&F)|T, which simplifies to ((x | x | T )& (!F)& F).

Also, (x|x) equals to x, because when any of the values is True, the whole expression is True.

2. (T|T|T) simplifies to T because it only needs at least one of the disjuncted values to be True, and in this case, all of them are True.
3. (F&T) simplifies to F because the logical and requires both of the conjuncted values to be True, but in this case one of them is False.
4. F&F simplifies to F because, as per the rule explained above, if one of the values in the logical and is False, the output is False.
5. v|v simplifies to v because the logical or of a value with itself is equal to the value itself.
6. v&v simplifies to v because the logical and of a value with itself is also the value itself.
7. a|F simplifies to a because the logical or of any value with False is equal to that value.
8. (!F) simplifies to T because the logical not of False is True.

1. (a|a&T) simplifies to a because the logical or of any value with its logical and with True is equal to that value.

3. (x&T) simplifies to x because the logical and of any value with True is equal to that value.
4. (x&x) simplifies to x because the logical and of any value with itself is equal to that value.
5. ((v|(v&v)&(x&T)) simplifies to (v|v&x) because of the simplifications done above.

So now we have:
(T&((a&(f|!v&x))&F)).
1. (f|!v&x) simplifies to f|!v because the logical and of any value with False is False.

2. For any value X, X | T = T and X & F = F. OR-ing with True results in True and AND-ing with False results in False.

Let's start simplifying:
((e&(T|F))&(!((!((u|(u|(F&((T&((T|F)&F))|T))))|T))&(a|(T|(F|(F&((s|(((k|F)|F)|T))&F))))))).

The subexpression (T&F) simplifies to F (based on rule 2).

The subexpression (F&T) simplifies to F (based on rule 2).

The subexpression (u|u|(F&T)|T) simplifies to u|F|F|T.

Using these laws, let's proceed:

- First simplify (T|T) to T, and (!(!T)) is equals to T.

- Simplify again from F&(T&T) to F. 
- Notice (((b|((u|(h|(F|(T|T))))|(!(T|(!((v&T)|(T|T)))))))|T)|((T&(!F))|F)) can be very simply orangized as T because anything connected with T using | operation will be T. 
- Then, (((b|T)|F)|F) or (b|T) equals to T.

2. Anything AND TRUE (X&T) becomes X, because TRUE doesn't change the AND operation. So, we substitute (T&XXXX) and ((q|q)|(q|q)) with XXXX and q, respectively. 
3. Anything AND FALSE (X&F) becomes F, because FALSE makes the entire AND operation False. So, we substitute (F&(!F)) with F.
4. Double negative (!(!T)) becomes a single positive, i.e., T.
5. Any value OR itself (X|X) stays the same value X. So, we replace ((q|q)|(q|q)) and (c|c) with q and c, respectively.

Making these substitutions, the original formula turns into:

Next, since (F|T) evalutes to TRUE, this part of the expression simplifies to TRUE, so the formula now becomes:

(c|((c&T)&q|T))&(!T)

Anything AND TRUE (X&T) simplifies to X, so we get:

(c|c&q|T)&(!T)

Also, c|c simplifies to c, so new formula is:

5. F&((F&T)&F) is always False.
6. ((T&(F|(w&F))))&(T&(F&((F&T)&F)))) equates to False because it has T&F.

Using these principles, we see that:
1. (F|F) becomes F.
2. (o&(F|F)) becomes o&F which in turn becomes F.
3. (F|(T&(F|(w&F)))) becomes F because T&(F|(w&F)) is F.
4. ((F|(T&(F|(w&F))))&(T&(F&((F&T)&F)))) becomes F&F which is F.
5. (F|((F|(T&(w&F))))&(T&(F&((F&T)&F)))) becomes (F|F)&F which is F.
6. (x&F) becomes F.
7. (F|((F|(T&(w&F))))&(T&(F&((F&T)&F)))))&(x&F) becomes F&F which is F.
8. (c|(((((o&F)&(F|((F|(T&(w&F))))&(T&(F&((F&T)&F))))))&(x&F))&(F&T))&F)) simplifies to c|F which is same as c
9. ((c&T)&T)&T) simplifies to c&T

So finally, the formula simplifies to:

""((F & (F | (((((p | p) & T) & ((T & F) | T)) & (p | p)) | F) | p) | (T | (a & (T & F))))))"".

3.1) ""p|p"" is equal to p. So we replace ""p|p"" with ""p"". 

3.2) Since ""p & T"" is just ""p"", we can replace ""(p | p) & T"" with ""p"".

3.3) Similarly, we know ""((T & F) | T)"" results in ""F | T"" which is True. So replace ""((T & F) | T)"" with ""T"". 

3.4) The expression then becomes ""((F & (F | ((((p & T) & T) & p) | F) | p)) | (T | (a & F)))"" which simplifies to ""((F & (F | ((p & T) & p)) | (T | F)"".

Also, not of F(False) is T(True). Therefore, the logic formula (!F) simplifies to T. (F|F) simplifies to F since F or F is F.

Let's look at the logic formula (T&(T&F)), this can be simplified to (T&F), since True AND False is False, this simplifies further to F.

Now we have extract the expression in the innermost parentheses (((!T)&F)&T)&(s|(((u|F)|T)|F))) for further simplification. The logic formula (!T&F) simplifies to F since not T value cannot be determined and F is false, then False and any value results in False. This entire chain of nested '&' operations results in F. (T&F) simplifies to False. Therefore, the result of the entire logic formula is (s|(((u|F)|T)|F)) this simplifies to (s|((u|F)|T)) and eventually, simplifies to (s|(u|T)).

Now the original logic formula simplifies to (T|((f&(!(T|T&F)))&T)). This can be further simplified as:
(T|(f&(!T)&T))

The easiest conclusions we can draw from here are:

1. Any value (including f, T etc.) ANDed with false turns into false. Therefore, we can replace the logic formula f&(!T) with F since not T is F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to consider the basic operations of logic:

1) True & False = False, True & True = True, False & False = False (Logical AND)
2) True | False = True, True | True = True, False | False = False (Logical OR)
3) Not True = False, Not False = True (Logical NOT)

With consideration of these basic operations, we can simplify given logical formula as follows:

((T & (T | ((g & F) | F))) & ((!((e | ((((l | (!T)) & T) | F) | (F | (T & (F | (T & T)))))) & F)) & T))

Step 1: (!T)=F, (T & T) = T and (T | F) = T :

((T & (T | ((g & F) | F))) & ((!((e | ((((l | F) & T) | F) | (F | (T & (F | T)))))) & F)) & T))

Step 2: ((g&F)|F) = F, (((l|F)&T) = T | F)= T, (((l|F)&T)|F)=T (l doesn't matter, because OR with False does not make any changes and AND with True does not make any changes too) :

((T & (T|F)) & (((!(e|T))&F)&T))

Step 3: T & (T|F) is equal to T, because an AND operator with True doesn't make any changes and an OR operator with False doesn't make any changes too:

(T & ((!(e|T))&F)&T)

Step 4: (!(e|T)) = !T= F, ((!(e|T))&F)=F (for the very same reason. since OR operator with True gives True, NOT operator transforms True to False, and False & anything = False):

(T & F&T)

Step 5: (T & F&T) is clearly FALSE, because False AND anything = False.

So, the result of simplifying the given logical formula is: F or False.",F,T

With these identities in mind, you can simplify the formula to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, ""(T|T)"" simplified becomes T.

""F&(x&(m&((!T)&F)))"" and ""(F&(...))"" always yield a False or F, because anything AND with False results in a False. So our expression here further simplifies to F. The innermost expression simplify as follows:
- ""!T"" = F
- ""F|F"" = F
- ""T|((!T)&(F|F))"" simplifies to ""T|F"" = T
- ""y|(T|((!T)&(F|F)))"" simplifies to ""y|T"" = T
- ""T&(y|(T|((!T)&(F|F)))"" simplifies to ""T&T"" = T
- ""F|(T) = T"" = T

From the above steps, ""f|(T&((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&((!T)&F))))|((T&(y|(T|((!T)&(F|F)))))|F))))"" simplifies to ""f|(T&T)"" which in turn simplifies to ""f|T"", finally yielding T. So, the next simplification becomes ""!T"".

Next, ""(b|(b&b))"" simplifies to ""(b|b)"" = b.

Also, ""(b|(b&b))|T"" simplifies to ""b|T"" = T.

Finally, the whole logical formula, ""(!(f|(T&((T|T)&((F&(x&(m&((!T)&F))))|((T&(y|(T|((!T)&(F|F)))))|F))))))|(((b|(b&b))|T)|T))"", simplifies to ""!T|T"", which yields True or T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (n&F) will always be False regardless of the value of n because False AND anything is always False. Thus, the expression simplifies to w|F.

2. w|F simplified further to w, because anything OR False is always the original value.

3. The second part of the expression is ((F|((a|T)|((!(T|((v&(v&(v&v)))|((F|(p&F))|T))))|(F|(!(T|F)))))&F). Since T OR anything is always True, (a|T) simplifies to T. Therefore, this portion reduces to (F|T), which is True. However, True AND False is always False. Thus, the entire expression simplifies to False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify some obvious things:

(F&T) will always be False because False AND anything is False.
(T&F) will always be False.
So, we simplify those parts:

((i&(!(F|(F&F)))) | (i|((i&(i|((((T&T)&F)|((((x&T)|(x|x))&x)|(F&T))|T))&(T&T))))|i))

(T&T) will always be True because True AND True is True.
This should leave us with:

((i&(!F)) | (i|((i&(i|((F|(((x&T)|(x|x))&x)|F)|T))&T))|i))

(!F) will always be True because it's NOT False.
This gives us:

((i&T) | (i|((i&(i|(F|((x&T)|(x|x))&x|F)|T))&T))|i))

As for (x|x) it will always be equal to X because anything OR the same thing is always the same thing. We have:

((i&T) | (i|((i&(i|(F|(x&T|x)&x|F)|T))&T))|i))

We further simplify (x&T|x) to x because it’s equivalent to x AND (T or x) which is simply x.

From this, we have:

((i&T) | (i|((i&(i|(F|x&x|F)|T))&T))|i))

Which becomes:

((i&T) | (i|((i&(i|(T)))&T))|i))

As i|(i|(T)) equals to i|T which is T, reduced form becomes:

((i&T) | ((T)&T))|i))

Which will further be simplified to:

((i&T) | T)|i))

And this simplifies further to

i | T,

which is always T. This is because anything OR-ed with True ALWAYS results in True. So, the simplified form of the complicated logical expression is just T or True.",T,i

a) h|h = h (Or identity law: P OR P = P)
b) (h&T) = h (And Identity law: P AND T = P)
c) (h|(h&T)) = h (Absorption law: P OR (P AND Q) = P)
d) ((g|T)|(T|F)) = T (Domination law: P OR T = T and Also, Complement law: P OR (NOT P) = T, Using both these laws, we get T)
e) T&(!F) = T (Complement law: P AND (NOT P) = F, in this case, P is F. So, !F = T. Hence, T AND T = T.)
f) F|T = T (Domination law - As discussed before)
g) h&T = h (And Identity law: P AND T = P)
h) Therefore, (((h|h)&T)&(h&((h|(h&T))&(F|T))&(!F))) = h

2. We can simplify a|(((!F)&T)|F) to T.

Because:
a) ((!F)&T) = T (As discussed previously, !F = T. So, T AND T = T)
b) T|F = T (Using Domination law)

Replacing each of these instances in the formula, we get:

((!((F&((o|F)|o)&(F|((T|(m&F))&((T&F)|T)))&F))|(F|(h&F))).

Next, anything OR with F will always result in the initial expression, so (o|F) becomes o, (T&F) would be F, any expression OR with T will always result in T, and any expression AND with F will always result in F.

Applying these properties, we get:

((!(F&o&F))|(F|(h&F)) = (!(F))|(F|F) = (!F)|(F)

2. Any expression ORed with False (F | AnyExpression) will be just AnyExpression, because False will not impact the output.

3. Any expression ANDed with True (AnyExpression & T) will be just AnyExpression, because True will not change the output.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","From the logical constants, we know:

1) T&T = T,  T|F = T,

= F | T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any proposition logic formula combined with False using logical or (|), returns the same proposition logic formula (i.e., p | F = p). And anything combined with True using logical or (|), returns True (i.e., p | T = T).
2. Any proposition logic formula combined with False using logical and (&), results in False (i.e., p & F = F). And anything combined with True using logical and (&), returns itself (i.e., p & T = p).
3. Logical not (!) applied on True (T) gives False (F) i.e., !T = F and vice versa (!F = T)
4. From 1st point, z&(z&z) = z and z&T = z. Also, logical or (|) operation of any proposition logic formula with True returns True i.e., z | T = T.
5. From 2nd point, the whole term (l|F)|T is T and combining this with False using logical and gives False. So, ((l|F)|T)&F = F. Similarly, the whole term (F|(((l|F)|T)&F)) equals to F. Applying logical not (!) on this results in True i.e., F | ((l|F)|T)&F) = True and !(True) = False. Thus, the term (!(T|(!(((F|(((l|F)|T)&F))&(((z&(z&z))&T)|T))&F))))) = False.
6. Any proposition logic formula combined with True using logical or (|) gives True  i.e, j | j = j and then j | F = j. Also, j and j (j & j) gives j (i.e., j & j = j). Applying logical or with True on j (i.e., j | T) gives True. Now, combine p with True using logical and operation gives p i.e., p & True = p. Thus, the term (p&((j&((j|j)|F))|T)) = p.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's clarify a few rules of Boolean algebra:

1. T | x = T (True OR anything = True)
2. F | x = x (False OR anything = the value of the anything)
3. T & x = x (True AND anything = the value of the anything)
4. F & x = F (False AND anything = False)
5. Not(T) = F (NOT True = False)
6. Not(F) = T (NOT False = True)

Now start simplifying the expression:

The expression is: 

((x&(F|(F&(!(!((v|(!(y&(!(!F)))))&(!((F&(T&(F&T)))&F))))))))&(((!((!(T|F))|T))&T)&T))

Let's break down from inside:

- y&(!(!F)) is equivalent to y&True = y
- !(y) will be simplifications of the opposite of y
- v|(!y) will be 'v or not y'
  
Then, moving forward:

- we have (F&(T&(F&T))) = F (using rule 4)
- !F will be T (using rule 6)
- Then we get to (!T) = F (using rule 5)
- v|(!y)&F = F

The first large expression simplifies to (x&F) = F (using rule 4)

Pushing to the other side:

- !(T|F) = !(T) = F (using rule 5)
- !F = T (using rule 6)
- (T&T) = T

The full expression therefore simplifies to F&T = F (using rule 4), which is the final answer.",F,F

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify the innermost brackets. 

The formula (F & F) simplifies to F (false & false = false).
The formula (F | T) simplifies to T (false | true = true).
The formula (T | T | T) simplifies to T (true | true = true).
The formula (F | T) simplifies to T (false | true = true).

We replace these in the original, and we get:

(w | (w | (w | (f & F) | (w & (! (q | T) | T))))) & ((!F) | F) | T.

Next, we simplify the following:

The formula (f & F) simplifies to F.
The formula !F simplifies to T.
The formula ((!(q | T)) | T) simplifies to T because anything OR'd with true equals true. 

We input these findings back into the original statement and get:

(w | (w | (w | F | (w & T)))) & (T | F) | T.

Simplify next:

The formula (w & T) simplifies to w because anything AND'd with true equals the original value.
The formula (T | F) simplifies to T.

Placing these back into the original formula:

(w | (w | (w | F | w))) & T | T.

We simplify this to:

(w | w | w | F | w) & T | T which simplifies to (w | F) & T | T.

The formula (w | F) simplifies to w and we input this back into previous simplification:

(w & T) | T simplifies to w | T.

The final simplified formula is w | T. 

Since anything OR'd with true is always true, the final simplification of formula is T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T&((a|T)&T) simplifies to (T&T) which gives T since a|T will be always True, so we get T.
2. F|(F|(F|T)) simplifies to F|T which results in T because OR operation with True results in True.
3. So, (F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T simplifies to T&T which equals T because AND operation with True and True results in True.
4. ((F|F)&T) simplifies to F&T which gives F since AND operation with False results in False.
5. So, we get F|(F&!(F&T)) which simplifies to F|F equals F
6. The whole formula now looks like -
(o|(o&(o&(T|F)))|((v|(e|(T|(f&F))))|T))
7. T|F simplifies to T and F&F simplifies to F
8. The whole formula simplifies to -
(o|(o&(o&T))|((v|(e|T|F))|T)) 
9. o&T simplifies to o since AND operation with any entity with True results in that entity only.
10. The whole formula simplifies to -
(o|o|((v|(e|T|F))|T))
11. e|T|F simplifies to e|T equals to T
12. The whole formula simplifies to -
(o|o|(v|T|T)) which equals to (o|T) which ultimately simplifies to T since OR operation with True results in True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we know that T&F and F&T (true AND false) always gives F (false), and F&F (false AND false) gives F as well. This means parts like ((F&((!T)&T)), or (F|((F&(F|((((o|o)|o)&F) gets simplified to F.

Then we know that !T (not true) is F, and (F|T) and (!((F&F) are T. This means parts like ((!T)&T) get simplified to F.

We also know that o|o (or any variable OR itself) is just the variable itself, and something OR false is just the variable again, and something AND false is false, so part like (((o|o)|o)&F simplify to F.
 
Then another thing to note is that for any values A, (A|T) is always true (T). 

So the entire formula simplifies as follows:

((y|(T&F))|(((F|F)&T)&F)) = ((y|F)|((F&T)&F)) = (y|(F&F)) = (y|F) = y. 

So, the simplified answer is y.",y,y
