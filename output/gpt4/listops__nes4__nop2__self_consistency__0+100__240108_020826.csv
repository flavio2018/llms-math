- [MIN 2 7] returns the minimum number between 2 and 7, so it is 2.
- [MIN 7 7] returns the minimum number between 7 and 7, so it is 7.
- [SM 2 7] returns the sum of 2 and 7 modulo 10, so it is 9 (because 2+7 is 9 and the remainder when 9 is divided by 10 is 9).
- [MAX 2 6] returns the maximum number between 2 and 6, so it is 6.
- [MIN 1 4] returns the minimum number between 1 and 4, so it is 1.
- [SM 6 3] returns the sum of 6 and 3 modulo 10, so it is 9 (because 6+3 is 9 and the remainder when 9 is divided by 10 is 9).

So, we can replace everything to get:

- [MIN 9 6] returns the minimum number between 9 and 6, so it is 6.

   - SM [SM 5 5] [MAX 7 8]. Here, SM 5 5 equals 0 (as the sum is 10, which is equivalent to 0 in modulo 10), MAX 7 8 equals 8. Hence, the operation turns into SM 0 8, which gives 8.
   - Now, the first big bracket turns into MAX 9 8, which equals 9.

Next, calculate the other brackets:
   - SM [SM [SM 8 8] [SM 3 8]] [SM [MAX 5 7] [MAX 2 8]]. 
   - The inner-most SM operations give SM 8 8 equals 6 (since 16 modulo 10 equals 6) and SM 3 8 equals 1 (since 11 modulo 10 equals 1). Thus, we have SM [SM 6 1] [SM [MAX 5 7] [MAX 2 8]].
   - Then we find SM 6 1 equals 7 and MAX 5 7 equals 7, MAX 2 8 equals 8. Hence, we get SM 7 [SM 7 8] equals SM 7 5 (since 15 modulo 10 is 5) which finally gives 2 (as 12 modulo 10 equals 2).

[SM 6 9] is (6+9) mod 10 = 5,
[SM 2 8] is (2+8) mod 10 = 0,

[SM 3 7] is (3+7) mod 10 = 0,

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, for [MIN 1 7] we get 1 and for [SM 9 2], we get 1 (since 9+2 = 11, and 11 modulo 10 is 1). So [MAX [MIN 1 7] [SM 9 2]] becomes [MAX 1 1], which is 1.

For [SM 6 6], we get 2 (since 12 modulo 10 is 2) and [MAX 9 0] is 9. So [MAX [SM 6 6] [MAX 9 0]] becomes [MAX 2 9], which equals to 9.

[SM [SM [MAX 3 8] [MAX [SM 6 7] [MAX 4 3]]] [MAX [MIN 7 6] [MAX [MIN 8 4] [MAX 7 9]]]].

Next, we evaluate the remaining expressions within the next innermost brackets:

MAX 3 8 = 8
SM 6 7 = 3 (since 13 is over 10, we take modulo 10, it's 3)
MAX 4 3 = 4

MAX 7 9 = 9

So, your equation now becomes:

Keep evaluating:

MAX 3 4 = 4	
MAX 4 9 = 9

Now, our expression is as follows:

[SM [SM 8 4] [MAX 6 9]].

Evaluate it further:

SM 8 4 = 2 (since 12 is over 10, we take modulo 10, it's 2)

- [MAX 8 2] = 8
- [MAX [MIN 7 0] [MAX 8 2]] = [MAX 0 8] = 8
- [SM 9 3] = 2 (since the sum modulo 10 of 9 and 3, which is 12, is 2)

- [MIN [MAX [MIN 7 0] [MAX 8 2]] [MAX [SM 9 3] [MIN 8 4]]] = [MIN 8 4] = 4

Now we calculate the second part of expression:

- [MAX 5 9] = 9
- [MAX 6 3] = 6
- [SM [MAX 5 9] [MAX 6 3]] = [SM 9 6] = 5 (since the sum modulo 10 of 9 and 6, which is 15, is 5)

- [MAX [SM [MAX 5 9] [MAX 6 3]] [MIN [MIN 4 5] [SM 2 9]]] = [MAX 5 1] = 5

After this step, the result is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First calculate the SM (sum modulo 10) operations: 
- SM [2 8] = 0 
- SM [4 7] = 1 
- SM [6 5] = 1 
- SM [1 9] = 0 
- SM [5 3] = 8
- SM [2 0] = 2
- SM [1 1] = 2

Now substitute these values back into the expression:
[MAX [MIN [0 1] [1 0]] [SM [MIN [8 7] [2 2]]]] 

Next calculate the MIN (minimum) and MAX (maximum) operations:
- MIN [0 1] = 0
- MAX [1 0] = 1
- MIN [8 7] = 7
- MAX [2 2] = 2

Substitute these values back into the expression:
[MAX [0 1] [SM [7 2]]] 

Do the final SUM operation 
- SM [7 2] = 9

Finish by doing the final MAX operation 
- MAX [0 1 9] = 9

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Calculate all SM (sum modulo 10) operations:
    SM 9 2 = 1 (because 9+2=11, and 11 modulo 10 equals 1)
    SM 7 5 = 2 (because 7+5=12, and 12 modulo 10 equals 2)
    SM [MIN 6 3] [MAX 6 5] gives SM 3 6, which is 9 (because 3+6=9)
    SM [MAX 4 4] [MIN 8 2] gives SM 4 2, which is 6 (because 4+2=6)
    SM [MAX 4 1] [MAX 5 6] gives SM 4 6, which is 0 (because 4+6=10, and 10 modulo 10 equals 0)

2. After the first step, our expression simplifies to:
    [MAX [SM [MIN 1 2] 9] [MIN 6 0]]

3. Let's perform remaining MIN, MAX operations:
    [MAX 1 9] equals 9
    [MIN 6 0] equals 0

4. After the second step, out expression simplifies to:

[MAX 5 4] = 5,

Now, solve the new expressions inside the brackets:

[MAX 6 0] = 6,
[MAX 7 2] = 7,
[MIN 5 1] = 1.

Updating the expression, we get:

[MIN [SM 6 7] [SM 1 4]].

Now, let's keep going:
MIN 0 6 = 0
MAX 3 7 = 7
MAX 1 4 = 4
MAX 7 1 = 7
