Since q or False is q (since if q is true, the result is true and if q is false, the result is false), the formula simplifies to: ((q&T)&(j|(!F))).

Now, the logical not operator ! flips the truth value of the operand. Therefore, !F is T. This transforms the formula into: (q&T)&(j|T).

Next step: T&F simplifies to F since True and False gives us False. 

So, you get F|T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First of all, we simplify the expression inside the parenthesis (h|F)|h. The value of ""F OR anything"" is always the value of ""anything"", in this case ""h"". Therefore, h|F in this expression can be replaced by h. Which becomes:

The expression T&F is ""false"", since ""true AND false"" is ""false"".
Then, logically NOT(false) is ""true"". Hence, (!T&(F&T)) is ""false"" and then NOT(false) is ""true"".
