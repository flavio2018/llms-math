- Since it's positive, compute the modulo 100: 12 mod 100 = 12
The final answer is 12.",12,12
99,arithmetic,self_consistency,((35*-23)*(63-80)),"Q: Solve the following arithmetic expression computing the modulo 100 of each intermediate value if it's positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative:
((35*-23)*(63-80)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the product of 35 and -23 which is -805.

Because this value is negative, find modulo -100 which gives us -5.

Next, calculate the difference between 63 and 80 which is -17. Because this value is negative, find modulo -100 which gives us -17.

Finally, multiply -5 and -17 together to get 85. 

So, the solution to the expression is 85.",85,85
