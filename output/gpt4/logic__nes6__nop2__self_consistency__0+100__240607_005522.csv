- F | T is always T, because anything OR True will always yield True. 
- F & T we established above as false.

(i & T) is the same thing as i because anything AND True will always yield the original value.
(T & (c & F)) simplifies to (T & F) because anything AND False is always False.
(T & F) simplifies further to F because anything AND False is always False.

!T = F (because NOT T is F)

1. (!(F|(T|F))):

2. (a&T)&T

Applying these simplifications, the original expression becomes ((a|a)&(T&False)|!T). 

This can be further simplified:

1. (a|a) can be simplified to 'a', because something OR'd with itself is just itself.
2. (T&False) results in False.
3. !T translates to 'Not T', which is False.

- (F|T) will also be T because anything OR True is True.
- (!(T)) will be F because NOT True is False.

""T&F"" is F (True AND False is always False), so replace ""T&F"" with F:

Now, the expression (T&T) is equivalent to T (since T and T is T) and (T&F) is F (since T and F is F). The expression (F|T) is equivalent to T (since T or F is T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, (!T) will be False, and therefore (!T|T) will be True, since False or True is always True.
Hence, simplify the formula as follows:

Now, r AND True is always r, so this further simplifies to:

((((r&T)&r)|r)|F)&r)|(r&r&r)

Since r and r and r is just r, revise the formula as:

((((r&T)&r)|r)|F)&r)|r

Next, r AND T is always r, and r OR F is also r, we can abbreviate this to:

(r&r|r)&r|r

Given that r AND r yields r, and r OR r is also r, the formula simplifies further to:

Substituting these into the logic formula gives us:
((T&(T|F))|(F&F)).

Then, the AND operation with True (T&X) basically means itself (X). So, (T&(T|F)) simplifies to T because True AND anything is itself (if X is True) or False (if X is False). 

On the other hand, the AND operation with False (F&X) gives us False regardless of what X represents. So, (F&F) simplifies to F.

So we have: 

(T|F).

The OR operation with False (|F) just gives us what is in the other operand. So, (T|F) simplifies to T because True OR anything is True. 

So the original logic formula simplifies to T (True).",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, any statement OR'd (|) with TRUE (T) is always TRUE. So T|T simplifies to T.

2. The AND(&) operation with T and F results in F. So T&F simplifies to F.

3. The NOT(!) operation negates the value of the expression it is applied to. So, the NOT of a FALSE (F) value is a TRUE (T) value. So !(T&F) which equals (!F) simplifies to T.

4. Also, any statement AND'd (&) with FALSE (F) is always FALSE, and any statement OR'd(|) with TRUE is always TRUE.

2. Anything AND False is equal to False. So, (T&F) is equal to F.

4. Anything OR True is True. Therefore, ((False|T)|((d|T)|F)) simplifies to True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify (!F)|F and (b|F)|b parts, as a logical OR operation with False (F) does not affect the output, and AND operation (!F AND F) with False gives always False.

Further, (F&F) gives us value False (F) as well. Therefore, formula becomes:
