A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's identify the constant values:

The logic operation `&` which represents logical ""and"" is such that T&T = T (True and True results in True), and F&F = F (False and False results in False). From this, we can identify that any variable & T will result in the same variable (x&T = x), whereas any variable & F will result in False (x&F = F).

The logic operation `|` which represents logical ""or"" is such that T|F = T (True or False results in True), and F|T = T (False or True results in True). From this, we could identify that any variable | T will result in True (x|T = T), whereas any variable | F will result in the same variable (x|F = x).

In the equation given,

- (x&x) is simplified to x (since any variable logically ""anded"" with itself will always be itself).

- (s&(F&F)) becomes (s&F) which simplifies to F (since any variable logically ""anded"" with False becomes False).

So our logical formula simplifies, as follows:

(((i&i)|(t|T))|(!T)) -> (((i&i)|T)|F).
 
Secondly, the expression (i&i) just evaluates to i, because an entity logically ANDed with itself is always equal to itself.

So this further simplifies our logical formula, as follows:

2) In logic, anything AND True is just itself. So, b&T reduces to just b. Also, (T|F) reduces to True since T OR anything is T. So, the expression reduces to:

(b&(i|T)).

3) Anything OR True is True, so i|T reduces to True. This reduces the expression to:

b&True.

4) As we have seen before, anything ""&"" True is just itself. So, in the end, the expression simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, the not of F (!F) is T, because not False equals True. Thus, the expression becomes: (q&T)&((T|T)|T).

Next, (T|T) is T, because True OR True equals True. The same goes for (T|T). This simplifies the expression to: (q&T)&T.

Lastly, anything AND True is itself. Therefore, the continuation simplifies the formula to just q. Thus, the formula simplifies to q.",q,q

(((s&s)|s)&(s&(T|T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In the given logic formula, `(((s&s)|s)&(s&(T|T)))`, we have T|T equals T (since either side of the OR is true). Hence we have:

`(((s&s)|s)&(s&T))`

Both sides of an AND operation have to be true in order for the entire operation to be counted as true. Thus `s&T` simplifies to `s` (since T is always true, this operation is true only if s is true).

So the above simplifies to:

`(((s&s)|s)&s)`

`s&s` equals `s` (an element ANDed with itself is just the element itself), so we have:

`((s|s)&s)`

Again  `s|s` equals `s`, so we are left with:

`(s&s)`

Finally, `s&s` equals `s` (an element ANDed with itself is just the element itself), hence the simplified version of given logic formula `(((s&s)|s)&(s&(T|T)))` is:

`s`",s,s

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. For any value X, X & X is always X. So (n & n) simplifies to n, and (s & s) simplifies to s. 
2. Any value AND False is always False. So, (s & F) simplifies to F.

So, the simplified formula is: (n & n) | F, which further simplifies to n | F.

Finally, any value OR False is always the value itself.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, starting from the left:
1. (!F) equals T (as not false equals true).
2. So, ((!F)|(F|T)) simplifies to (T|(F|T)).
3. (F|T) equals T as an operation of logical or where at least one option is true will always yield true.
4. So, (T|(F|T)) simplifies to (T|T), which equals T (because logical or between two true values is true).
5. Then, look at the right operation: (T&F) equals F, because logical and between true and false is false.
6. So, ((T)|(F|T))&(T&F) simplifies to T&F, which equals F. 

So, the entire expression simplifies to F.",F,F

(((!T)|(T&T))|(T&F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, evaluate the ""!T"", ""T&T"" and ""T&F"" operators:

* ""!T"" means ""not True,"" which is False.

* ""T&T"" means ""True and True,"" which is True.

* ""T&F"" means ""True and False,"" which is False.

Substitute these values back to the original expression:

(((False)|(True))|(False)).

Then calculate expression between brackets: 

""False|True"" equals to True (because one of the conditions is true). 

So, the simplified form of the logic formula is:

(True|False).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the (T&T) to T, which stands for true. It's a tautology, as two truth values connected by thelogical ""and"" operator always give true as output. 

So, the equation simplifies to ((c|F)|(c|F)&T). 

Still, it can be broken down. (c|F) is the same as c because the logical ""or"" operator with 1 True and 1 False always gives the first operand as output. 

So, the formula simplifies to c|c&T.

We can simplify further. The logical ""and"" operator with True and any other element gives that element as output, meaning c&T equals to c.

Therefore, the formula becomes c|c which simplifies to c, because the logical ""or"" operator with similar elements gives that element as output. 

Thus, the simplified logic formula for ((c|F)|((c|F)&(T&T))) is c.",c,c

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The formula ((y|(y|y))&(y|(y&T))) simplifies as follows.

The proposition (y|y) is equivalent to just 'y' because the OR operation between the same proposition doesn't change its value. Thus, (y|(y|y)) simplifies to (y|y) which further simplifies to 'y'.

The proposition (y&T) is equivalent to 'y' if 'T' is true and 'F' if 'T' is false. Since we don't know what the value of 'T' is, let's just simplify it to y assuming that 'T' is true. Thus, (y|(y&T)) simplifies to (y|y) which further simplifies to 'y'.
