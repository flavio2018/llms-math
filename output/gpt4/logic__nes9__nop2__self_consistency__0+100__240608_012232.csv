!(!T) is same as T because double negation reverses the effect:

So, (m|(F|(!T))) simplifies to (m|F), because (F|(!T)) equals F. This then simplifies again to m, because when anything is or'ed with False, the result is simply that thing.

Now, let's look at (!(T|F)) which is equal to !(T|F). This simplifies to False because not (T or F) equals not True, which is False.

Notice that every time we're and'ing with false, like (((((p&T)|T)&(!(T|F)))|T)&F), the result is False. This is because anything and'ed with False equals False.

So, the whole expression simplifies to:

((T&F)&(m&T)&(T&F)), since all of the parentheses and expressions involving a & and False reduce to False. Which finally simplifies to:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider the operations within the brackets. Here are some basic laws of Boolean algebra that you may find helpful:
1. Logical Operator NOT (!): !(T) = F,  !(F) = T
2. Logical Operator AND (&): (T&F) = F, (F&T) = F, (T&T) = T, (F&F) = F
3. Logical Operator OR (|): (T|F) = T, (F|T) = T, (T|T) = T, (F|F) = F
4. Anything AND false i.e (X&F) will always be false
5. Anything OR true i.e (X|T) will always be true
6. Double NOT i.e !!X will be X

So, we can start simplifying the formula based on these rules:

1. Simplify ((T|F)|(c&F)):
   - (T|F) simplifies to T because it means True OR False which will always be true.
   - Similarly, (c&F) simplifies to F because it means something AND False which is always false.
   - Finally we have (T|F) which again simplifies to T.

2. Simplify (((r|((f&((((T|F)|(c&F))&T)|F))&F))|r):
   - As we derived from step 1, the formula simplifies to ((r|((f&T&F)&F))|r)
   - This simplifies to ((r|(F&F))|r) because (f&T&F) is equal to F.
   - Further simplifications: ((r|F)|r) and then (r|r) and finally r.

3. Simplify (F&(F&((f&(!(!(T|T))))&F))):

In this case, (!(F&(((F|T)|F)&T)) simplifies to !(F) because F&anything is F and !(F) is T. 

So, ((d|(T&(T&((z|(z&(!(p&F))))&F))))|(F&((!T)|F))) simplifies to:

Next, (!(p&F)) also simplifies to T, because F&anything is F and !(F) is T. So, we have:

((d|(T&(T&((z|(z&(T))&F))))|(F&((!T)|F))) simplifies to:

In this case, (z&(T))&F simplifies to F because anything&F is F. 

So, ((d|(T&(T&(z&F))))|(F&((!T)|F))) simplifies to:

This gives us ((d|(T&(T&F)))|(F&F)) which simplifies to:

((d|(T&F))|F) simplifies to:

- (F|T) is always equal to T (True), as False OR True is always True.
- (w|w) is always equal to w, as w OR w is always w.
- (i|i), is always equal to i, as i OR i is always i.
- (i|F) is always equal to i (i OR False is always i).
- (e&((w|w)|((i|(i|F))|(F|(F|T))))) simplify down to (he&(w|i|T)), as we replace:
  - (w|w) by w
  - (i|(i|F)) by i
  - (F|(F|T)) by T
- (T&T) is always equal to T (True), as True AND True is always True.
- (z&F) is always equal to F (False), as any value AND False is always False.

This simplifies the formula to:

(((s|F)&((z&F)|((e&(w|i|T))|(g|T))))&T), then we can further simplify:

- (s|F) will always be equal to s, as anything OR False is the value itself.
- ((z&F)|((e&(w|i|T))|(g|T))), replace any False value by F:
  - As we know (z&F) is equal to F, this simplifies to (F|((e&(w|i|T))|(g|T))).
  - As we know that any value OR True is always True, replacing (g|T) by T gives us (F|((e&(w|i|T))|T)).
- The formula becomes ((s|F)&(F|((e&(w|i|T))|T)))&T), which simplifies to (s&(F|((e&(w|i|T))|T)))&T.

As the logical AND operator takes precedence, we can remove the threatening brackets, which simplifies the formula to:

- As any value AND True is the value itself, we simplify further to s&F|s&e&w|i|T,
- Since any value AND False is always False, we simplify the first part of our expression to F,
- The final simplified result is: F|s&e&w|i|T.

To make the formula more clear, it can be expressed as: F OR ((s AND e AND w AND i) OR T). It's important to note that because OR prevail over AND this formula is always True regardless to the value of the literals s, e, w or i.",T,s

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify each operation:
Notice that T&F equates to False, as anything AND-ed with False is False.
!T&F = !False = True.
So t|(!T&F) becomes t|True = True.

Next, T|F = True, because anything OR-ed with True is True.
This implies that T&F&T = True, as anything AND-ed with True is True.
So, all of ((((T|F)|T)&T)|((T|((F|(F|F))|(T|(!F))))&F)) simplifies to True.

Finally, even (((z|True)&T) simplifies to True since anything OR-ed with True is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we will simplify inner brackets. The result of (F|F) will be ""F"". And 'F' & 'Not F' will also give us 'F'. Therefore, 'T' | 'F' simplifies to ""T"".
So our expression is ((v&(T&(((T|F)|F)|((T&F)|T))))&(!((T|F)&F))).

Again, in the expression ((T|F)|F), 'T' or 'F' gives us ""T"". So it simplifies to ""T"". Hence the expression after simplification is ((v&(T&(T|((T&F)|T))))&(!((T|F)&F))).

When we see (T&F) which simplifies to ""F"" (since both conditions need to be true for a logical AND to give true), our expression is left with ((v&(T&(T|(F|T))))&(!((T|F)&F))).

'T' or 'F' gives us 'T'. Hence the simplified expression is ((v&(T&(T|T)))&(!((T|F)&F))).

'T' or 'T' simplifies to ""T"", thus the expression becomes ((v&(T&T))&(!((T|F)&F))).

'T' and 'T' gives ""T"". Therefore, we get ((v&T)&!((T|F)&F)).

Again simplify !(T|F) to !T (since 'T' or 'F' gives 'T'), we get ((v&T)&(!T&F)).

'Not T' will be 'F'. So, F&F gives 'F'. The expression becomes ((v&T)&F).

Finally, 'v' and 'T' gives 'v' and 'v' and 'F' gives 'F'. Hence the original boolean expression is simplified down to 'F'.",F,v

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T is always true and F is always false. Hence, the inner formulas (such as !F and F) simplify to T and F, respectively. So, the expression comes down to: 

((!(F|((!(F&(((j&j)|j)&F)))|(v|((!(T))&F)|T)))&(!(T&(d|T)))))

2. Any literal (like j or v) anded with false (F) results in false, so ((j&j)|j)&F simplifies to F. Hence: 

((!(F|((!(F&F))|(v|((!(T))&F)|T)))&(!(T&(d|T)))))

3. Since F&F gives F and the not of a false (F) gives us true, the expression simplifies to: 

((!(F|(T)|(v|((!(T))&F)|T))&(!(T&(d|T))))

4. The not of true (T) gives false (F). Hence: 

((!(F|T|v|(F)|T))&(!(T&(d|T)))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First let's analyze (T&F), it is going to result in F, because logical 'and' operation requires both operands to be true to return true. But in this case, we have one true and one false. 

2. Now let's see (a&(a|(a|a))). The 'or' operation in (a|a) will return a itself, because a logical 'or' operation between two same values will result in that same value. So it simplifies to (a&a&a&a) which means (a&a) which is a.

3. The next is (((T)&a)&F), which will be a & F which results in F, because, as explained before, a logical 'and' with false results in false.

4. Then, ((F|F)&F)&F simplifies to F & F which is F.

5. Now, (!F) becomes T, because the 'not' operation inverts the truth value.

6. In the next steps, we work with ((F|F)&(!(F|(T|(i&F))))). This one will be just F & !F. Which is F, again due to the logical 'and' operation.

7. ((F|F)&(!(F|(T|(i&F))))) simplifies to F so now we have F & F, and considering 'and' operation, it again gives us F.

    The (T&F) also results to F for the same reason as above;
    Therefore, the results will be: !(!F), which is T.

3. The formula becomes (((T|T)|F)&(!(!T)))|(T|F)

4. Then, the ((T|T)|F) equals to T, because T or anything is always T;

5. Then, (!(!T) equals to T, because double negation;

6. Therefore, the formula becomes (T&T)|(T|F)

7. The (T&T) equals to T, because T and T always equal T;

8. The (T|F) equals to T, because T or anything always equal T;

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we have a conjunction of two similar clause ""q|q"", which boils down to just ""q"" because a value or-ed with itself remains itself.

Secondly, we'll simplify ""!((h|(F|(F&T)))|T)"".
The expression inside the parenthesis simplifies as follows:
""F&T"" will always be ""F"" because False and anything will be ""False.""
So, now the expression becomes ""(h|(F|F))|T"", which boils down to ""h|T"".
Since ""h"" is either ""T"" or ""F"", using the law of total probability (""T"" or ""F"" is ""T""), thus ""h|T"" will be ""T"".
Now, negating ""T"" i.e., ""!(T)"" will be ""F"".

Moving on to ""(T&(!(T|(!T))))&F"".
The expression inside the parenthesis simplifies as follows:
As per the law of inverse ""!T"" is ""F"", so the inner expression becomes ""T|F"".
According to the law of excluded middle, ""T|F"" will be ""T"".
Thus, ""!T"" will be ""F"".
Consequently, ""(T&F)&F"" which simplifies to ""F&F"" and this results in ""F"".

Lastly, ""(F|F)"" will be ""F"".

So, the expression simplifies to ""q&((T|T)&F)&F"", which is ""q&F&F"", and according to the Bitcoin rule, ""q&F"" will be ""F"". Hence, the entire expression simplifies to ""F"".",F,F

    So the formula is now (((T&(F&F))&(!((!(T&((u|(T|T))&T)))|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T)))))|(F)).

2. Similarly, (T|T) results to True, replacing it. 
    The formula becomes (((T&False)&(!((!(T&((u|True)&T)))|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T)))))|F)).

3. Then we have (u|True) that results to True. That can be also exchanged.
    Now we have (((T&False)&(!((!(T&True))|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T)))))|F)).

4. (T&True) corresponds to T. Put it back to the formula.
    Now we have (((T&False)&(!((!T)|(!((((h&T)&F)|T)&T)))))|F)).

5. Observe that (h&T)&F - h being T or F, this expression always will be F. Similarly, F|T will be T. Replace them in the formula.
    Now we have (((T&False)&(!((!T)|(!(T&T)))))|F)).

6. (T&T) is T, so ((!(T&T)) is F. With (!(!T) further simplifying to T.
    So, finally, we get (((T&False)&(T|F))|F)).

7. Notice that T&False and T|F result to F and T correspondingly.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify expressions from the inner parentheses with having only True and False values (or operations with False):

(((o&o)&(n&F))|F)  ->  (F|F)  ->  F
((F&F)|T)  -> (F|T) -> T
(((a&a)|F) & ...) -> (a & ...)
(F|F) -> F

The formula from the initial parentheses after these simplifications will have the following format:

(a|(...&(!F)))&(T&(!F)). 

All with applying the logic that (any logic argument & False) gives a result of False, and (any logic argument|False) gives a result of the same logic argument.

Then we consider next operations with only True values:

...&(!F) -> ...&T

The logic of this operation says that (any logic argument & True) gives a result with the same logic argument.

(a|...) & (T & (!F)) looks like so far (a|...) & T, where ... is something from logical operations.

Finally, we solve T&(!F) which gives T (because this involves negation of False and combining with True: True & True gives True).

So far the simplified formula looks like this:

(a|(...)) & T.

Using the logic behind that (any logic argument & True) equals to the same logic argument, we can simplify this further to just (a|(...)).

Finally by substitifying the value of ..., which is the logical NOT of False value, that results in True. 

So, the final result and the simplification of initial complex logical expression gives us: a|True. 

This in turn, by final use of logical OR operation (any logic argument | True) simplifies down to True. This is the result, and it means that the whole complex expression will always be true for any values of a, o, and n.",T,a

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider (T&F). The ""and"" operator means that both sides would have to be true for the whole expression to be true. True with False is always False. Thus, (T & F) can be replaced with F.

Also, (F | F) is an ""or"" operation, which is true if either is true. But both are False. Thus, (F | F) can be replaced with F.

Similarly, (((!T) | (F & F))) is a combination of not, or, and and. The not(!) operator flips the value, so !T becomes False. The ""and"" operator in (F & F) is False. Overall, it is False or False, which is False. Thus, (((!T) | (F & F))) can be replaced with F. 

Hence, the original equation - ((((w & w) & ((T & F) | ((T & ((F | F) | T)) | ((!((!T) | (F & F))) & F)))) & (!F)) & (T & F)) - simplifies to:

w & (T | (T | !F)) & F, because ""w & w"" equals ""w"", ""T & ((F | F) | T) equals T | F | T"" equals T and ""(!((!T) | (F & F))) & F"" equals F & F equals F.

Finally, the ""not"" operator flips F to T, and the whole equation simplifies to:

w & T & F.

But as stated earlier, ""T & F"" equals F, hence the final simplification to: 

w & F.

This expression will be False no matter what boolean value w takes. So, the simplified logic formula is F (False).",F,F

Additionally, the expression ""T&(k|(T|(T&T)))"" simplifies to ""T&k"", because 'T' (True) is the identity of ""or"" operation, and the result is the other expression if one of expression is 'T' (True).

With these three simplifications, the formula can be rewritten as:

- Therefore, ((T|F)&F) becomes (T&F) which is F.
- Meanwhile, (T|((T|F)|((T|F)&(k|T)))) is (T|(T|((T|F)&(k|T)))) which is T since T or anything is always T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, and foremost, the `T` (True) symbol can be ignored in `&` (and) operations, because it doesn't change the result and `F` (False) can be ignored in `|` (or) operations for the same reason. Simultaneously, `F` (False) in `&` (and) operations and `T` (True) in `|` (or) operations would just immediately declare the result, which also simplifies calculation.

Then, it can be noticed that `p | p & p` is equivalent to `p` (A statement ORed with that same statement ANDed with itself is still just that statement). Also `!(!F)` simply negates `F` twice which results in `F` again.

We can also notice ``e&F` is `F` because `AND` with `F` is `F`. Furthermore, `T|(t|t)&F` evaluates `T` because `OR` with `T` gives `T`.

So, substituting and solving further, we obtain `F OR F` in a subexpression, which is `F` and substituting in the original expression gives `F & T` in another subexpression which gives `F`.

Using these transformations, the formula simplifies as follows, step-by-step:

`(((T&(((((p|(p&p))&(T&(e&F)))|F)|F)&(F|(!(!F)))))&T)&(T|((t|t)&F)))`

= `((p & F | F) & F & T) & T`
 
= `(F & F & T) & T`

= `(F & T) & T`

= `F & T`

= `F`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's simplify the inner sub-formulae of the formula and replace them with known values:

2. ""(F|T)"" equals to True 
3. ""(!F)"" equals to True  ""(!T)"" equals to False
4. ""(F & F)"" equals to False, so ""(T | (F & F))"" equals to True, 
   hence ""(!((F|T)&(F&F)))"" equals to False and ""l|(!((F|T)&(F&F)))"" equals to l.

   and ""(T | (T | (F | !F))))|(!(l|(!((F|T)&((F&F))))))"" equals to True as well.

Substituting the simplified sub-formulae back into the original formula gives: ((f&(f|F))&(F|(True))). Since F | True equals to True, the formula can be simplified further to: ((f&f)&True) which simplifies to: f & f which is equal to f.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify !T (not True); it results in False. Thus, k|(!T) simplifies to k or False, which simply equals to k because ""or False"" does not change the original value.

Next, we simplify ((F|F)|F)&F), which is equivalent to F & F because False ""or"" with anything is False. Thus, ""F & F"" is also False.

So the whole part (((s|s)|((k|k|k))&(T&F))|s)&s gets simplified this way:
We replace k|k|k with k, and T&F with False,
so it goes like this: ((s|s)|(k & False))&s,

- w&(w&w) simplifies to w (since w AND w AND w is same as w AND w which is w)

Applying these reductions, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The logical union (|) or logical AND (&) with False (F) always results in False (F). Any expression is False when ANDed with False, i.e., AnyExpresion & F = F. The Unit of AND operation (&) is TRUE (T), i.e. AnyExpression & T = AnyExpression. Thus, (v & F) = F and (q & F) = F. We can reduce the formula to:
   F | ((!(T|F))|(T|F)&F)

2. The logical union (|) with True (T) always results in True, i.e., AnyExpression | T = T. Here we can't directly use the operation as none of the expressions are exactly in the form of AnyExpression | T.

3. The logical NOT (!) of False (F) and True (T) are True (T) and False (F) respectively, i.e., !F = T and !T = F.

4. The logical union (|) with False (F) always gives the other operand. Here, T|F results in T and similarly F|T results in T. Also the logical AND (&) with False (F) always results in False, i.e., AnyExpression & F = F. So T | F & F will give F. !F is T. So !(T | F) results in !T, which is F. The expression is reduced to:
   F | (F | F)

5. The logical union (|) with False (F) always gives the other operand. So, F | F results in F. The expression is simplified to the final answer:

3. 'F' OR 'T' always results in 'T', 'T' AND 'T' is 'T', 'T' AND 'NOT False' becomes 'T', and 'u' AND 'F' is 'F'. Then, the formula is simplified to ((((v&(!(T&(!F)|T)))|T)|F)&T)|((F|T)&F).

4. 'NOT False' is 'T', 'T' OR 'T' is 'T', 'F' OR 'T' is 'T', and 'T' AND ‘F’ is 'F'. This allows us to simplify the formula to ((v&(!(T|T))|T)|F)|F, which simplifies further to ((v&(!T)|T)|F)|F.

'T&(F|F))' is always False, because 'F|F' is False and 'T&F' is also False. Therefore, 'j|(T|(T&F))' simplifies to 'j|T' which is always True because 'T' is included in the 'or' operation.

Finally, ((f&((f&(f&f))|F))|((!(F|((((g|F)&((F|T)&(T|T)))|g)&(F|(F|F)))))&F)) simplifies to f | (T & F).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (F&F) simplifies to F because ""False & any value"" is always False.
2. !(F&F) simplifies to T because the negation of False is always true.
3. (T&T) simplifies to T because ""True & any value"" is always True.
4. W&W becomes just W because ""any value & the same value"" simplifies to the value itself.
5. So we are now left with (((k&T)&k)&(k&((W|(F&T|F))|T)|!T))

6. Inside the brackets ((""W|(F&T|F))|T"") T | any value always simplifies to T. So we have:

  (((k&T)&k)&(k&(W|T|T)|!T)) 

7. This now simplifies to (((k&T)&k)&(k&T|!T)) 

8. Given that any value AND true is equal to the value itself, this simplifies to:

  ((k&k)&(k&T|!T))

9. ""!!T"" is T because negation negation True is True. So, this further simplifies to:

  ((k&k)&(k|T))

10. ""Any value OR True"" simplifies to True. Also, ""any value & the same value"" simplifies to the value itself

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, understand that ""m|m"" will be the same value as ""m"" because logical or means that if any of the operands are true, the result is true. Hence, ""m|m"" is essentially ""m"". Same applies to T&T and T|T, which will result in T. 

2. Moreover, anything ""& F"" will lead to F because logical and means that both operands have to be true to result in true. If one is false (which ""F"" is), the whole thing falls apart. 

3. Similarly, anything ""| T"" will lead to T because logical or only needs one operand to be true to result in true. If one part is true (which ""T"" is), the whole thing holds. 

4. ""!T"" gives F and ""n|F"" gives n. 

5. Also, ""n & n"" simplifies to n.

((((z&(z|(F&T)))&T)&(z|(!(((h|(F|(g&F)))&((h&(h|h))|F))|T))))|(z&T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The expressions `F&T` and `g&F` will always result to False, because logical and ('&') operation with False always results in False. So, the expression simplifies to:

`((((z&(z|F))&T)&(z|(!(((h|F)&((h&h)|F))|T))))|(z&T))`.

We can now replace `z|F` with `z` and `h|F` with `h`, because logical or ('|') operation with False is always equal to the original value. Also, `h&h` can be simplified to `h` because any value logically and-ed with itself remains the same. This leads us to:

`((((z&z)&T)&(z|(!(h&T))))|(z&T))`.

Now, the expression `z&z` simplifies to `z` and `h&T` simplifies to `h` as T (True) doesn't change the value in logical and operation.

So, we end up with:

`((z&T)&(z|(!h)))|(z&T))`.

An expression `(x&y)|x` simplifies to `x` because x is both, sufficient and necessary, for x|y to be true thus the y part becomes kind of irrelevant. Applying this rule, we get:

`(z&T)&(z|(!h))`.

Finally, an expression of the form `(x&y)|(!x&y)` simplifies to `y`. Applying this to the expression we have `(z&T)|(z&(!h))`, which simplifies to `z&T`.

So, the simplified form of the given logic formula is `z&T`.",`z&T`,z

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, recall that:
- ""A & F"" is always False, no matter what A is, 
- ""A | F"" is always equal to A, no matter what A is,
- ""A | T"" is always True, no matter what A is, 
- ""!T"" is always False,
- ""!F"" is always True.

Using these rules, we can simplify the given logic formula:

Step 1: 
- T&((F&T)&F) is False, because ""A & F"" is always False, 
- (F&((T|T)|F) is False, because ""A & F"" is always False,
- (z|F) is just z, because ""A | F"" is always equal to A,
- (F|T) is True, because ""A | T"" is always True,
- !T is False. 

This leads us to the simplified version:
((F&False)&((o&((!(False)|(False))&F))&F)).

Step 2: 
- (!(False)) is True, 
- (True|False) is True, 
- ((o&(True&F))&F) is False, because ""A & F"" is always False,
- (F&False) is False, because ""A & F"" is always False,  

Resulting in:

Step 3:
- (False&False) is just False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Inside the first paranthesis, ""v | F | F"" simplifies to ""v"", because an OR operation involving a False value and a variable yields the value of that variable. So, the left part of the expression becomes ""v"".

2. Inside the second paranthesis, anything AND-ed with False yields False: ""(T & (F & F)) & T | F "" simplifies to ""F | F"" which further simplifies to F. Similarly, anything AND-ed with not T (which is False) also yields False. So, the second part of the expression within the parantheses can simplify to F, making the whole clause as ""(h & F | !F)"".

3. ""h & F"" gives False, and ""not False"" gives True. Hence this simplifies to ""F|T"" which gives ""T"". 

4. Hence, the entire formula simplifies to ""(v & T) | T"". The first part of this expression simply simplifies to ""v"", because anything AND-ed with True gives the original value. The expression further simplifies to ""v | T"".

(((w|(T&(((q|q)&q)|T)))&F)|(((!(!(((w&F)|((F&T)|(F&T)))&F)))|T)|F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, as per semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, ""T & F"" and ""F & T"" both return F as anything AND False is False. ""q | q"" returns true if q is true and false if q is false, so this can be simplified to ""q"". Hence this simplifies the equation to:
((w|(T&((q&q)|T)))&F)|((!(!(((w&F)|(F|F)))&F))|T)|F)).

2. Now, since anything AND False is False, ""q & q"" simplifies to ""q"" and ""(w & F)"" simplifies to ""F"". So, now the equation looks like this:
((w|(T&(q|T)))&F)|((!(!(F|F))&F)|T)|F)).

3. Next, as anything OR True is True, ""q | T"" and ""F | F"" simplify to T. So, the expression becomes:

4. T & T is T and ""not T"" is F. So, we get:

5. Since anything AND False is False, ""!F & F"" becomes ""F"" and ""w & T"" is simplified to ""w"". The equation simplifies to:
(w&F)|((F|T)|F)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any logic formula AND True is equivalent to the logic formula itself, because everything AND True remains the same. As such, our expression simplifies to:
   (w&w)&(T|((F&(!(F|((j&F)&F))))&(g|(((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T))).

2. Any logic formula AND itself like (w&w) is equivalent to the logic formula (w), because a value AND itself remains the same. 
   Our expression hence simplifies to:
   w&(T|((F&(!(F|((j&F)&F))))&(g|(((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T))).

3. Recognize that for any logic statement, logic formula OR True is always True. Hence, ((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T simplifies to T. 
   Our formula thus simplifies to:
   w&(T|((F&(!(F|((j&F)&F))))&g|T)).

4. Note that a value OR True is always True. So the formula (F|((j&F)&F))) simplifies to T. Our expression hence becomes:
   w&(T|(F&!T)&g|T).

5. For any logic expression, NOT True becomes False. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
   w&(T|(F&F)&g|T).

6. Any value AND False is always False. Therefore, (F&F) simplifies to F. So, our expression simplifies to:
   w&(T|F)&g|T.

7. Any logic expression OR False remains the same. So, our expression simplifies to:

8. Recognizing that any logic formula AND True is simply itself and any logic formula OR True is always True, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the innermost expressions:

T & F [In an 'and' conjunction, if one statement is false the whole conjunction is false]
= F

Now, statements like d & F [Any literal/value 'and' with False is False]
= F

And similarly T & F [In an 'and' conjunction, if one statement is false the whole conjunction is false]
= F

Then, any literal or False & any literal becomes the literal itself:

F | d [In an 'or' disjunction, if one statement is false the other one is kept]
= d

And F | T [In an 'or' disjunction, if one statement is true the whole disjunction is true]
= T

Now, let's look at the whole given formula again.

T & d [In an 'and' conjunction, if one statement is true the other is kept]
= d

Additionally, any literal or True is True:

d | T [In an 'or' disjunction, if one statement is true the whole disjunction is true]
= T

In our expression we have q & T which becomes:

q & T [In an 'and' conjunction, if one statement is true the other is kept]
= q

On further simplification, 

i & q [In an 'and' conjunction, both statements must be true to be true, otherwise, it returns one of them]
= i&q

Again any statement or True is True:

i | T [In an 'or' disjunction, if one statement is true the whole disjunction is true]
= T

And so, the simplified version of this logic formula is:

3. As per boolean logic, ""anything OR False"" is the same thing. So, (T|F) becomes T, (b&b) simplifies to b and (T|b) simplifies to T. This means that our formula simplifies to (((e&(e&(e&T)))|(F|(F&(!T))))|(F&T))&(e&e)).

4. !T is F, so our formula simplifies to (((e&(e&(e&T)))|(F|(F&F)))|(F&T))&(e&e)).

5. (F&F) is F, which simplifies our formula to (((e&(e&(e&T)))|F)|(F&T))&(e&e)).
