A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we need to solve for each SM operator:
SM [2 3] = 5 (because 2 + 3 = 5)
SM [2 5] = 7 (because 2 + 5 = 7)
SM [6 3] = 9 (because 6 + 3 = 9)
SM [9 9] = 8 (because 9 + 9 = 18, but due to the modulo operator, we only get the remainder of the division by 10, which is 8)

Next, we will find the minimum values for each MIN operator:
MIN [5 0] = 0 (since 0 is the minimum value)
MIN [3 1] = 1
MIN [5 4] = 4
MIN [8 8] = 8

In the next bracket, [SM 6 6] equals 12 modulo 10 = 2 and [MAX 9 0] is 9. So the [MAX [SM 6 6] [MAX 9 0]] becomes [MAX 2 9] which equals 9.

[MIN 6 6] = 6
[MIN 0 8] = 0
[MAX 7 6] = 7
[SM 1 1] = 2 (Because sum modulo 10 of 1 and 1 is 2)
[MAX 5 4] = 5
[MIN 1 1] = 1
[SM 1 2] = 3 (Because sum modulo 10 of 1 and 2 is 3)
[MIN 1 1] = 1

Now the expression is:
[MIN [SM [MAX 6 0] [MAX 7 2]] [SM [MIN 5 1] [SM 3 1]]]

Doing the remaining operations:
[MAX 6 0] = 6
[MAX 7 2] = 7
[MIN 5 1] = 1
[SM 3 1] = 4
[SM 6 7] = 3 (Because sum modulo 10 of 6 and 7 is 3)
[SM 1 4] = 5 (Because sum modulo 10 of 1 and 4 is 5)

The expression is now:
[MIN 3 5]

Finally, [MIN 3 5] = 3.
So, the answer is 3.",3,3

Solve the following expression involving these operators:
[MAX [MIN [MIN [MIN 3 0] [SM 1 5]] [MAX [MIN 3 4] [MAX 6 7]]] [MIN [MAX [MAX 1 0] [MIN 4 6]] [MAX [MAX 5 7] [SM 8 3]]]].

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the innermost expressions:
MIN 3 0 = 0
SM 1 5 = (1+5) modulo 10 = 6
MIN 3 4 = 3
MAX 6 7 = 7
MAX 1 0 = 1
MIN 4 6 = 4
MAX 5 7 = 7
SM 8 3 = (8+3) modulo 10 = 1

Substitute these solutions back into the original expression:
[MAX [MIN [MIN 0 6] [MAX 3 7]] [MIN [MAX 1 4] [MAX 7 1]]]

Then, let's solve for the following:
MIN 0 6 = 0
MAX 3 7 = 7
MAX 1 4 = 4
MAX 7 1 = 7

Substitute these solutions back into the expression:
[MAX [MIN 0 7] [MIN 4 7]] = [MAX 0 [MIN 4 7]]

Solving for the last operators:
MIN 4 7 = 4

Substitute back into the expression:
MAX 0 4 = 4

So, the solution is 4.",4,4
