A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any value AND with False (F&T) will yield False. Thus, ""F&T"" simplifies to ""F"".
2. Any value OR with False will yield the original value itself. Therefore, ""i|F"" simplifies to ""i"".
3. The expression ""!(!T)"" will simplify to ""T"" (since !T is False, and !False is True).
4. Any value AND with True will yield the original value itself. So, ""(j|j)&j"" simplifies to ""j"".
5. ""F&F"" simplifies to ""F"", and ""!(F&F)"" simplifies to ""!F"", which is True (T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: Simplify (x&x), (c&c) and (F&T)
Both (x&x) and (c&c) simplify to x and c respectively since a value ANDed with itself will always give the same value. 
(F&T) simplifies to F, since False AND True is always False.

We now have:
(((x&((x|(x&x))|x))&x)|(!(!(F&(!(((((c|c)|c)|c)|((!(F&T))|T)))))).
    = (((x&((x|x)|x))&x)|(!(!(F&(!(((((c|c)|c)|c)|(!(F)|T))))))).

Step 2: Simplify x|x and c|c and F|T
Both (x|x) and (c|c) simplify to x and c respectively, since a value ORed with itself is always that same value. 
F|T simplifies to T, since False OR True is always True.

F&F simplifies to F, since False AND False is False.
!T simplifies to F, since NOT True is False.

Step 5: Evaluate !T
!T simplifies to F, since NOT True is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The portions of the formula that contain `T|T` or `T&T` will simply evaluate to `T` because either True `OR` True and True `AND` True is always `T`.

So, the simplified portion becomes `(T | (T & T)) & (T & (T & !((!(!(!F)) & !(T&!j&F)) | !t|T))))`.

We know that `T&!J&F` can be only two potential cases. Either `J` is `T`, in which case `!J` is `F` so the whole expression equates to `F`. Or `J` is `F`, in which case `!J` is `T`, but we still get `F` because `F` `AND` any other value is `F`. Hence, the `T&!J&F` can be replaced by `F`, and the whole expression simplifies to `(T | T) & (T & (T & !((!(!(!F)) & !F) | !t|T)))`.

Since `F&F` simplifies to `F` and `!F` simplifies to `T`, the expression now becomes `(T | T) & (T & (T & !((!(!T)) & T) | !t|T))`.

If we negate `(!T)` it becomes `F`, hence the expression becomes `(T | T) & (T & (T & !(F&T) | !t|T)`. 

Following this, `F&T` simplifies to `F` and `!(F)&T` simplifies to `T`. Thus, the simplified expression is `(T | T) & (T & T & T | !t | T))`.

Now, T OR anything else is always T. Also, T AND anything else is that anything else. So, the simplest expression is `!t | T` which is always `T`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Since 'F' means False and False OR anything equals to anything itself ((F|any_value) = any_value), we can remove all ""(F|...)"". Also 'T' is for True and True AND anything equals to anything itself ((T&any_value) = any_value). We can remove all ""(T&...)"". So the equation becomes

((z&(((s|s|s)&F)|F))|(T&(!((w|s|T)|u&F)))).

2. (s|s|s) simplifies to s. Also (u&F) equals to F (F&any_value) = F) and anything OR False is anything. So

    (((s|s|s)&F)|F) simplifies to ((s&F)|F) and
    (!((w|s|T)|u&F)) simplifies to (!(w|s|T|F)).

3. However, anything OR True is always True (any_value | T = T), so (!(w|s|T|F)) simply means False (!T). Then, (s&F) also means False (F&any_value = F), so our formula simplifies to

(T&F) is False. ((((T&F)|T)|F)) simplifies to False or T or F, which is T. So h or T simplifies to T, and not T (i.e., !T) is F. (T|F) is T. Therefore, F&T results into F.

- (!(!(!((F|F)|T)))) simplifies as follows: (F|F) is F and (F|T) is T and negation of T is F. Applying double negation law, this part simplifies to T.

- (F&w) is equivalent to F because anything logical AND with False gives False.

- (!F) is T because negation of False returns True.

- Anything AND with False gives False so ((T&F)&T) simplifies to F.

- Since the AND operation is commutative, we can switch (w | T) to (T | w), and anything OR with True gives True, the expression simplifies to True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, consider the formulas involving 'F' and 'T'. We have several logical operations to perform. Here's what we know:
   
   - 'F | x' is equivalent to 'x': if at least one of 'F' (False) or 'x' is True, the result is True, and since 'F' is False, the result identical to the value of 'x'.
   - 'T & x' is equivalent to 'x': if both 'T' (True) and 'x' are True, the result is True, and since 'T' is always True, the result is simply the value of 'x'.
   - '!F' is equivalent to 'T': negation flips the truth value, so not False is True.
   - 'T | T' or any number of 'T' with OR operation is equivalent to 'T': if at least one is True the result is True, and since 'T' is always True, the result is True no matter how many times it is repeated.
   - 'F & x' is equivalent to 'F': if both 'F' (False) and 'x' are True, the result is True, and since 'F' is always False, the result is False no matter the value of 'x'.

2. Using those equivalences, we can simplify the given formula to:

   '(T & (o | (T & (u | T)))) | T', which simplifies to,

   '(o | (u | T)) | T'.

3. The expressions '(u | T)' and '(o | T)' are True because they involve an OR operation with 'T'. The whole expression thus simplifies to 'T | T', which is just 'T'.

Again simplifying (z&z) to z gives:
(T&(x&(((z&T)&T)|F)|z)&T)&F).

5. T & False, regardless of the value of T, will always result in False. So, the expression becomes:
(T&((e&False)&(F&T)).

6. (e&False) simplifies to False, so now we have:
(T&(False&(F&T)).

7. Finally, we consider the (F&T) expression. It doesn't matter the value of T, False and T is always False. So, the expression becomes (T&(False&False)), which resolves to (T&False).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we need to know the logic values of T and F. T is True and F is False. Thus:

(!F) = not False = True.
(!T) = not True = False. 

Also, we know that anything OR False is itself, and anything AND False is False, anything AND True is itself. Hence,

(F|F) = False or False = False.
(F&F) = False and False = False.
(T&T) = True and True = True.

Replace these values in our formula:

(((!F)&((!F)|((z&(((T&((F)|(F)))|(!(F)))))|(T&(F)))))|(!T))

4. F|F simplifies to F (false or false is always false)
5. T&T simplifies to T (true and true is true)
6. T|(!F) simplifies to T (true or anything is always true)

Inserting these simplifications back into the original formula, we get:
((((b&((r&(T))|F))|(T&T))&T)|b)|b

This can be further simplified:

1. r&T simplifies to r (anything and true is itself)
2. T|F simplifies to T (true or anything is always true)
3. b&((r|F)) simplifies to b&r
4. (T&T) simplifies to T
5. (T&b) simplifies to b
6. (b|b) simplifies to b (anything or itself is always itself)

(T&(T&T)) equals to T, because True AND True AND True always equals True.

Now, (T&F) equals to F, because True AND False always equals False.

Let's also simplify (F&(F|T)). (F|T) equals to T because False OR True equals True. So (F&T) is just False because False AND True equals False.

Let's change the given formula with these facts.

(((q&q)|q) & ((x&((x|F)|F)) | (x&(x|((F&T)&T)))) & F).

This can be further simplified.

Repeat the same simplification steps:

(F&T) equals False, because False AND True equals False.

x|F equals x, because any literal OR False keeps the value of the original literal

Then the formula changes to 

(((q&q)|q) & ((x&x) | (x&x)) & F)

3. So, given F&((T|F)|T) becomes F&T which is F.

4. !F is T.

5. Therefore, the formula is simplified to (((l&(w&T)&w)&l)&T)&(l|(j&(v&F))).

6. w&T which is equivalent to w, because any literal AND True is the literal itself.

7. Therefore, the formula simplifies further to (((l&w)&l)&T)&(l|(j&(v&F))).

8. v&F which is equivalent to F, because any literal AND False is False.

9. Therefore, the formula simplifies further to (((l&w)&l)&T)&(l|(j&F)).

- (!(T | (!(F|T)))) simplifies to F (because (!T) is F and F | T gives us T, so NOT of T is False)
- ((!T) & T) simplifies to F (since NOT T is F and F AND T is F)

Step 2: plug those simplified expressions back in the formula:
The formula then becomes:

Step 3: further simplify:

2. Similarly, (X | F) is always X, because or-ing with False doesn't change anything. So (a|F) can be simplified to a and (j|F) can be simplified to j. Now the formula simplifies to (!(F | (w|((!F)|(j|F)|!(v&l&a))))).

3. Now we simplify (j&j) as j because and-ing something with itself doesn't change its value. We now simplify (w | (!F)) to (w | T), given that  (!F) equals T.

4. Now, since (X | T) is always True, regardless of the value X, we thus simplify (w | T) to T. We are left with: !(F | T | j | (!u & l& a)).

5. The logical OR operator with F and other elements can be eliminated because F or anything is just equal to that anything, which leads to: !(T | j | (!v & l & a)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we will simplify each operation one by one.

1. (F | !(F | F)):
The operation inside the bracket (F | F) will be False, because False OR False is False. Then the NOT operation will occur, NOT False is True. So, (F | !(F | F)) is True.

2. (T | (T & ((z & F) | (b & F) | (b & F)) & T)):

((l & l) | l) & (l | T)

Since, l AND l = l, we have,

(l | l) & (l | T)

It simplifies to l & (l  | T).

Since, anything OR True is True, we have,

(c|(c|c)) can be simplified to c, i.e., c or c is still c.

(F&(j|T)) is F, because False and any value is always False, which yields:
((c)&T)&((c|F)|c).
Simplifying gives us:
((c)&T)&(c|c).

One last simplification:
(c|c) simplifies to c. Our expression is now

For AND: 
    (h & h) = h
    Anything AND False will be False, so F & h = F.
    Anything AND True will remain itself, so T & F = F.

For OR:

The simplified expression now looks like this: ((!((!T)&((!(m&F))|(T))))|(F|(y&F)))

2. The NOT operator changes True to False and vice versa. So, applying the NOT operator to T will result in F.

The simplified expression now looks like this: (!((F)&((!(m&F))|(T)))|(F|(y&F)))

3. In the left part of the formula, a couple more simplifications can be done.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. T | F = T because an OR operation with at least one True value is always True.
2. T & T = T because an AND operation with all True values is True.
3. !F = T because NOT operation negates the initial value, so NOT False results in True.
4. T | F = T, as discussed previously, OR operation with at least one True is always True.
5. Any operations with False using AND operator gives False. Therefore, (v & (T | F)) & F = F.
6. F | T = T, because anything OR True is always True.
7. n | T = T, since ANYTHING OR True is always True.
8. (T & T) & F = F, as the result with False using AND operator always gives False.
9. ((T & T) & F) | F = F, because all elements were False.
10. Anything AND True still remains the same. Therefore, whole expression becomes T | T = T.

3. (T|(F)): This will be True (T), as 'or' operation will be True if any one of the operands is True.
4. (((v&T)|T): This will be True (T), because v&T could be either True or False, but 'or' operation with True gives True.
5. (!(T|F)): This will be False (F), as not operation on True gives False.
6. (F&F): This will be False (F), as 'and' operation will be False if any one of the operands is False.

Now insert these results back into the expression:

(T|(((x&((T|F)|T))|(((x&(((T)|T)|F)|T))&T)&x))&(F))

This simplifies to:

(T|(((x&(T|T))|((x&(T|F)&T)&x))&F))

Which becomes:

(T|(((x&T)|((x&T)&x)&F))

Which simplifies even further to:

(T|((x|((x&x)&F))

Now, (x&x) will always be x, and any value x AND False is always False, so the above expression simplifies to:

2. Any value 'OR' with itself remains the same value. Therefore, (p|p) simplifies to p.
3. 'True OR True' is always True, so (T|T) simplifies to T.
4. Any value 'AND' with 'True' remains the same value. Therefore, (p&T) simplifies to p
5. The expression inside the parenthesis, (! f | (m | T)) can be simplified. Any value 'OR' with 'True' is always True. Therefore, (m | T) simplifies to T and (! f | T) simplifies to T.
6. Once again, any value 'AND' with 'True', remains the same value. Therefore, the expression (! f | (m | T)) & T simplifies further to T.

2. AND operation on two identical terms, i.e., (y&y), is equivalent to the term itself, i.e., y.

3. Logical OR with false (l|F) is equivalent to the term l. So, (l|F) simplifies to l.

4. Logical OR with true (T|F), is always true (T). Applying AND operation with T ((T|F)&T) keeps the T.

5. However, this result is then logically OR'd with h ((h|((T|F)&T))), which simplifies to h.

6. Logical AND with false (F&(t&F)) is always false (F).

8. Logical OR with false (((b&b)|((h|T)|F))|F)&F is equivalent to the complex expression itself, so it simplifies to (b&(((b|b)|F)&b))|h|F.

9. Because AND operation is distributive over OR operation, this simplifies to b&b or b&h |F|F|F, because F | F simplifies to F.

10. OR operation on a term with itself, is equivalent to the term itself, so (b&b) or b&h simplifies to b or h.

    (((((((j|(j&T))|j)&j)&T)&!F)&j)&F)&F

3. We continue by applying the Identity Law (p&p = p), Domination Law (p&F = F) and Law of Negation (!F = T):

    (((((j|j)&j)&T)&T)&j)&F

4. Continue simplification:

    ((j&T)&j)&F

5. By Domination Law (p&F = F):

    F

So, the simplified logic formula is F.",F,F
