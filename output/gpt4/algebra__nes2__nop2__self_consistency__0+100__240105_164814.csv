A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's combine like terms:

(-7*a*b*x*y - 60*a*b*x*y) + (-46*a*b*x*y - 30*a*b*x*y)

= -67*a*b*x*y - 76*a*b*x*y

Now, combine those terms:

= -143*a*b*x*y

Let's compute the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient -143. Remember, if the numerator is negative, we compute modulo -100:

-143 mod -100 = -43

So, the simplified algebraic expression is:

-43*a*b*x*y",-43*a*b*x*y,-43*a*b*x*y

Subtracting modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient of each intermediate value if it's positive, and adding modulo 100 if it's negative, we get:
