A: Let's think step-by-step.","We will be using four properties of logical operations:

4. Negation law: !T = F and !F = T 

Our given expression is 
((T&((t&(T|F))&F))&((!((T|T)|F))&T))

Let's begin. 

First, in all the '|'(or) operations, if you have a T(True), the result is True. If you get a '&' (and) with a F (False), the result is False. Accordingly, our expression simplifies to:

((T&((t&1)&F))&((!(1|F))&T)) -> ((T&((t&True)&False))&((!(True))&T)) -> ((T&False)&False&T) -> (False&False&T)

Next, consider '&&(and)' operation. The result is true if and only if both the operands are true. Thus the above expression simplifies to:

• F | !T can be simplified into F | F, which yields False (F).

Hence, !(T & (F | !T)) equals !F, which is True (T).

Secondly, simplify the other part of the given logic formula:

b) T & T = T. 

c) g | T = T.

d) T | F = T.

Using these elementary logic rules, we simplify the input equation to:

2. ""F|F"" - This is again a logical disjunction but this time both operands are 'F'. With this operation, if both the operands are 'F', the result is also 'F'.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify the nested expressions. 

From the expression (F&F), there are two Falses being connected via AndAlso. Therefore, this simplifies to False.

Then for (T&(F|T)), because we are using Or, as long as one of the pairs is true, the value is true. Therefore, (F or T) is True. Then (T & True) also equals to True. 

So far, our formula simplifies to (False|((((w|w)&w)&w)|(z|True))). 

But remember, if any value is Or-ed with True, the result is always True. Therefore, (z|True) equals to True.

Our formula now becomes (False|((((w|w)&w)&w)|True)). 

But again, if any value is Or-ed with True, the result is always True. Therefore, (((w|w)&w)&w)|True is also True.

So, the whole expression now simplies to (False | True), and because False OR True result to True, the simplified formula is T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider the Boolean constants: T (True) and F (False). 

Then, simplify the expressions involving these constants:

F & F = F  (False and False equals False)
T | F = T  (True or False equals True)
T | !F = T (True or not False equals True, as not False is True)

Replace the above in the original formula to get: (!((T|(F))|((b|F)&F)))|(T).

Next, further simplify:

T | F = T (True or False equals True)
b | F = b (Any Boolean or False equals original Boolean value)
T & F = F (True and False equals False)

The formula becomes:  !((T|F))|T, which is equivalent to !(T)|T.

Again, simplify:

!T = F (Not True equals False)

So the formula becomes: F|T which means False or True. 

Finally, simplify this to get T, because when ""or"" operator is used and one of them is True, the result is always True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","We should utilize the following fundamental laws of logic:

1) T and X = X (True and any value equal this value)
2) T or X = T (True or any value equals True)
3) F or X = X (False or any value equals this value)
4) F and X = F (False and any value equals False)

Let's start with:
1) Simplify from the inner parentheses: (F|T) is equal to T because True or any value equals True. So we now have:
((g&(t|T))&(g&(g|F)))

2) Replace (t | T) and (g | F). Because both expressions have an or operation with T and F, they equal T and g, respectively. So, now the equation becomes:
(g & T) & (g & g)

3) Replace (g & T) and (g & g). Both equal g because of and logic rule specified above. So we end up with:
g & g

4) This expression simply means g, because any value and-ed with itself equals itself. Therefore, for the entire expression we have:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (T&(F&(F|(F|F))) - F&X = F, so this part simplifies to F. This is because the logical AND operator (&) produces True only if both operands are True. Here, we can see that we have F &, which yields False regardless of the other operand.

2. (!(T|F)) - T|F = T, so this part simplifies to !T or F. This is because the logical OR operator (|) yields True if at least one operand is True. Here, we can see that we have T |, which yields True. The logical NOT operator (!) changes True to False.

3. (T|F) - T|F = T, so this part simplifies to T. This is because the logical OR operator (|) produces True if at least one operand is True. Here, we have T |, which is True.

2. So the term ((!((h|h)&F))|T)) will be (T|T) which is also T (since T OR T is always True).

3. The similar logic applies to ((((z&z)&F)|T)|T). This also simplifies to T.

Next, logical or is associative, which means the operation produces the same result regardless of the grouping of operands. Therefore, o | o = o (rule 1).

So, we get: o | (!((!F) | (F & T))). 

Going further, we can simplifies !F to True (rule 3). Also, (F& T) simplifies to F (rule 2) .

Now the expression is: o | (!(T | F)).

And T | F simplifies to T (rule 4).

Then, the expression becomes: o | !T.

!T simplifies to False (rule 3), making the expression o | F.

4. (q & T) = q, because anything 'and' true is itself.
5. (T & F) = F, because true 'and' false is always false.

Replacing these in the formula we get:
The formula simplifies to ((q&T)&F), which again upon simplifying (as per step 4 and 5 above), we get q & F.

The operation !(!F) simplifies to !T, since !F is equivalent to T. The final simplification here is F as the negation of T is F.

Hence, we reach the following formula: ((x&T)|x)|F. 

Since anything AND'd with T is itself, (x&T) is simply x. Therefore the expression can be simplified to (x|x)|F.

((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula can be simplified as follows:

Firstly, simplify inner brackets using the rule that anything AND False is False, and True AND anything is the thing itself:

- (T&(T&(o&(T&F)))) simplifies to (T&(T&(o&F))) which simplifies to (T&(T&F)) which simplifies to (T&F) which is F
- (k&((T&(F&F))|F)) simplifies to (k&((T&F)|F)) which simplifies to (k&(F|F)) which simplifies to (k&F) which is F

Then, the whole formula simplifies to (F|F) which is F. So, the whole logic formula is equivalent to F.",F,F

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","We use the known fact that any literal value (in this case, 'a' and 'h') AND with False would result in False. So, 

1. (a&F) simplifies to F, and (h&F) simplifies to F. It gives us:
f|F&F|f|(F|F)&T

2. F&F simplifies to F, and F|F simplifies to F. So, we get:
f|F|f|F&T 

3. f or F simplifies to f, and F&T simplifies to F. So it becomes: f|f|F.

4. Again, f or f or F simplifies to f. So the final simplification of the logic formula is 'f'.",f,f

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b)&(!(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, the truth value in all the logical operations where there's T is given by the other operand. So, the expression (((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b)&(!(!T))) simplifies as b&(!(!T)).

2. Similarly, the truth value in all the logical operations where there's F or !F is given by the other operand. So, the expression b&(!(!T)) simplifies as b&T.

3. Negation of a truth value flips the value. Since T is true, negation of T twice (!(!T)) results in T itself.

4. Hence, the expression simplifies to b&T. But, again T in logical and operation is identity element. So, The expression is further simplified as b. 

Therefore, the simplified form of the logic expression is b.",b,b

((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, negate T: 
!T = F  because the value of T (True) is flipped to F (False)

Next, realize that when OR'd with F, the other value will always prevail. 

Hence,
F | F = F  
F | T = T 

Similarly, realize that when AND'd with F, the final value will always be F.

Therefore,
(F|T) & F = F & F = F 

Now, you are left with: 
((F|F)|(((( !T )& (F|F)) | T) | F))

Substitute all the calculated values:

= (F | ((F & F) | T | F)) = (F | (F | T | F))

As before, calculate the OR operations with F and T to get:

= (F | (T))

Again, as before, when OR'd with F, the other value will always prevail. 

So the simplified logic formula is simply:

T",T,T
