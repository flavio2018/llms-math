= 93 * y - 145 * y 
= -52*y (Since 93 - 145 = -52)

Finally, simplify the expression:
-52*y mod -100 = -52

So the simplified form of the given expression is -52*y.",-52*y,+48*y

((+3*x*y-61*x*y)+(+49*x*y+66*x*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can combine the like terms within each set of parentheses:

3*x*y - 61*x*y is -58*x*y.
49*x*y + 66*x*y is 115*x*y.

Now, we can add these together:

-58*x*y + 115*x*y is 57*x*y.

Looking at the modulo 100, the numerical coefficient 57 is positive, so we compute its modulo 100.

Since 57 < 100, 57 modulo 100 is just 57.

So, the simplified form of the provided algebraic expression, with the modulo 100 of its numerical coefficient calculated, is 57*x*y.",57*x*y,-43*x*y

((+37*y+74*y)+(+94*y+64*y)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, combine the terms that have similar variables. 

For the first part of the expression:

37*y + 74*y = 111*y

Then for the second part of the expression:

94*y + 64*y = 158*y

Now, you add the two parts together:

111*y + 158*y = 269*y

This is your simplified algebraic expression.

Now you need to calculate the modulo 100 of the numerical coefficient of each intermediate value if it was positive, and the modulo -100 if it was negative.

For 111*y, the coefficient is 111. The modulo 100 would be 11. 

For 158*y, the coefficient is 158. The modulo 100 would be 58.

For 269*y, the coefficient is 269. The modulo 100 would be 69.

So, we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the values in the two parenthesis. 

The first parenthesis (+5*a*b*x*y-95*a*b*x*y) becomes -90*a*b*x*y. Its numerical coefficient is -90, which simplifies to -90 modulo -100 (remains -90, because -90 is more than -100).

The second parenthesis (+78*a*b*x*y-48*a*b*x*y) becomes +30*a*b*x*y. Its numerical coefficient is +30, which simplifies to +30 modulo 100 (remains 30, because 30 is less than 100).

Next, add the simplified expressions from the two parenthesis. 
So, you get -90*a*b*x*y+30*a*b*x*y which becomes -60*a*b*x*y. 

So, the numerical coefficient is -60, which simplifies to -60 modulo -100 (remains -60, because -60 is more than -100).
