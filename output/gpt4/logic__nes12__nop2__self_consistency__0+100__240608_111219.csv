A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, eliminate parts that consist of constants only. 

    - (!T) is F
    - (F|T) is T

Then we get: 

    ((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|F))|(w&F))))&T)|w))&((w&((F|(T&T))|T))|w))&T)).

2. Eliminate unused expressions:

    (w | F) is always equivalent to T. It means that any literal w always has an output as T. 

    Following the rule, (w & F) is always equivalent to F.

Then we get:

    (T&(((w|(((w|w)&T)|w))&((w&((F|T))|w))&T)).

3. Further simplification:

    - (((w|w)&T)|w)), simplifying (w | w) gives w,  hence (((w|w)&T)|w)) will simplify to (w & T) | w, which is equivalent to T as long as w is defined, gives us ((T&((w&((F|T))|w))&T)).

    - ((F|T)|w) is the same as (T|w), which is always equivalent to T.

Finally, by applying ""and"" table rules (T&T = T), we get:

4. Any statement AND F is always False. Therefore, ((F&F)&(!F)) is F.
5. Any statement OR F is the same as the original statement. Therefore, (T|(T|F)) is T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, simplify the redundant expressions within the formula. Any value ""v&F"" or ""F&v"" is False, so ""(v|v)&F"" is False.

Also, ""F&F"" is False and any value ""v|v"" is equal to ""v"". So ""(F&F)"" will be F also ""l|(l|(l|l))"" will be equal to ""l"".

Next, any value ""v|F"" or ""F|v"" is equal to ""v"". So the formula simplifies to: 
(!(T&((!T)&((l&((l|F)|(l&T))|l))|(T|F))))|(!(o&(b&F))).

Since ""T|F"" or ""F|T"" is True: 
(!(T&((!T)&((l&l)|l))|T))|(!(o&F)).

""v&v"" is ""v"":
(!(T&(!T&l)|T))|(!o).

4. NOT FALSE is TRUE, and NOT TRUE is FALSE.

- !F (Not False) simplifies to T (True)
- T&(!F) (True and Not False) simplifies to T (True), because both elements are true.
- F|(T&(!F)) simplifies to F|T (False or True), which simplifies to T (True), because at least one condition is true.

Let's simplify (((x|x)|x)&T) next.

- (((x|x)|x)&T) simplifies to (x&T), because x OR x OR x is equal to x, and x AND T is logically equivalent.

Following this, we simplify T|F (True or False) and T&(!F) (True and Not False)

- T|F simplifies to T (True), as at least one condition is true.
- !(True & Not False) simplifies to F (False), as we are negating a true condition.

Let's simplify (x|(x&(T|F))) next.

- This simplifies to x|x (x OR x), since x AND T is equivalent to x. This further simplifies to x.

So far, we have ((T)|((c&((x&x)|F))&F)|(!T))|(F|T)|T) from the given expression.

Let's simplify further.

- (x&x) simplifies to x (same conditions AND'ed)
- ((x&x)|F)&F simplifies to F (x OR False specified as False).

When any value is and-ed with True, it doesn't affect the result. It remains the value that is and-ed with True. 

So, your expression simplifies to:

Firstly, (((T&F)&F)&(!((((F|(T|((F|T)|((T&F)&T))))|(!((v|T)&T))))&(T&(F&F)))))&(w&F)))

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formulas follows these laws:

1. The law of duality: In a dual form, each ∨ is replaced by ∧ and each ∧ is replaced by ∨. Also, the true condition (T) is replaced by the false condition (F) and likewise.

2. De Morgan's laws: ¬ (p ∧ q) = ¬ p ∨ ¬ q and ¬ (p ∨ q) = ¬ p ∧ ¬ q

3. Law of absorption: p ∨ (p ∧ q) = p , and p ∧ (p ∨ q) = p

4. Law of idempotency: p ∨ p = p, and p ∧ p = p

5. Law of nullity: p ∨ F = p and p ∧ F = F

6. Law of domination: p ∨ T = T, and p ∧ T = p

7. Law of complements: p ∨ ¬p = T and p ∧ ¬p = F

8. Law of conditional statements: p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q

Also, whenever you have a formula F&X or T|X, you can simplify this to F and T respectively because anything ANDed with False is False, and anything ORed with True is True.

Looking at the formula, 
we see that there's a portion that reads (m&F)&F. According to the law of nullity, any variable ANDed with False is False. So m&F simplifies to F. As such, the portion can be simplified to F&F which still equals to F.

So now, the formula simplifies to:
(e & ((((F|((F& T)| F))&T)|T)&T) | ((h&(c&F))&T))) | ((e&T)|e)

But it doesn't end here. Any variable ORed with False is always equal to the value of the variable itself. In this case that leads to the further simplification of the formula:

(e & ( (T&T)&T)) | (F&T)) | e 

But any variable ANDed with True is also equal to the value of the variable itself. This simplifies the formula further:

(e & T) | e 

Now if we use the law of domination (p ∧ T = p), the formula sbriefla into:

e | e 

Lastly, using the law of idempotency (p ∨ p = p), the formula simplifies to:

2) (F|T), (T|T) and (F|(p|T)) will be T, because it's logical OR and at least one of the values is T.
3) (T&T), (!(!T)) and ((F&F)&T) will result in T, because it's logical AND and all the values are T.
4) (F&((F|(p|T))&(d&((T&(!(!T)))&(T&((F&F)&T)))) will result in F, because it's logical AND and one of the values is F. Thus, the whole expression results in F.

     a. (F|T) simplifies to T (since anything OR-ed with True is True)
     b. (T|F) simplifies to T (since anything OR-ed with True is True)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, simplify the components involving logical ""or"" with T or F. Since anything ""or"" with T is T, and anything ""or"" with F is the same thing, we can simplify as follows:
(((t|((i&T)&((!(T&F))|(F|T)))|T)|T))|T)&((T&((T&T)&T))&T)) =>
((t|(i&T)|T)&T).

2. Secondly, as per logic syntax, anything logical ""And"" with T remains the same. Therefore:
((t|(i&T)|T)&T) => (t|(i&T)|T).

3. Thirdly, again apply the logic where that anything ""Or"" with T is always T:
(t|(i&T)|T) => T. 

Therefore, the final simplified formula is T. So, regardless of the value of t and i, the entire logic formula always results in True (T).",T,T

2. `T` | anything = `T`
3. Anything | `F`=  anything
4. `F` & `T` = `F`
5. `!F` = `T`

Given these rules, let's simplify:

((F&((F&(p&F))&T))&(T|(F|(((n|F)|((((n|(((F&T)|F)|(!(F|T))))|(n|(F|F)))&(b|T))&(!F)))&F)))

First simplify innermost parentheses :
=p&F , which further simplifies to F (Applying rule 1)

= n|F, which further simplifies to n (Applying rule 3)

= F & T, which simpifies to F (Applying rule 4)

Then the expression becomes: ((F&F&T)&(T|F|((n|((n|(F&T|F|T))&(n|(F|F))&(b|T))&T)&F)))

which simplifies to : ((F&T)&(T|((n|((n|(F))&(n|(F|F))&(b|T))&T)&F))

which further simplifies to : ((F)&(T|((n|(n&(n)&(b|T))&T)&F))

which simplifies to : ((F)&(T|(n&b)&T&F))

- if A is any proposition, A or False = A,
- A or True = True,
- A and False = False,
- A and True = A,
- Not False = True, Not True = False.

We can use these rules to simplify the formula. 

Starting from the innermost parentheses:

((((F&T)|F)|T)&(((((F&(T|(F|T)))&F)&((g|((c|T)|T))&T))&F)|F)) 

can be simplified:
- (F&T) equates to False, It becomes (((False|F)|T)&....)
- False OR F equates to F, It becomes ((F|T)&....)
- F OR T equates to True, It becomes (True&....)
- On the other side, F&(T|(F|T)) folds to False, because F AND something equates to F, It becomes ((((((False)&F)&...)&F)|F))
- Then, False AND F equates again to False, It becomes (((((False)&...))&F)|F)
- Evaluated all the way down, the whole thing equates to False.

So, we are left with (T&(!(False)&(!T))), which equates to True!

The second part is ((n|(T|F))|T), 
- (T|F) equates to True, it becomes (n|True)|T
- n OR True equates to True, it becomes True|T

2. T|any = T, T&any = any and F&any = F, F|any = any

Applying these, we get:

4. !False = True and !True = False

So:

(((((c&(T&True))&c)|F)|(c|c&c))|T)

since z|F equals z and z|z equals z, and z & z also equals z.

Thirdly, !(F|(T|((T|((o|(!F))|((q&q)|T)))&F))) simplifies to !(F|T) = !T = F, because T|(o|T) is T, and T&F is F, which gives us F|T. And negation of True gives False.

2. T & any other formula = formula and !F = T. So (!(((F&T)&T)&T)) can be simplified as T. That means, (F|(T|(!(((F&T)&T)&T)))) can be simplified as T.

3. Any value OR True is equivalent to True. For example: A|T = T, so we have (((...)&T)|F) = T or (...)|T = T, etc.

F | T => T    # False or True is True

3. Any expression when ""or""( | ) with False (F), returns the original expression.

B. ((F | ((o & o) & T)) & F) simplifies to F & F which is F (since ""F and"" anything is F).
C. ((F | F) | ((F | F) & T)) simplifies to F | F which is F (since ""F or"" anything is F).
D. (!((F | (F & F)) | F)) simplifies to !(F | F) which is !F, which is T (since not F is True).
E. So, our expression now looks like:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The main logic gates used here are AND, OR, and NOT. We know the following laws of Boolean algebra:
- NOT(FALSE) equals TRUE, NOT(TRUE) equals FALSE
- FALSE AND something equals FALSE
- TRUE OR something equals TRUE
- FALSE OR something equals something.
Therefore, let's simplify:

1. First, simplify (F&T) and (T&F). Because ""False AND something"" equals False, both (F&T) and (T&F) equal F.
2. Thus, (T&((F&T)|(T&F))) simplifies to (T&F) which equals F. So, (t|(T&((F&T)|(T&F)))) simplifies to (t|F) which simplifies to t.
3. Simplify (T&(!T)). Because ""NOT(True)"" equals False, (!T) equals F. So, (T&(!T)) equals F. Thus, (F|(T&(!T))) simplifies to (F|F) which simplifies to F. So, the expression ((t|(T&((F&T)|(T&F))))|(F|(T&(!T)))) simplifies to (t|F) which simplifies to t.
4. (t&T) equals t, since ""True AND something"" leaves that something unchanged.
5. So, ((((((((((t|(T&((F&T)|(T&F))))|(F|(T&(!T))))&T)&t)&F)&T)&F)) simplifies to F, because ""False AND something"" equals False.
6. Simplify (!(F|((a|T)|F))). Because ""False OR something"" equals that something, ((a|T)|F) simplifies to (a|T) which simplifies to T since ""True OR something"" equals True.

5. h&F immediately evaluates to F, because anything logically 'anded' with F will be F.
6. Thus, !(!(h&h&h)&F) reduces to !(!h&F), and then further down to !F which is T.
7. Consequently, the piece (p|((!((!(!(((h&h)&h)&F)))&T))&T) will simplify to (p|(T&T)), which is just (p|T). Since anything logically 'ored' with T will always be T, the whole expression simplifies to T.

4. At this instance `(a|F)` simplifies to `a`, given if a is True, then the result will be True, else if a is False then the result is False. 
So the expression becomes: `((F|(((a&T)&(n&F))&(k&F)))&(F|(T|T)))&T)|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F))`.

5. Furthermore, `(a&T)` becomes `a` and `(n&F)`, `(k&F)` becomes `F`. This simplification gives: `((F|((a&F)&F))&(F|(T|T)))&T)|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F))`.

6. So, `((a&F)&F)` equals `F`, as False and anything gives always False and `(F|(T|T))` equals `T`, as if any component is True in 'Or', then it gives True. So we get: `((F|F)&T)|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F))`.

7. Thus, `(F|F)&T` reduces to `F&T` which is `F`. Therefore, expression becomes: `F|T))|(T&(((!T)|F)|F))`. 

8. `((!T)|F)` simplifies to `F`. So, the expression becomes: `F|T)|(T&F)`.

9. Then, `T&F` simplifies to `F`, leading to `F|T|F`.

10. And finally `F|T|F` reduces to `T`.

Therefore, error checking and logical simplification leads to the result that the entire logical formula simplifies to `T` or True.",T,T

5. (!T & X) = F & X = F (whatever value X has), so ((!T)&((!(F&(F&F)))|(!(e&(o&F)))))) simplifies to F.
6. Since F & something = F, F & (F & ((!T)|F)) simplifies to F.
7. T & T = T, so (T & T | F) equals to T.
8. F & T equals to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. !(h|T) = F, because anything OR T will always be equivalent to true, therefore !(anything OR T) will be equivalent to false

3. F|F = F, This is the rule of logical OR, requires only one of the inputs to be true for the output to be true
4. T&(F|F) = F, Let's replace (F|F) with F. So, we have T&F = F

First, simplifying inside brackets utilizing that T | X is always T and that T & X is always X (where X can be any logical value), then also that F & X is always F and F | X is always X:

1. (T & (T | ((g & F) | F)))
This simplifies to (T & T) or simply T, because (g & F) | F simplifies to F | F which is F and then T | F is T and T & T is T.

2. (l | (!(T | F)))
This simplifies to l | F, because (T | F) simplifies to T, so !(T) is F. And | F is irrelevant, so we are left with l.

3. (F | (T & (F | ((T & T) & T))))
This simplifies to F | T because F | T is T and T & T is T. So, the whole expression results in T.

Next, rightmost set of outer brackets, (((e | l) & T) | (F | T)) & (!(T) & F), now we know that e | l simplifies to e | l (Because we can't simplify it further without knowing the values of e and l), also T | F simplifies to T.

So, T & (!(T) & F), this simplifies to T & (F & F), because !(T) is F and which further simplifies to T & F, which is simply F.

So, we're left with the following first level of brackets:

Similarly, (x|T) simpifies to T. 

Step 2: Anything AND F equals F (this is because F acts like zero in multiplication). Hence,
(F&(d|T)) simplifies to F,
(T&F) simplifies to F,
(F&F) simplifies to F, 
((T&T)&F) simplifies to F and 
(u&F) simplifies to F. 

Step 3: Anything OR F equals itself (F acts like zero in addition). Hence,
(F|((F&(F&F))|F)) simplifies to F,
(F|F) simplifies to F, and  
(F|F) in the second expression simplifies to F as well. 

Step 4: Not T is equal to F. So !T simplifies to F.

Now, the entire formula simplifies to (T&(F|(T&F))).

Now, the expression (((F&!F)|T)) simplifies to T (since the value of F&!F becomes False and F|T becomes True) and similarly (v&T) simplifies to v (since True & v == v). 

So, the expression becomes:

(F|(l|(T|(T&v)|T))&T)&(b&F).

Then, the expression ((F|(l|(T|(T&v)|T))&T)) simplifies to T (since the logical or with True: T|v is True for any v) and b&F simplifies to F (since the logical and with False: b&F is False for any b).

2. The statement F & something is always F, and something | F is always something, so F & (x & (m & (!T & F))) simplifies to F, y | (T | (!T & (F | F))) simplifies to y | T = T.

2. (F&((j&((!(!T))&T))|(T&(T&(!((F&T)&(!T))))))) simplifies to (F&((j&(T&T))|(T&(T&(!F))))) since '!(!T)' is 'T' and '!((F&T)&(!T))' is '!F'.

On the other hand, T & X (where X is any formula), can be simplified to X because T is the identity for logical and (&).
2. F (False) is the identity for the logical and operator (&), so ""X & F"" (where X is any formula), can be simplified to F. Conversely, F | X (where X is any formula), can be simplified to X because F is the identity for logical or (|).
3. The negation operator (!) in front of a true or false value will flip it. So, !(T) becomes F and !(F) becomes T.

We can start the simplification by using these rules:

- F | T = T.
- F | T | !(F | T) = T because F | T simplifies to T and thus we get T | !(T) which is T.
- p | T = T because anything OR True is always True.
- T & T = T because T & X simplifies as X.
- T &(F | T) = T because anything OR True is always True. Also, T & X = X.
- n & T = n because T & X simplifies as X.
- n | n = n because anything OR the same thing is that thing.
- n & n = n because anything AND the same thing is that thing.
- (n & n) & n = n.
- l | F = l because F | X simplifies as X.
- l & F = F because X & F simplifies as F.
- n & F = F because X & F simplifies as F.
- t | T = T because anything OR True is always True.
- F | F = F because anything OR False simplifies as that thing.
- T & (F | F) = T & F = F.

9. True|T will always be True, because 'or' with True is always True.
10. Now we have: True & (True & True) | (False & False) & ((e | !T) & F)
11. True & True & True simplifies to True, because 'and' with True is always the value of the other operand.
12. (False & False) & Anything simplifies to False because 'and' with False is always False.
13. Now we have: True | False

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we negate values wherever possible. Note that not – T is F, and not – F is T.

Also, notice that any condition OR T is always T, and any condition AND F is always F. 

Adding these points to our formula significantly simplifies:

1. (((T&(F&((!(!(F&(F|T))))&(!(!(s|(((F|T)|(F|F))|(T&T))))))))&F)|T)|((!(F|((t&t)&F)))|F)) becomes:

2. (((T&(F&((!(!F))&(!(!s))))&F)|T)|((!F)|F)) becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, let's simplify the parts that involve T (True) and F (False):

    - F|T equals T, because ""or"" with False does not change the other value, and ""or"" with True always results in True
    - T&F equals F, because ""and"" with True does not change the other value, but ""and"" with False always results in False
    - F|x equals x, because ""or"" with False does not change the other value, where x is any literal
    - x|T equals T, because ""or"" with True always results in True, where x is any literal
    - x&F equals F, because ""and"" with False always results in False, where x is any literal
    - x&T equals x, because ""and"" with True does not change the other value, where x is any literal
  
2. Now, let's insert these conclusions back in:

    - ((s|F)|((F|(!(T|(!(((F|(l|F)&F)&(z&z&z&T|T)))&F)))))&((p&((j&(j|j|F))|T))|T))
    - ((s)|((F|(!(T|(!(((F|l&F)&(z&z&z&T|T)))&F)))))&((p&((j&j|F))|T))
    - ((s)|!(T|(!((F&z)&T|T)))&((p&j|T))
    - (s)&(p|T)

3. Now, let's simplify this:

    - x&T equals x
    - x|T equals T

4. Inserting these back in:

    - (s&p)|T

5. And finally, simplifying:

    - T

The value of T (True) cannot be changed by an ""or"" operator, no matter what other logic operations are in the formula. Therefore, definitely, the simplified formula is T.",T,s

((x&(F|(F&(!(!((v|(!(y&(!(!F)))))&(!((F&(T&(F&T)))&F))))))))&(((!((!(T|F))|T))&T)&T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logic formula can be simplified in steps as follows:

Step 1: Simplify the constants
((F&T) = F), ((T|F) = T), ((F&F) = F), (!F = T), (!T = F)

Substitute these into the given logic expression:

((x&(F|(F&T)))&((!(F|T))&T))

Which simplifies to:

((x&(F|F))&(!F&T)) = ((x&F)&T)

Since anything ANDed with False (F) is False, the entire expression simplifies to False (F). This is because the operation 'logical and' requires both inputs to be True (T) for the output to be True (T). In this case, we have one input that is always False (F), so the output will always be False (F), regardless of the truth value of x. 

So, the simplified logic is:

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. ""|"" is binary OR operator which gives the result true if either of the argument is true. Hence, ""T | T"", ""T | F"", and ""F | T"" will result T, and ""F | F"" will be F.
2. ""&"" is binary AND operator which would give the result true if both the arguments are true. So, ""T & T"" will result in T, while ""T & F"", ""F & T"", and ""F & F"" will be F.
3. The NOT operator, denoted by '!', operates only on a single operand. ""!T"" is F and ""!F"" is T.

The expression simplifies as follows:

(((w|(w|((w|(f&F))|(w&((!((q|(T|(T|T)))&T))|(T&(T&(u|((F|T)&T)))))))))&((!(F|F))|F))|(F|T)).

=> ((w | (w | ((w | (F & F)) | (w & ((!((q | T) & T)) | (T & (T & (u | T)))))) & (T | F) | T.

=> (w | (w | ((w | F) | (w & ((!q) | T)) | T. 

Since for ‘|’, if one of the values is true the result is always true. The simplified value is T.",T,T

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Anything ORed (|) with True (T) is always True (T). Thus, reducing the statement to:
(o|(o&(o&(((F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T)|F)))|T) simplifies to T.

2. Anything ANDed (&) with True (T) is itself. Thus, this reduces:
(a|T)&T simplifies to a,T.

3. Any Not operator (!) on something ORed (|) with any False (F) is simply negation of that something. Thus, 
!(F|F)&T simplifies to !F&!F&T, which simplifies to F&T which is F (since anything ANDed (&) with False (F) is False (F)). 

4. Following arguments like above, we can simplify the statement, but since the end of the entire statement is connected with T through OR, the whole statement automatically becomes True (T), i.e.:
((o|(o&(o&(((F|(F|(F|(T&((a|T)&T)))))&T)|F))))|((v|(e|(T|(f&((F|(F&(!((F|F)&T))))|F)))))|T) simplifies to T.

2. Any value ""and"" with False is also False. This means you can simplify ((F&...) &((T|(T&(!(y&(T&F)))))|F) to ((F&...) &F), which also simplifies to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First note that anything AND with False (A&F) equals False and anything OR with True (A|T) equals True. 

So, we can radically simplify F&((!T)&T) to False (F&F = F) and then ((F&((!T)&T))|T)&F to False (F | T = T, T & F = F).

Also, (!((F&F)&(F|T))) simplifies to True, as ((F & F) & (F | T)) => (F & T) = False and hence, !(False) = True. 

Now, ((o|o)|o)&F simplifies to False (as anything & F = F).

So we can simplify F&(F|((((o|o)|o)&F)&True))&F) to just False. 

When we take all of this into account, the formula simplifies to: y | F | F which simplifies to y. 

So the simplified form of the logic formula is just 'y' which can be either True or False.",y,y
