We also solve [SM 8 9 6] - which results in 23, but since the SM operation is modulo 10 we use the remainder when 23 is divided by 10. Thus, [SM 8 9 6] results in 3.

Then we substitute these results back into the original formula, we get [SM 3 8 3].

Finally, we add the numbers together, 3 + 8 + 3 = 14, and apply the SM operation, using the remainder when 14 is divided by 10, which results in 4.
