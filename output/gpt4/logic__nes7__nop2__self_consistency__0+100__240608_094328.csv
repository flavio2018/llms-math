A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify using some basic rules: 

1. From ""(!F)"", we get ""T"". It means anything 'not False' is 'True.
2. From ""(F\|T)"", we get ""T"". Any logical OR operation with 'True' will always result in 'True'.
3. The boolean 'AND' operation between True and anything always results in the original value.
4. The boolean 'OR' operation with 'True' always results in 'True' no matter the other value.

Applying these, the logic formula simplifies to:

((T&(T&(y|T)))|T)

Simplifying further, we can substitute again 'OR' operation to return 'True':

(T&(T|T)|T)

This can be further simplified to:

(T&T|T)

2. (F&F) is equivalent to F as and operation with False is always False. Hence, ((!T)&T) is also equivalent to F because not True is False.

7. u&T is the same as u because and operation with True is equivalent to the other operand

Now, swap in F for the above expression in the original equation : ((((k|(F))))&T)&F)|(F&(!(!(!(F|(T&T)))))).

Fourthly, anything AND True is always the original value, so it simplifies to:
(k|F)|k
Lastly, within the brackets, k OR False is just k, so the formula simplifies to
k|k

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's clear up the constants: 
- (!T) means not True, which is False. 
- (F&T) means False and anything, which is always False.
- (!F) means not False, which is True. 
- e|e is simply e, because anything or the same thing is just the original thing.
- e|F is also just e, because anything or False result in the original thing. 

So we can replace these in the original expression:
((e|(((((e|e)|False)&T)|F)|(False&((False)|F))))&(True))

This simplifies to:
((e|(((((e)|False)&T)|F)|(False)))&(True))

(e or ((e & T)|False)) & True

(e or (e & True)) & True

(e or e) & True

This further simplifies to: 
e & True

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we can simplify the !F as T, so the formula becomes:

(((T)|T)|(!((!(!(!(l|T))))|(z&(T&(F&(F&F)))))).

Now, the operation (T|T) gives as T, whatever the second value might be. So the formula thus becomes:

T|(!((!(!(!(l|T))))|(z&(T&(F&(F&F)))))).

Now let's simplify inside the double negation (!(!(!(l|T)))). We know that any logical operation with T gives the other operand's value, so (l|T) becomes T:

T|(!((!(!!T))|(z&(T&(F&(F&F)))))).

Then, we have the double negation, which simplifies the !(!T) into T:

T|(!(T|(z&(T&(F&(F&F)))))).

If we simplify further, (T|(z&(T&(F&(F&F))))) becomes T, because we’re or-ing with T. So:

T|(!T).

Secondly, we know that anything and True is equal to that value, and anything and False is False. So:

(m|T) = T (m or True equals True) 
(a&T)= a (a and True is simply a)
(T&T)= T (True and True equals True)
(T&F)= F (True and False equals False)

Formula after substitutions:
((((a&T)&a)&T)|a)&F

Now we know that anything or itself is always itself. So (a|a) can be simplified to (a).

Any element AND T is itself too. So, ((((w|F)|(!T))&(T|T))|T) gives us (((w|F)&T)|T), which is equivalent to (w|T) or simply w.

Moving on, !! is equivalent to applying negation twice, which cancels out and returns the original element.

4) The expression T&T results in T, since the logical and between true and true is always true. 

5) !F equals T, because the negation of false is true.

6) Therefore, we can simplify further to: (!(T | (n&T) |T) & T).

7) T|T is T and T|(n&T) is also T regardless of the value of n.

8) Thus, we get: !(T) & T.

Step 1: Simplify !F to T

- F&T means that both should be True to give True. But F is false, so the overall will be False. Hence, F&T = F.
- F|T will be True as ‘or’ logical operation gives True if at least one is True. Hence, F|T = T.
- T&T is True as both are True. Hence, T&T = T.

Substituting those values back we get:

((T&(F|(T|T|F))) | (T&!(T&T)))

((T&(F|T)) | (T&!T))

Now, F|T is always True since 'or' operation gives True if at least one is True. And by the rule of logical 'and' operation, any value & T = that value itself. Also, T&!T is False as T (True) and not T (False) will always be False. So the formula simplifies to:
