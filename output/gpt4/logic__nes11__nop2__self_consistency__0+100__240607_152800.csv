The logical NOT operation on 'False' will always give 'True'. Hence !F simplifies to 'T'.
Therefore, the whole clause simplifies to: (F & T & F) | F, which simplifies to F.

Therefore, the whole statement ((((g|((((((F|F)&(((m&m)|m)|(!(F&F))))&(!F))&F)|F)&(!((F&F)&F))))|((g&T)|F))|(F|F)) can be re-written as (g | F) | (g | F), which is the same as g | F.

3. Negating a False '!F' will give us True 'T', and again negating T '!T' we get F. 

4. Double negation rule, !(!x) simply gives us x back.

Let's apply these logical simplifications:

So,

    - `T|(g&F)` reduces to `T|F` which is `T`

2. `e|e` is `e` and `e|F` is `e`
 
Substitute these results:

The expression becomes: `l&((l&((g&((((e&T)&e)|e)|T))|(k&T)))&(l|F))`

3. `k&T` and `'l' | F` are `k` and `l` respectively. 

So the expression is simplified to `l&((l&((g&((e&e)|e)|T))|k)&l)`.

4. `e&e` is `e` and `((e|e))` is also `e`. 

The expression then is `l&((l&((g&e|T))|k)&l)`.

5. Here `g&e|T` is `T`. 

The expression mentions `T` since anything ""`&`"" or ""`|`"" with `T` is itself.

So the expression now stands as `l&((l&T|k)&l)`, and this is further simplified as`l&((l|k)&l)`.

6. Now use the associativity of ""`&`"". The expression then becomes: `(l&l)|(l&k)`.

7. `l&l` is `l`. So finally, the expression is now simplified to `l|(l&k)`.

= (u|(u|F))

5. `((F&F)&F)` = `F`, because logical 'and' operator returns True if and only if all operands are True. 

6. `((u|(r|T))|((F&F)&F))` = `T`, because from point 4 and 5 we know that we have 'or' operation between True and False which will always give True. 

7. `(T&(z | (((F | T) | T) | (T & ((u | (r | T)) | ((F & F) & F))))))` = `T&T` = `T`, because we have from the points 2 and 6 that the inner brackets will give True and 'and' operation between True and any value will always give that value(in this case True).

8. `!(!(o | (T | F)))` = `!(!(o | T))` = `!(!o) = o`, because from point 1 we know that `(T | F)` will always be True and logical 'or' with any value and True will always be True. Furthermore, 'not' of 'not' any value will always give that value. 

9. `((!(!(o | (T | F)))) | F)` = `F|o` = `o`, because 'or' operation between False and any value will always give that value.

10. `(q | ((T & (z | (((F | T) | T) | (T & ((u | (r | T)) | ((F & F) & F)))))) | T)` = `q|T` = `T`, because from point 7 we have that the brackets will give True  and 'or' operation between True and any value will always give True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Let's simplify inner expressions first:

   From the formula `T | (!(!(!(F|(!F)))))`, the `F|(!F)` mathematically will result in `T` (since it is either `F or not F`, it always ends up as `T`). So, the formula becomes `T|(!(!(!T)))` which simplifies to `T|T`. Any value OR itself is itself, so it simplifies to `T`.

   Also, from the formula `(o|(!(T&F)))|F`, since `T&F` is `F` (because for `and`, both have to be true for it to be true), the formula becomes `(o|!F)|F` which simplifies to `(o|T)|F`. The result of `o or T` is always `T`, because `or` only needs one of them to be true for the result to be true. So, the formula simplifies to `T|F` which ultimately simplifies to `T`.

2. From the statement `b|(((!T)|F)&F)|T)`, since we already calculated `T`, the formula becomes `b|((!T)&F)|T`. The `!T` and `F` in `(!T)&F` result in `F`, so the formula becomes `b|F|T` which simplifies to `T`.

3. So, our original formula becomes `((z|(z|T))|F)|(T&F)`
   
4. Here, in `(z|(z|T))|F`, since the result of `z or T` is always `T` (because `or` only needs one of them to be true for it to be true), we get `(z|T)|F` which simplifies to `T|F` which ultimately simplifies to `T`. 

5. So the formula becomes `T|(T&F)`

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Anything ∧ F equals F. Therefore, F&T equals F, q&F equals F, and !T equals F.

So, the formula becomes:
(!((n&n)&(((e|(F|((F&F)|T)))&((((!(F&((F)|(T|F))))|F)|F)|F))&(!F)))).
  
2. Anything | T equals T. Therefore, (F&T) equals T. Also as Anything & anything equals itself, n&n is just n.
  
So, now formula becomes:
(!((n)&(((e|T))&((((!(F))|F)|F)|F))&(!F)))).
  
3. Anything & F equals F.

So, let's simplify all segments where F is present. Therefore, ((!(F))|F) simplifies to T and (((e|T))&F)&(!F) simplifies to F.

The simplified formula is :

Then the formula becomes:

Further simplifying:

(F&F) simplifies to F.

T|((l|F)|T) simplifies to T because anything OR with T is T.

(T|F) simplifies to T.

(F&F)&T simplifies to F because anything AND with F is F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We simplify the expression ""T|T"" within the first bracket. Since an OR operation with any True results in True, ""T|T"" simplifies to T
 => (t|(t&T)) - Here '(t&T)' simplifies to 't' as the value of T is always true. Hence '(t|T)' simplifies to t as well
2. Now consider the second big bracket. ""F|T"" is always True because an OR operation with any True results in True, hence ""p|F"" simplifies to ""p""
 => (t&p&F) | ((((T & (!(j|T))) & ((T & T) & T)) & T)) | t

3. ""(!(j|T))"" is False because NOT operation against any logic OR with True returns False

4. In the above sentence the middle operand (T & F & T) results in False because an AND operation with any False results in False

Second, (T | F) evaluates to T, and (!T) evaluates to F. Thus, the part (!T | T | F | m | T | F) simplifies to T. So we get:

((j & (a | (T & T & a | T))) | F) & T

Next, the expression (a & T & T) simplifies to a. Furthermore, (a | T) simplifies to T and (F | F) simplifies to F. This leaves us with:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, let's simplify expressions involving True and False. 

1. The logical AND of any value with False results in False, and the logical OR of any value with False does not change the value. 
2. The logical AND of any value with True does not change the value, and the logical OR of any value with True results in True. 
3. Not False (expressed as !F) is True, and not True (expressed as !T) is False.

Given these rules, we can simplify the provided formula as follows:

((((((F|((((F&F)|F)|T)|((((F&F)&(F&F))&T)|T)))&(r|(T|T)))|F)|T)&T)|(F&(!(d|(!F))))).

First, simplify within the deepest parentheses:

In the subexpression ""((((F&F)|F)|T)|((((F&F)&(F&F))&T)|T))"", both ""(F&F)"" are False. Replace them:

""((((F|F)|T)|((((False)&(False))&T)|T))"".

Next, replace ""(False&False)&T"" with False and (F|F) also with False:

""((False|T)|((False&T)|T))"".

The replacement leads to:

""((False|T)|(False|T))"", which simplifies to ""T|T"" which is True.

The initial formula becomes:
((((True)&(r|(T|T)))|F)|T)&T)|(F&(!(d|(!F)))).

Replace (r|(T|T)) as r|T which is simply True:

(((True&True)|F)|T)&T)|(F&(!(d|(!F)))).

Then, the sub-expression ""(True&True)|F"" becomes True. 

So the formula simplifies to:

(T|T)&T)|(F&(!(d|(!F)))). 

This further simplifies to:

(T&T)| (F & (!(d | T))).

The sub-expression ""(!((d|T)))"" simplifies to False, because ""Not (True)"" equals False. And F&F is simply False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We are given that the values T and F represent True and False respectively.

3. The term F|(z|(F|T))) simplifies to T irrespective of the value of Z. 

4. So, the whole term ((((u&u)&F)&T)&(F|(z|(F|T))))&T) simplifies to F&T which is F.

5. Hence t&F evaluates to F. Then we have F|T which evaluates to T.

6. Also, !(T&((t&T)|T))) results to !T because the right side ((t&T)|T) evaluates to T, then (w&!T) as w&F since !T is F. We get F. 

7. Hence we have T&F. This is F.

2. Again, all operations involving F and logical OR yield the other operand's value. Thus, F|T equals to T.

3. Additionally, all operations involving the T value and a logical OR yield T. Therefore:

Further, the ""AND"" operation with False results in False and the ""OR"" operation with False has no effect. Thus, F&((F&(T&(T&T)))&F) simplifies to F&F which, in turn, simplifies to F. 

As previously explained, using OR (the symbol '|') with F has no effect. Thus, w|(F&) simplifies to just w.

Then, let's consider u&(u&F). Since ANDing anything with False results in False, this simplifies to u&F, which simplifies to F. 

Thus, the initial w|(u&(u&F)) simplifies to w|F, which simplifies to w.

The OR operation using True (|(u&(u&F)))|T) will always result in True, regardless of the value of the other operand. Thus, all of the previous operations OR'ed with T reduce to T. 

Finally, let's simplify F|(T&F). As explained previously, anything ANDed with False results in False, thus, T&F simplifies to F. That leaves us with F|F which simplifies to F.

Lastly, let's AND the two expressions we have left, which results in T&F. As mentioned before, anything ANDed with False is always False. Therefore, the simplified logic formula is F.",F,F

    (!F) = T (not operator makes F to true)
    ((T|F) = T (any value or True is always true)
    ((F&T) = F (false and any value is always false).

2. Then, simplification of terms under NOT operation such as `!((F|F)&T)` becomes `!F` which is T.

3. Also, `(((b|b)&(b|b))&b)` is basically equivalent to `b`.

4. So, `((d|(((((b|b)&(b|b))&b)|F)&F))|(F|(d&(((!T)&T)&F))))` becomes `(F|(d&F))`, which ultimately becomes F.

3. (((r&((((n&F)&F)&F)|T))&r)&r)&(F|(((((s|(!(((T|T)|(!T))&T)))|s)|s)&s)&F))).

4. N & F = F, therefore, (((n&F)&F)&F) = F.

5. (((r&(F|T))&r)&r)&(F|(((((s|(!(((T|T)|(!T))&T)))|s)|s)&s)&F))).

6. F | T = T, so we get:

7. (((r&T)&r)&r)&(F|(((((s|(!(((T|T)|(!T))&T)))|s)|s)&s)&F))).

8. R&T = r, as anything 'AND T' will always be itself because T means true, making the equation:

9. ((r&r)&r)&(F|(((((s|(!(((T|T)|(!T))&T)))|s)|s)&s)&F))).

10. We also know that any variable 'AND' with itself will always be itself, which simplifies to:

11. r&(F|(((((s|(!(((T|T)|(!T))&T)))|s)|s)&s)&F))).

Therefore, a | F simplifies to a as we are oring value F, which is false.

2. Anything AND with False (`value&F`) always results to 'False' because 'False' changes the outcome of an AND operation to 'False'. Let's simplify `F&F` to `F` and `(F&F)&F` to `F`. And any value AND with True (`value&T`) is just the value itself. Here `s&T` simplifies to `s`.

3. Anything OR with itself (`value|value`) is just the value itself as this does not change the operation's outcome. So, let's simplify `s|s` to `s` and `s&s` to `s`.

4. Anything AND with itself (`value&value`) is just the value because this doesn't change the operation's outcome either. Here, `k&k` simplifies to `k`.

5. The 'not' of 'False' (`!F`) is 'True'. This is because it's the opposite value of 'False'. So simplify `!F` to `T`.

After these simplifications, we get `(s&((s&(s&(s&k|T))|s)&T)|(c&F))`. 

6. Again applying rule 2 simplifies `c&F` to `F`.

After these simplifications, we get `(s&((s&(s&(s&k|T))|s)&T)|F)`.

After these simplifications, we get `s&((s&k)|s)`.

- (T&T) = T, 
- (F&T) = F, 
- (T|T) = T, 
- (F|T) = T, 
- (T&F) = F, 
- (F&F) = F 
- and (!T) = F, (!F) = T.

Next, let's apply them into the given logic:

1. We simplify the inner parentheses first: 

- (T|(T|T)) = T according to (T|T) rule, 
- (n&F) = F according to (T&F) rule,
- (F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F)))) = (F|((T)&(F))) = (F|F) = F according to (F|T) and (T&F) rules.

2. Then, we have:

- (!(!(T&(T|T)))) = T
- (!(F|(!(F)))) = T
- (F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T)) = F
- ((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T) = T
- (j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T)) = j
- ((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F) = (T&(!i|T)) = T 
- ((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T) = T

Finally, we have 
((j&((F&((!(!(T&(T|T))))&T))|T))&(((T&(!(i|(!(F|(((F|T)|F)&(F&(n&F))))))))|F)|T)) = (j & T) = j. So, the simplified logic formula is j.",j,j
99,logic,self_consistency,(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((s&(T|(!(T|T))))&s)|(s|(s&((((o&(!(!T)))&((h|(((!T)|T)|(F&(T|F))))|T))&F)&T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","- Since T|T gives T and !T gives F, (!(T|T)) simplifies to F. 
- Because T or F gives T, the simplified logic formula becomes s & T & s. And &-operation with True doesn't change the value so it remains as s&s which also equals to s.

Now, look at the second part of the expression:
- !(!T) simplifies to T.
- (!T | T) simplifies to T. 
- T | F simplifies to T, and (F & (T | F)) simplifies to F.
- So, ((h | T) | F) simplifies to T. 
- (o & T) simplifies to o.
- Given that any operation with False, ((o & T) & F) is F.

Therefore, the entire second expression becomes s. 

Combining both parts the simplified logic formula becomes: s | s, which simplifies to s.",s,s
