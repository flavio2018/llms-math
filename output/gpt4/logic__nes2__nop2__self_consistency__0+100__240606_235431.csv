Replace (g&F) in the original formula with F. So ((h&T)&(g&F)) simplifies to ((h&T)&F).

Next, remember again that the logical and operation returns True only when both values are True. Because 'F' is always False, regardless of the value of the first part of the expression (h&T), the whole expression will always be False.
