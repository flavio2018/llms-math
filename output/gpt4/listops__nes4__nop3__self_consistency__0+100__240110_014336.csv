- MAX [MIN 5 0 2] [SM 2 6 3] 5] = 5, because the maximum between the minimum of (5,0,2) which is 0, the sum modulo 10 of (2,6,3) which is 1, and 5, is 5.
- MAX 4 [MIN 3 6 3] [MIN 4 5 1] = 4, because the maximum between 4, the minimum of (3,6,3) which is 3, and the minimum of (4,5,1) which is 1, is 4.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, evaluate the operators inside the brackets.

[MIN [MAX 7 [MIN 0 2 8] [SM 9 2 0]]
Here, [MIN 0 2 8] would give result of 0.
[SM 9 2 0] would give result 9+2+0 = 11, but as it's modulo 10, the final result is 1.
Then the expression becomes [MIN [MAX 7 0 1]]. So, [MAX 7 0 1] gives result of 7.
Therefore, the final result is 7.

Then, evaluate another sub-expression:

[MIN 2 [MAX 0 7 3] [SM 0 3 3]]
Here, [MAX 0 7 3] would give result of 7.
[SM 0 3 3] would give result 0+3+3 = 6, but as it's modulo 10, the final result is 6.
Then the expression becomes [MIN 2 7 6], hence it gives the result 2.

Moving on to another nested expression:

[SM 4 [MAX 1 5 8] [MIN 9 6 9]]
Here, [MAX 1 5 8] would give result of 8.
[MIN 9 6 9] would give result of 6.
Then the expression becomes [SM 4 8 6], therefore it gives 4+8+6 = 18, but as it's modulo 10, the final result is 8.

Moving to the next biggest expression:

[SM [SM 2 9 2] [SM 8 8 4] 9]

MAX 7 0 3 = 7 (Maximum among 7, 0 and 3).
MAX 7 2 8 = 8 (Maximum among 7, 2 and 8).

Next, compute the MIN and MAX operations:
MIN 5 2 = 2 (Minimum among 5 and 2).
MAX 2 7 8 = 8 (Maximum among 2, 7 and 8).

Then the expression simplifies to:
MIN [MIN 2 8] 0 [MIN [SM [MIN 9 3 0] [MIN 4 7 5] 8] 6 [MIN 2 [MAX 9 7 8] [MIN 9 5 8]]] 

Now perform the remaining inner operations:
MIN 2 8 = 2 (Minimum among 2 and 8).
MIN 9 3 0 = 0 (Minimum among 9, 3 and 0).
MIN 4 7 5 = 4 (Minimum among 4, 7 and 5).
MAX 9 7 8 = 9 (Maximum among 9, 7 and 8).
MIN 9 5 8 = 5 (Minimum among 9, 5 and 8).

Insert these results in the expression:

This gives:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's break down the individual components of the operation.

Starting with [MIN 1 3 8], the minimum is 1.
[SM 4 5 4] means we add 4 + 5 + 4 = 13, but SM stands for sum modulo 10, so the result is 3.

So [MAX [MIN 1 3 8] [SM 4 5 4] 9] is [MAX 1 3 9], which results in 9.

On the other hand, [SM 1 9 9] is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19, but because of the modulo operator the result is 9.

[MIN [SM 1 9 9] 2 [MAX 9 6 7]] is [MIN 9 2 9], resulting in 2.

Hence, [SM 0 [MAX [MIN 1 3 8] [SM 4 5 4] 9] [MIN [SM 1 9 9] 2 [MAX 9 6 7]]] is [SM 0 9 2], resulting in 1.

[SM 3 1 3] is 7.  
[MAX 2 8 5] is 8. 
Therefore, [MAX [SM 3 1 3] [MAX 2 8 5] 6] is [MAX 7 8 6], which results in 8.

[MAX 6 8 8] is 8. 
[MAX 5 1 0] is 5.
Consequently, [MIN [MAX 6 8 8] 1 [MAX 5 1 0]] is [MIN 8 1 5], resulting in 1.

So, [MIN [MAX [SM 3 1 3] [MAX 2 8 5] 6] [MIN [MAX 6 8 8] 1 [MAX 5 1 0]] 5] is [MIN 8 1 5], yielding 1.

Then, resolve [SM 6 6 7], which equals to (6+6+7) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9. The expression becomes: [SM 8 [MAX 9 [SM 4 9 2] [SM [MIN 4 9 2] 8 [SM 9 8 7]]] 8].

Solving [MIN 4 9 2], it equals to 2. The expression becomes: [SM 8 [MAX 9 5 [SM 2 8 [SM 9 8 7]]] 8].

[MIN [MAX [MAX 0 3 1] 3 [SM 6 4 6]] 0 [SM 9 [MIN 7 3 7] [MIN 9 4 6]]]

MAX 0 3 1 -> 3
SM 6 4 6 -> 6 (6+4+6 mod 10)
MIN 7 3 7 -> 3
MIN 9 4 6 -> 4

Then replacing these results in the part expression, we have:
[MIN [MAX 3 3 6] 0 [SM 9 3 4]]

We compute the next level of operations:
MAX 3 3 6 -> 6
SM 9 3 4 -> 6 (9 + 3 + 4 mod 10)

Re-inserting these results, the first part becomes:
[MIN 6 0 6]

Finally, the result of the first part produces:

For the second part,

[MIN [SM [MAX 2 8 5] 1 [SM 0 9 7]] [MIN [MAX 0 6 6] 1 [MIN 2 4 2]] 5]

Begin with the innermost operations once again:
MAX 2 8 5 -> 8
SM 0 9 7 -> 6 (0 + 9 + 7 mod 10)
MAX 0 6 6 -> 6
MIN 2 4 2 -> 2

We perform the next operations:
SM 8 1 6 -> 5 (8 + 1 + 6 mod 10)
MIN 6 1 2 -> 1

Inserting these values back in, the second part is:
[MIN 5 1 5]

Finally, the result of the second part computes as:

After substituting these values, expression turns into:

Now, evaluate the below expressions,

MIN 4 2 8 = MIN(4, 2, 8) = 2
MIN 7 1 0 = MIN(7, 1, 0) = 0

MIN 7 1 0 = MIN(7, 1, 0) = 0
MIN 6 8 4 = MIN(6, 8, 4) = 4

So, the expression simplifies to:

[SM 9 [MIN 0 4 6] [MIN 4 [SM 2 0 0] [MIN 1 8 4]]].

Then, compute the remaining SM operations:

The expression now simplifies to:

[MAX 1 7 6] = 7, because 7 is the largest number.

[SM 1 5 7] = 3, because (1+5+7) = 13 and 13 mod 10 = 3.

Then, the sum operation of 7, 5, and 0 results in 2, and we compare this with 4, giving us another MIN which is 2.

So we have the sum of 2, 9, and 4 in modulo 10, which is 5.

Secondly, we find the MAX operand of 3, 1, and 7, which is 7, and the MAX operand of 1, 5, and 6, which is 6.

After this, we find the MIN operand of 0, 2, and 0, which is 0, and the MAX operand of 8, 8, and 0, which is 8.
Comparing 0 and 8 with 7, the MIN operation results in 0.

We then take the MAX of our results from the previous two MIN operations, which gives us the MAX of 1 and 0, and the result is 1.

[SM 6 9 0] = (6 + 9 + 0) mod 10 = 15 mod 10 = 5
[SM 7 4 0] = (7 + 4 + 0) mod 10 = 11 mod 10 = 1
[MIN 1 2 1] = 1 (which is the minimum among 1, 2, 1)

Thus,

[MIN [MIN 5 5 3] [MAX 1 1 3] 6].

- [MAX 4 7 8] = 8
- [MIN 7 1 5] = 1
- [MIN 4 1 2] = 1
- [MIN 8 8 6] = 6
- [SM 6 6 4] = 6 (16 modulo 10 = 6)
- [MIN 5 6 9] = 5
- [MAX 0 4 1] = 4

Replacing these in the original expression, we get:
[MIN [SM [SM 3 9 8] [MAX 1 2 1]] 6] [MIN [MIN [MIN 6 6 8] 6 [MIN 5 5 4]] 7]

Next, calculate the values for the second level of nested expressions:
- [SM 3 9 8] = 0 (Adding up the numbers gives 20, and 20 modulo 10 is 0)
- [MAX 1 2 1] = 2
- [MIN 6 6 8] = 6
- [MIN 5 5 4] = 4

So, the expression now becomes:

Next, calculate the values for the next level:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate any expressions inside square brackets starting from the most inner ones:

[MIN [SM 1 4 4] [MIN 8 0 3] 3] = [MIN 9 0 3] = [MIN 9 0] = 0

[SM [SM 1 9 2] 9 [MAX 0 9 3]] = [SM 2 9 9] = 0

[MAX 6 5 2] = 6
[MIN 6 7 1] = 1
[MIN 8 [MAX 6 5 2] [MIN 6 7 1]] = [MIN 8 6 1] = 1

[SM 2 5 9] = 6

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the operations inside the nested brackets. 

The smallest of 1, 9, and 2 in the MIN operation is 1.
The sum of 4, 6, and 8 in the SM operation is 18, but it's modulo 10, so the result is 8.
Therefore, [SM 7 [MIN 1 9 2] [SM 4 6 8]] becomes [SM 7 1 8], which is 7 + 1 + 8 = 16, modulo 10, giving 6.

Next, for the MAX operation, we add 5, 8, and 4, which totals 17. However, using modulo 10 gives 7. 
The smallest of 6, 0, and 6 in the MIN operation is 0.
Therefore, [MAX 7 [SM 5 8 4] [MIN 6 0 6]] becomes [MAX 7 7 0], and the maximum value is 7. 

Now we have [MIN 4 [SM 3 6 7], which is [MIN 4 16], yielding a minimum of 4.

For the second part of the original expression,
In the inner most MIN operation, 1 is the smallest value among 5, 5, and 1.
So, [MIN [MIN 5 5 1] 8 [SM 0 5 5]] simplifies to [MIN 1 8 10], out of which 1 is the smallest.
The MAX of 2, 2, and 8 is 8.
The sum of 8, 5, and 9 in the SM operation is 22, but modulo 10, that's 2.
Therefore, [SM 9 [MAX 2 2 8] [SM 8 5 9]] simplifies to [SM 9 8 2], which is 9 + 8 + 2 = 19, then modulo 10, which gives 9.
Now we have [MIN 1 9 9], which yields 1.

- MIN [MAX 8 8 7] 4 [MAX 9 9 2] -> 4 (since MAX 8 8 7 = 8 and MAX 9 9 2 = 9, but 4 is the smallest)

Here, the inner-most operations are [SM 6 8 7], [SM 5 9 9], [MIN 9 1 4], [MIN 0 7 8], [MAX 3 4 2], and [MAX 5 2 0]. Let's solve each one at a time:

[SM 6 8 7] = 6 + 8 + 7 mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1,
[SM 5 9 9] = 5 + 9 + 9 mod 10 = 23 mod 10 = 3, 
[MIN 9 1 4] = minimum of 9, 1, 4 = 1,
[MIN 0 7 8] = minimum of 0, 7, 8 = 0,
[MAX 3 4 2] = maximum of 3, 4, 2 = 4, 
[MAX 5 2 0] = maximum of 5, 2, 0 = 5.

Now, substitute those results back into the equation:

[SM [MAX 5 [MAX 4 1 3] [SM 3 [MAX 4 4 4] 3]] [MAX 5 [MIN 1 1 0] [SM 0 4 5]] 1]

Now, continue to solve the inner-most operations which are now [MAX 4 1 3], [MAX 4 4 4], [MIN 1 1 0] and [SM 0 4 5]:

[MAX 4 1 3] = maximum of 4, 1, 3 = 4,
[MAX 4 4 4] = maximum of 4, 4, 4 = 4,
[MIN 1 1 0] = minimum of 1, 1, 0 = 0,
[SM 0 4 5] = 0 + 4 + 5 mod 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9.

Inserting these results back into the equation, we get:

[SM [MAX 5 [MAX 4 4] [SM 3 4 3]] [MAX 5 [MIN 1 1 0] 9] 1]

Solving the inner-most operations this time we get [MAX 4 4], [SM 3 4 3] and [MAX 5 0 9] which gives us:

[SM 3 4 3] = 3 + 4 + 3 mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0,
[MAX 5 0 9] = maximum of 5, 0, 9 = 9.

Moving forth, executing [MAX 5 4 0]  the equation becomes:

[MAX 6 9 2] = 9, [MAX 0 0 5] = 5; so we get:

Now, simplify the MIN and MAX operations inside the SM operations.
[MIN 3 0 1] = 0, [MAX 8 7 5] = 8, [MIN 6 1 6] = 1; so we get:
5 9 [SM [SM 0 0 8] [SM 1 [SM 9 9 8] 7] 5]

Then, simplify the SM operations.
[SM 0 0 8] = 8, [SM 9 9 8] = 6; so we get:
5 9 [SM 8 [SM 1 6 7] 5]

Now, simplify the SM operation inside the SM operation.
[SM 1 6 7] = 4; so we get:
5 9 [SM 8 4 5]

SM 4 9 2 = 5.

So the initial expression can be rewritten as:
[MAX [MAX 3 [MIN 5 9 9] [MAX 5 [MAX 1 1 0] 4]] [MAX [MIN 1 [MIN 4 2 8] 5] 5 [MIN 4 5 [MAX 6 2 7]]] 0].

Next, we calculate the minimum operation:
MIN 5 9 9 = 5,
MIN 4 2 8 = 2,
MIN 4 5 = 4.

So the expression can be rewritten as:
[MAX [MAX 3 5 [MAX 5 [MAX 1 1 0] 4]] [MAX 1 5 4 [MAX 6 2 7]] 0].

Next, we calculate the maximum operation:
MAX 3 5 = 5,
MAX 5 1 0 = 5,
MAX 5 4 = 5,
MAX 6 2 7 = 7.

So the expression can be rewritten as:
[MAX 5 [MAX 5 4] 7 0].

Finally, 
MAX 5 5 4 7 0 = 7.

So, the result is 7.",7,5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's calculate the inner-most bracket operations:

- [MAX 0 3 7] => 7
- [MIN 7 7 0] => 0
- [MIN 0 2 7] => 0
- [MAX 2 8 0] => 8
- [MIN 0 5 9] => 0
- [MIN 5 4 4] => 4
- [MAX 6 6 6] => 6

Substitute these values back into the expression:

MIN [SM 9 MIN 9 7 0 MIN 0 6 8] MAX [SM SM 1 7 3 0 6] 1 MAX 4 7 6

Calculate the next MIN and MAX operations:

- MIN 9 7 0 => 0
- MIN 0 6 8 => 0
- MAX 4 7 6 => 7

Substitute these values:

MIN [SM 9 0 0] MAX [SM SM 1 7 3 0 6] 1 7

Calculate the next SM operation:

- SM 1 7 3 => (1+7+3)mod10 = 1

Substitute this value:

MIN [SM 9 0 0] MAX 1 1 7

Calculate the next MIN and MAX operations:

- MIN SM 9 0 0 => SM 9 0 0
- MAX 1 1 7 => 7

Substitute these values:

SM 9 0 0 7

Then finally calculate the last SM operation:

- SM 9 0 0 7 => (9+0+0+7)mod10 = 6

So, the result is 6.",6,6

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's compute the values inside the most internal square brackets:

SM 1 7 1 = (1+7+1)%10 = 9, SM 7 8 3 = (7+8+3)%10 = 8, SM 0 9 2 = (0+9+2)%10 = 1

MIN 2 0 6 = 0, MIN 0 9 9 = 0, MIN 3 3 3 = 3 

MAX 1 0 7 = 7, MAX 5 5 9 = 9 

Now, let's substitute these results back into the original expression:

MAX 9 [MIN [SM 9 9 3] 6 [SM 0 0 1]] [MAX [SM 7 9 3] 5 [MAX 8 8 1]] 

Let's now compute the new operations inside square brackets:

SM 9 9 3 = (9+9+3)%10 = 1, SM 0 0 1 = (0+0+1)%10 = 1, SM 7 9 3 = (7+9+3)%10 = 9 

MIN 1 6 1 = 1 

MAX 9 5 8 = 9 

Substitute these results gives us:

MAX 9 1 9 

Finally, the maximun number amongst these is:
