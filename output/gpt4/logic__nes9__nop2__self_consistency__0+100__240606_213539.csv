A: Let's think step-by-step.","First consider the expression (F&T). This represents a logical 'and' between False and any value. No matter what the other value is the result will always be False as with logical 'and' both values need to be True for the result to be True. This applies every time this expression appears, it can be replaced with F. 

Next, (T&F) is also False for the same reason, it can also be replaced with F. 

Also, the expression (F|T) stands for a logical 'or' between False and True. The result of an 'or' operation is True if at least one of the values is True, so (F|T) is actually T. 

We can then see that (T|F) is also T for the same reasons.

The expression (r&F) is again False. 

Step by step, we substitute these simplified expressions in:

((((T&(F&T))&T)|(!(T|((F&(F|T))|(h&(((r&F)|F)|(x&(b&F))))))))|(F&T))),

((((T&F)&T)|(!(T|((F&T)|(h&((F|F)|(x&F))))))|F))),

(F | !(T & !h & !x)) | F),

(F | (!T | h | x)) | F,

F | F | !T | h | x,

F | !T | h | x,

At this point we can see that the expression (!T | h | x) is True if any of these three elements is True. Since the result of logical 'or' operations is True if at least one of the values is True, and we follow the rule that anything 'or' with False is itself, this expression simplifies to:

(F&F) converts to F

4. Now, let's see this part: (b|F)|b; it simplifies to (b)|b which is simply b

- T OR T in (i&(T|T)) is equivalent to T.
- T OR F in (i&(T|F)) is also equivalent to T.
- The expression F OR (!F) is a tautology, it is always T (True).
- & and | operators are associative and commutative, so it does not matter in which order you use them.

So, the expression simplifies to:

-((F&T)|T)&&(i|(((i&T)|F)&T)|T))
This simplifies to:

-((F|T)&&i)
- Because by De Morgan's laws, not (A and B) is equivalent to (not A or not B), and not (A or B) is equivalent to (not A and not B).
- False and anything (F&T) is always False, so it simplifies to:

-((F|T)&&i). which simplifies to:

-(F|i).
- Since anything or True (F|T) is always true, this simplifies to:

Now, we can simplify the expression (b & (b | b)) to simply b, because b & b = b, and b or b = b. Also, the expression (r | F) can be simplified to r, because any value OR False = the value itself. And r & r simplifies to r and any value OR True is always True. So our expression now is:

(b|((b&b)|b))|(((b&(w|T))|F)|b).

- (y&F) is F as something and false is false.
 
- (F&T) is F as false and something is false.

Therefore the expression simplifies further to (F|(F&T)&T)).

   (((((t&((t|((t&T)|t))&T))|F)&F)&(F|(T&T)))|T)

   (((((t&t)|F)&F)&T)|T)

6. t&t = t, as we had already discussed. Also (x|F) = x, because logical OR operation with False doesn't change the result. It gives us:

Also note that when there's a chain of & or | operations, you can apply these identities to each operand separately. For example, if we have (x|y|T), we can simplify it to (T|T) by applying the x|T is T identity to both x and y, and then simplify (T|T) to T.

Following these rules, the given logic formula can be simplified as follows:

2. Secondly, simplify the logical ands with False - any expression AND False (`X & F`) is False, while False AND any expression (`F&X`) is also False:

    (((((F&(T|(F))))|((T)|F))|F)&F)|T|(T|F)).

3. Solve the logical ors that involve True or False. `X|T` is True and `F|X` is X:

    (((T|F))|F)|T|T|F = T.

This simplifies the formula to (!((!(i|T))|T))&(((((k&(T&F))|T)|F)&F)|F).

i|T is always True, because something or True is True. 
Furthermore the negative of True is False, so (!(!(i|T))) equates to (not(not(True))) which is still True.

This simplifies the formula into True&(((((k&(T&F))|T)|F)&F)|F).

Now (((k&(T&F))|T)|F) equals k&F. Because anything and False is False, and False or with True is True. 

Thus the formula simplifies to True&((True&F)|F). This equates to True&(F|F) which is True&F and finally is F. 

Thus our simplified expression is:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Bring down parts of the formula which contain no F and T to simplify later: 

   ((F|(!F))) = T because False OR Not False is always True.

   (((F|T)|T)) = T because False OR True is always True.

   (T|(F|F)) = T because True OR False is always True.

So the formula becomes:

   !((!(F&T)|((k& (k&T|k)&T)|T)) & T)

2. Reduce the argument again:

   (F&T) = F because False AND True is always False.
   
So the formula simplifies to:

    !((!F|((k & (k&T|k)&T) | T)) & T)
   
3. Reduce argument within the nested brackets:

   (k & (k&T|k)) = k because something AND itself is always that something.

So, the formula becomes:

    !((!F | (k & T) | T) & T)
    
   
4. Reduce the argument within the brackets using the rule of negation:

    (!F) = T since the negation of False is True.
   
So, the formula becomes

    (!((T | (k & T) | T) & T))
   
5. Further simplify using the rule of idempotence. This rule says that a statement OR itself is just that statement:

   ((T | (k & T) | T) & T) = T because True OR Anything is always True.

So, the formula ultimately simplifies to:

2. `a & F` is always `F`, no matter what `a` is. Accordingly, the full expression `c & F` is `F`.

3. Similarly, we have `a & T` always equals to `a`. Thus, we simplify the expression to the original `r`.

4. `!(!T)` negates `T` twice, making the expression itself `T` again.

5. With these simplifications, the initial formula `(((r|((f&((((T|F)|(c&F))&T)|F))&F))|r)&(F&(F&((f&(!(!(T|T))))&F))))` turns into `(((r|(F&R))|r)&(F&(F&(f&T&F))))`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. In logic, F&X is always equivalent to F. This is because ""False AND anything"" is always False. We can use this to simplify (F&((F|F)&(!F))) to F. Similarly, (T|X) is always equivalent to T since ""True OR anything"" is always True. So, (T|(F&((F|F)&(!F)))) becomes T.
2. Then, when we have T&X, this is always equivalent to X. Thus, T&(((T|(F&((F|F)&(!F))))|F)|((T&((F|F)|T))|T)) simplifies to (((T|(F&((F|F)&(!F))))|F)|((T&((F|F)|T))|T)) which simplifies further to T.
3. !F is equivalent to T and F&T is always equivalent to F. It then follows that !((T|F)&F) simplifies to T.

   (F|((((((a&(a|(a|a)))&T)&a)&F)|F)&(!(F|(T|(i&(((F|F)&F)&F)))))).

2. Then, (a&(a|(a|a))) can be simplified to a, because any literal value ORed with itself matches the value itself; therefore, the formula becomes: 

   (F|((((a&T)&a)&F)|F)&(!(F|(T|(i&(((F|F)&F)&F)))))).

3. Next, (a&T)&a simplifies to a (since a AND True is always a), so we'll get:

   (F|((a&F)|F)&(!(F|(T|(i&(((F|F)&F)&F)))))).

4. However, (a&F) is always F as anything AND False equals False: 

   (F|(F|F)&(!(F|(T|(i&(((F|F)&F)&F)))))).

5. This allows us to simplify the formula further: F|(F|F) is also F, because anything OR False equals that same thing:

First, we observe that:
(F &(F|(F|F))) simplifies to F, because the logical AND of False with any other value is False.

Then:
(((n | F) & T)) simplifies to n, because the logical OR of False with any value is that value and the logical AND of True with any value is that value.

- There are two identities of ""logical or"" (represented by |), which are:

- Double negative, represented by !!, cancels out, meaning !!X = X;
- And (T&F) is always equal to F and (T|F) is always equal to T.

7. (F|F) simplifies to F following the rule F | X = F
8. The simplified formula at this point is: ((!F)|F)&T|(T|F)

9. (!F) or F is a tautology and simplifies to: T

- F|F is equivalent to F.
- T|T is equivalent to T.

So, we could shorten the formula to:

Next, we can simplify even further:

- T&F is equivalent to F, no matter what T (True) is anded with F (False) it results False.
- We know (h&T)&F is False from above, so !((h&T)&F) is equivalent to T.

So, our formula becomes:

Given:

- F&X is equivalent to F for any X, because anything ""anded"" with F (False) results in F.
- T&T is equivalent to T.
- Finally, using De Morgan's laws, we can simplify the inside of the parentheses. We have to invert each operand and replace ""and"" by ""or"" and ""or"" by ""and"". So, !(T&(u&T)) becomes (!T | !(u&T)) and !(T&T) becomes (!T | !T). But as we said before, T&T is simply T, so we can simplify !(T&T) to F.

Now our formula looks like this:

2) The logical AND operation with T and any other literal doesn't affect that literal's value. So, k & T simply equals k.

2. (True | T) simplifies to True (since if either True or T is True, the result is True).

As a result, the part ((!F) | T) simplifies to True.

3. (((F&((!F)|F))&T) simplifies to ((F&True)&T) which can be simplified to False (because we're doing a logical and with False -- F -- and T).

4. The part with (F|(F&((T|T)|F))) simplifies to (F|F) which equals to F.

5. Then, ((((q&T)|(((F&((!F)|F))&T)|(F|(F&((T|T)|F)))))|(T|T))|F) simplifies to ((q&T)|False)|F which is further simplified to (q&T)|F. As F or anything equals the anything, this expression simplifies to (q&T).

So, (F|T) = True (T), (F&T) = False (F), (f&F) = False (F), (!T)= False (F), (!F) = True (T)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Inside the deepest parentheses, we have (F|(T|T)) which simplifies to (F|T) since (T|T) is true. (F|T) is equivalent to true because of the OR operator – if only one part of an OR clause is true, the entire clause is true.

2) Replacing the step above in original equation will give us, !(((F& (o&(F& T))) |F)) |T| ((a | (!(F& T)& F)) & F).

3) (F& T) simplifies to F as for AND operator to be true, both sides need to be true. But F equals false, hence (F& T) is F.

4) Replacing the step above in equation gives !((F & (o&F)) |F)| T| ((a| (F & F)) & F).

5) Now, (o&F) simplifies to F because only one side of the & clause is true. So the entire clause is false which is F. The same goes for (F & F) - this is F.

6) The equation becomes !((F & F) |F)| T|((a| F) & F).

7) (F & F) simplifies to F because, again, for an AND operator, both sides need to be true. And for (a| F), it simplifies to a because only one side of an OR needs to be true. So if the variable a is true, (a| F) is true; if a is false, (a| F) is false. 

8) Therefore, !((F) |F)| T|(a & F).

9) (F |F) simplifies to F because (F |F) is just false. (a & F) simplifies to F because only one side of an AND needs to be false.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. F&F is obviously False. Hence, !(F&F) is True. Therefore, ((((!(F&F))&F)|T)|T) is also True because anything or True always gives True. 
Hence, (!((((!(F&F))&F)|T)|T))) is False.
Therefore, our equation will be simplified to: 
((o|F)&(o|(o&(o&(o|((F|(F&F))|(F|False)))))))

2. Similarly, ((F|(F&F))&(F|False)) is also False. So, our equation then become:
((o|F)&(o|(o&(o&(o|False)))))

3. o|False will be equal to o. So it will result in:
((o|F)&(o|(o&(o&o))))

4. The expression (o&o) equals o. Hence the above expression will simplify to:

Then, (T & (k & F)) simplifies to F regardless of the value of k.

Next, (F|F)&F equals to F.
((p & !(F)) simplifies to p, because the not F (!F) is always True, so the statement is equal to p AND True, which equals p.
(F | !(F|(T&F))).  T&F equals to False, hence !(F|F) equals to True, so the statement equals to (F | True) which equals to T (True)

1. Any formula AND-ed with False (F) gives False:

2. Any formula OR-ed with False gives the formula itself:

3. Any formula AND-ed with True gives the formula itself: 
     f&T = f
   
4. Any formula OR-ed with True gives True:
     f|T = T
   
5. The negation of False is True: 
     !F = T

6. The negation of True is False: 
     !T = F

Let's apply these rules step-by-step.

First, simplify the innermost expressions:

- The expression (f&f) simplifies to f.
- The expression ((f&(f&f))|F) simplifies to f|F which equals to f.
- The expression (F|T) simplifies to T.
- The expression (T|T) simplifies to T.
- The expression (F|(F|F)) simplifies to F|F which equals to F.

So, the overall expression becomes:
((f&f)|(!(F|(((g|F)&T)|g)&F))&F)

Let's continue with the next simplification steps:

- The expression (g|F) simplifies to g|F which equals to g.
- The next expression to simplify would be (((g|F)&T)|g) which simplifies to ((g&T)|g), which equals to (g|g) = g.

So, the overall formula becomes:
((f&f)|( (!F|((g&F)&F))&F))

Next, we simplify further:

- The expression (!F|(g&F)) simplifies to (T|(g&F)) which equals to T because T OR anything equals True.
- Then, (T&F) simplifies to False because True AND False equals False.

Finally, the whole expression simplifies to:

2. We can apply these rules to ((h|(F|(g&F)))&((h&(h|h))|F))|T. There are a few operations we can do first:
((h|(F|F))&((h&(h|h))|F))|T --> ((h|F)&((h&(h|h))|F))|T --> (h&((h&(h|h))|F))|T --> (h&(h|F))|T --> (h&h)|T --> h|T --> T.

3. So, the original formula simplifies to ((((z&(z|(F&T)))&T)&(z|(!T))))|(z&T)).

4. Now, we can also simplify F&T to F and hence z|(F&T) to z.

5. We also get !T to F. Therefore, the formula becomes to ((z&z&T)&(z|F))|(z&T).

6. Any variable AND-ed with itself is the variable itself, and z & T is z. Hence, the formula simplifies to z|(z&T).

(F&T)&F = F&F = F
o&F = F. This is because any term AND-ed with FALSE is always FALSE.
