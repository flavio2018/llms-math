A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, simplify (!T) and (!F).
The logic '!T' translates to false (F) and '!F' translates to true (T). Iterating through the given logic formula, replace '!T' with 'F' and '!F' with 'T'. This would simplify the equation
However, '!F' is not in the given equation, we’ll only replace '!T' with 'F'. So the formula now looks like this:

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|(F))|(F|T))))|(w&F))))&T)|w))&((w&((F|(T&T))|T))|w))&(F|T))

Next, replace 'F|T' with 'T', and 'T&T' with 'T'. Now, we have

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|((F|F)|(F|T))))|(w&F))))&T)|w))&((w&((F|T)|T))|w))&T)

which simplifies to:

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|(F|T))))|F))&T)|w))&((w&(T|T))|w))&T)

or

((w|F)&(((w|(((w|((w|T))|F))&T)|w))&((w|w))&T)

Now, simplify 'F|w' to w, '(w|w)' to w, 'F&w' to F and '(w|T)' to T. Use these to rewrite the expression as:

(w&(((w|(((w|T)|F))&T)|w)&w&T)

Finally, which simplifies to 

(w&(w&T)&w&T)

Therefore, the simplified formula is (w&w&T&T), which is equivalent to (w&T).

2. d|T always results in T because the logical OR operation with T always results in T. So, F&(d|T) becomes F.
3. F&F always results in F and !F results in T. So, (((F&(!(F&(d|T))))&F)&(!((F&(T|(T|F)))|F))) simplifies to F.
4. T|T equals T and adding F with logical OR results in T. So, !((T|T)|F) simplifies to F.

Second, anything OR False (A|F) is A. So, we can replace every 'F' when it is with '|'. 

Third, NOT False (!F) is True, and NOT True(!T) is False. 

Fourth, anything OR True (A|T) is True.

Next, any logical OR operation (|) involving True results in True. That is, anything OR True is True. We can apply this rule to simplify to:
((F&(l&F))&((u&((z&T)&z))|T&F)|u)&F).

The expression ""w|(w|w)"" means ""w or w or w"". We can simplify this to just ""w"". And ""F|w"" becomes ""False or w"" which resolves to ""w"".

The ""Not False"" or ""!F"" becomes True. And expression ""T&F"" and ""F&T"" are ""True and False"" which resolves to False (F).

Next, (F|(F&(e|T))) reduces to F, because regardless of the value of 'e', 'e|T' will be T, then F&T will be F, and so F|F is F. 

So, T|((F|(F&(e|T)))|(T&(!((!T)&(T|T))))) simplifies to T or (F or T), which is T. 

Then T&((T|((F|(F&(e|T)))|(T&(!((!T)&(T|T))))))&(!(F&F))) turns into T&T or T&!F, which simplifies to T.

Consequently, our initially complicated expression d&(T&(T&((T|((F|(F&(e|T)))|(T&(!((!T)&(T|T))))))&(!(F&F))))) simplifies to just 'd'.

Taking a look at the second part: (((e&F)&T)|F) simplifies to F since 'e' and both F and T are F.

Since F|F is F, d|(((e&F)&T)|F) changes to d|F, which is just 'd'.

2. In AND ('&') operation, any variable AND True is equal to that variable itself. So `F&T`, `T&u` and `u&T` is just `F` and `u` respectively.

(((t | ((((i & T) & ( !(((T | F) | ((T | T) & (T | F))) & F)) | (F | (T | (T & F))))) | T) | T)) | T) & ((T & (( (F | T) & T) & T)) & T))

Firstly focus on the innermost parentheses:
Since T | F = T and T | T = T, we can simplify like :
(!(((T | F) | ((T | T) & (T | F))) & F))
= (!(T & F)) // Since T or anything = T
= (!(F))      // Since F and anything = F
= T           // Since not F = T

Replacing this in the original expression we get:

(t | ((((i & T) & T)) | (F | (T | (T & F)))) | T | T) & ((T & (( (F | T) & T) & T))

Simplify innermost parenthesis again:

(T & F) = F => (t | (((i & T) & T) | (F | T) | T | T) & (T & ((T & T) & T))
= (t | i | T) & T  // Since T & anything = anything
= T & T
= T

a. `(F|T)` = T
b. `!T` = F
c. `(w|F)` = w

f. `!((f|!w))` = `!f and w`
g. `((!f and w)&F)` = F because 'And' with F results in F
h. `!F` = T

So the whole equation then simplifies to:

`(((((c&(T&F))&c)|F)|((c|(c&(c&!F)))|F))|T)` 

2. More simplification 

a. `(T&F)` = F
b. `(c&F)` = F
c. `((c&F)&c)` = F because 'And' with F results any in F
d. `(F|F)` = F

g. `(c&c)` = c
h. `(c|c)` = c
i. `(F|c)` = c

Then the equation becomes :

`(F|c|T)`

T|T = T and  
T&T = T and

3. Now substitute !T = F, and (T|False) results in T, and (T&v) = v (Because, & with T doesn't change v's value).
So, our expression becomes
((((v&v)|(!((F|F)|F))))&F)&F)&(!F)) which simplifies to
((v|!(F))&F)&(!F)
   
4. !(F) results in T, therefore,
we have 
((v|T)&F)&(!F) which simplifies to (T&F)&(!F).
   
5. (T&F) results in F, therefore, the expression becomes F&(!F)

6. Finally, (!F) results in T, so we have F&T which results in F.

Simultaneously, F | x is always equivalent to x and T | x is always equivalent to T. !F is always T and there is no way that F & F can be true.

(((h&((F&((F&(((F|(z&T)&F)&(T|(F|F|F)))&T))&F))|(T|(!((F&T)&T)))))|(h&(h|F)))|(!F)).

By applying the rules, we eliminate all instances of ""F&…"" and ""…&F"" and ""F|…"" obtaining:

(h & (T | (!(T)))) | (h & h) | T.

2. In the logic, the expression T | x is always equivalent to T:

(h & T) | (h & h) | T 

= (h | (h & h)) | T 

3. Let's use the rule that x & x is always equivalent to x, so that we'll have:

h | T 

4. Now, we have a simpler formula. But we know that T | x is always equivalent to T. Therefore, let's apply this rule to our current formula to simplify it further:

2) Also 'c&F' will always be False, 'T&k' meaning the value will be 'k' and 'T&q' will become 'q'.

3) If we look closely, we can further replace 'k or False' with 'k', 'T or s' with 'T', 's&s' with 's', 'T or False' with 'T'.

2. First, check for inner bracket results:
- F&F simplifies to F.
- T|T simplifies to T.
- T&F simplifies to F.
- (i&i) simplifies to i
- !T simplifies to F.
- z|T simplifies to T.
- i|F simplifies to i.
Now, substitute those results back into the equation: 

3. (((((i|i)&i)|(((i&(i|i))|(T&((F&(F&T)&T)|F)))&i))&T)&F)|T).

4. Again check for the results of inner brackets:
- (i|i) simplifies to i
- F&F simplifies to F
- (F&T)&T simplifies to F. 

5. Now substitute those results back into the formula:
((((i&i)|(((i&i)|(T&(F|F)))&i))&T)&F)|T)

6. And again simplify results of inner brackets.
- (i&i) simplifies to i
- T&(F|F) simplifies to F
- F & T simplifies to F

After these substitutions, the formula becomes (i|((i|F)&i))&F|T

7. And again simplify results of inner brackets
- (i|F) simplifies to i

After these substitutions, the formula becomes (i|(i&i))&F|T

8. Simplify (i&i) as i, so the formula becomes:
(i|i)&F|T

9. Additionally, (i|i) simplifies to i, so now formula is: i&F|T

10. However, any value 'AND' with False (F) results in False. So, i&F simplifies to F, and any value 'OR' with True (T) results in True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The first part of the formula that we can simplify is any (F&T) operation. Since anything AND False is False, any (F&T) becomes all F.
   
2. Similarly, anything OR True is True, so any (F|T) becomes T.

3. The NOT True (!T) is False and NOT False (!F) is True. Let's apply these rules too.

So let's start the simplification:

## Step 1:
Let's first focus on the most inner brackets (F|((m&m)|(F|T))). Here, (F|T) -> T.
So, the most inner bracket becomes (F|(m&m)|T) -> (F|T) -> T.

## Step 2:
Next is b & T and (T & (!F)), simplifying this to -> b, because anything AND True is itself and NOT False is True, so !!(((b & T) & F) is -> b & T & F) becomes b and F. 

## Step 3:
Now let's go to the outer operation (T & (!(F | T))): Here, NOT F is True and F OR T is True, so NOT True is False. Therefore the whole operation becomes T & False is F.

## Step 4:
Now the remaining operation is (!(T & (F | T))). Here, any F OR T is T, so the whole operation (!T & T) essentially becomes F, since NOT T is F.

Finally, the negation of False (!F) is True (T), and the negation of True (!T) is False (F).

And then, considering that anything OR False (a|F) is just ""a"", and anything AND False (a&F) is just F:

Becomes: 
(n&n)&(h|(F|(!F)).

Next simplification according to something OR itself (a|a) or something AND itself (a&a) is just ""a"", and the negation of False (!F) is True (T): 

Becomes:

5. F&F equals 'F', and v&v equals 'v', so (v&v)|(F&F) equals 'v', because anything or 'F' equals that something.

6. (v | v) again equals 'v', so (v|(v|v)) equals 'v'.

7. (x&T) & x equals 'x' since anything and 'T' equals that something, and anything and (that same something) equals that same something.

8. 'F' in all binary operations returns False, so ((x&T)&x)&F equals 'F'.

9. (!F) equals 'T' and anything AND True returns that something, so ((v|v)&T) equals 'v'.

10. Anything or 'F' equals that something, thus 'f' or 'F' equals 'f'; so (f|F) equals 'f'.

Further simplifications:

2. Similarly, an expression (X|T) will be 'T' (because X OR T is always true) and (X&T) will be 'X' (because when X AND T will only be true if X is true). Therefore, we can simplify '(z|T)' to 'T', '(r&T)' to 'r' and '(T&F)' to 'F'.

3. An expression like (X&F) will be 'F' (because X AND F is always false) and (X|F) will be 'X' (because X OR F will only be true if X is true). So, we can simplify '(n&F)' to 'F'.

4. '!' operator reverses the logical state of its operand. If a variable is true the logical not operator will make it false, and if it is false it will be true. Therefore, we can simplify '!(((r&r)&r)&T)' to '!r', since '(r&r)&r' simplifies to 'r' and 'r&T' simplifies to 'r'.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, remember that:
- Logical AND (denoted by &) returns True if both literals are True, else it returns False.
- Logical OR (denoted by |) returns True if either of the literals are True. It returns False if both literals are False.
- Logical NOT (denoted by !) returns True if the literal is False, and False if the literal is True.
- & has precedence before |. 

Using these rules, let's simplify:

(((((d&d)&T)|(m&(((F&F)|F)&(((s&(((s|(F&T))|(F&(n&F)))&s))&(s&((T|F)|F)))&F))))|(d&T))|(T|T)).

Start from innermost formula:
- F&T results in F and F&F results in F.
- n&F also results in F. 

So we have:
(((((d&d)&T)|(m&(((F|F)&((s&((s|(F|F))&s))&(s&(T|F))&F))))|(d&T))|(T|T)).

Continue simplifying:
- F|F results in F.
- s|(F|F) results in s.
- T|F results in T.

So we get:
(((((d&d)&T)|(m&(((F&((s&((s&s)&s))&(s&T))&F))))|(d&T))|(T|T)).

Continue simplifying:
- F&anything results in F.
- T&s results in s.
- d&d results in d.

Now we have:
(((d&T)|(m&F))|(d&T))|(T|T).

Simplify further:
- m&F results in F.
- T|T results in T.

So, we end up with:
((d&T)|F)|(d&T)|T.

One more step:
- (d&T)|F results in d&T.

And we finally get:
(d&T)|T.

The last step means, if T is true, the whole expression is true regardless the value of d. So the formula simplifies to:

- c | F simplifies to c, since False doesn't affect the disjunction operation.

Our formula becomes:
(c | (c & (F | (q & ((q | q) | q)) | q)) | (c & c)) & !T.

Next, simplify the formulas containing the same literals:
- c & c simplifies to c.
- (q | q) simplifies to q, since q or q is just q.

Our formula becomes:
(c | (c & (F | q | q)) & !T.

Again, F or q is just q, since False doesn't change the truth value of the disjunction.

Our formula becomes:
(c | (c & q)) & !T.

Next,
- (c | (c & q)) would simplify to just c, since c, inclusive or with c and q is still just c (as per absorption law).

Our formula becomes:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we will simplify the given logic formula:


Logical OR (represented by |) between same literals (like a|a) equals the literal (like a). So, (f|f) simplifies to f.

Logical AND (represented by &) of a literal with True (like a&T) equals the literal itself (like a). So, ((f&T)|F)&T simplifies to (f|F)&T, which simplifies to T&T, and finally to T.

Logical OR between any literal and True or between True and any literal is always True. So, the statements (T|T), (F|T), and (T|T&T) simplify to T.

Logical AND of any expression with False is always False. Hence, as an intermediate result, we have f&(f|(!p&T))&T, where the expressions in brackets are True or False.

A literal OR False results in the literal itself. Hence, the expression simplifies to f&(f|(!p))&T, because T&any literal returns the literal itself.


Logical NOT (represented by !) of True (T) is False (F) and vice versa. Hence, (!T) equals F.

Therefore, the whole Expression (((((f&(f|(!p)))&T)&(F|T))|F)&((!T)|T)) simplifies to (f&(f|(!p)))&(T)&(F|T). 

And that expression further simplifies to ((f&f)|(!p))&T. 

The AND operation between similar literals returns the literal itself, so (f&f) is equal to f. Therefore, the expression simplifies to (f|(!p))&T.

Since AND operation between a literal and T returns the literal itself, the expression simplifies to (f|(!p)), i.e., either f is True or p is not True.",(f|(!p)),f

A: Let's think step-by-step.","We can start by evaluating the most basic expressions.

Since T represents the True and F represents the False, we have:

T|F = True (because OR means if one of them is True, the outcome is True)
F&F = False (because AND means both of them have to be True, for the outcome to be True)
F&T = False (because AND means both of them have to be True, for the outcome to be True)
T&F = False (because AND means both of them have to be True, for the outcome to be True)
T&True = True (because AND means both of them have to be True, for the outcome to be True)

Next, let's proceed with the simplified expressions:
(((T|((F|F)&(F&T))))&F) simplifies to (T&F) which is False.
T|(T|False) simplifies to True.
This gives us (!(((T|False)&False)&(a|(False|(T|(!((e&e)|T)))))) which simplifies to (!((((True)&False)&(a|(False|(T|False))))) which simplifies to (!(False&a)).

Finally lets think about this part: (T&F)|T simplifies to False|T which equals to True. So we have the !True which equals False. 

So, putting it all together we have the simplified expression as False | (!(False & a)), which simplifies to False | !False | a or, finally, True | a. Since True OR anything is always True, the final simplified formula is T.",T,F

(T|T) becomes T because True OR True is always True.

(!(T|(T&T))) becomes F as (!True) always gives False, and (T|(T&T)) results in True.

(T&T) becomes T.

Now, the operation (&) between T and F always gives F. That means if we encounter any (T&F) or (F&T), we can simplify it to F.

(F&T) will always be False (as we're doing an 'and' operation with False).

Now, (F&(T|False)) will be False (as we're doing an 'and' operation with False).
So, (f|(F&(T|False))) just becomes 'f'.

Then, (!((f|(F&(T|((x|x)&(F&T)))))&(T&(!(F|(T|T)))))) can be simplified to !(f&T). 

After that, ((T&(!(F|(T|T))))&F) will always be False (as we're doing an 'and' operation with False).
So, ((T&(!(f&T)))&F) will be False.

Next, (((h|F)&h)&T) simplifies to h (since 'h' AND True is 'h').

2. Logical not (!) for T (True) is F (False) and for F is T. Hence, !T = F and !F = T. 
3. Logical and (&) with F and T is always F, because a false statement makes everything false in 'and' operation. Hence, (T&F) = F.
4. Logical and (&) with two exact same variables like (T&T) returns the same variable itself. Hence, (T&T) = T.
5. Logical or (|) with a variable and T (True) is always T, because a true component makes the result true in 'or' operation. Hence, (V|T) = T. 
6. Logical and (&) with a variable and F (False) is always F, because a false component makes the result false in 'and' operation. Hence, (V&F) = F.

f|T (due to step 1)

This after simplification from step 2 is !T which is equal to F

4. Then we simplify b|(b&b):

5. So we simplify (((b|(b&b))|T)|T)=> ((b|T)|T).

Now, to simplify the given formula:

   1) Inside the most inner formula are F&W&F. This becomes F as any value AND False returns False.

   2) False OR anything will return anything.

   3) F | T will always return T.

   Now, (((a & T) & T) & ((a & a) & T) &(a & a)) = a & a & a = a

   (s & ((s & T) | T | (!T))) = (s & T)

   4) Now let's look at T &(F & T). According to our rules, anything AND False returns False. So T & F = F.

   Next, there's negation !F, which turns False into True.
   
   The second part of the equation becomes (T & F).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the constants: 
- !F becomes T.
- F|T becomes T.
- T&F becomes F.
- F&F becomes F.
- F&T becomes F.
- !T becomes F.
- Any statement &F becomes F.
- Any statement |F remains same with the statement.
- Any statement &T remains same with the statement.
- Any statement |T becomes T.
- !(F&any statement) becomes T.
- !(F|any statement) becomes !any statement.

We can apply these rules to simplify the expression gradually.

Initial expression is: 
((!F)&((T&(F|(T|(T&((!(F&(k&((F&F)&T))))&((!(F|(!(m&F))))|T))))))|(F&(F&((e|(!T))&F))))).

After applying the above rules, we have:

(T&(T|T)) simplifies to (T&T), and then to T.

2. !(F|((t&t)&F)) simplifies to !(F|F) and that equals to T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. The expression F|X (false OR X) simplifies just to X. Using this rule, and the fact that F|T is just T, we can simplify the formula from

2. The expression X&T (X AND true) simplifies just to X. Plus, the expression X&F simplifies to F (false). Using this rules, you get
(s|((!(T|(!(F&((z&z)&T)|T))))&((p&((j&j)|T))|T)).

3. The expression (!T) is just F (false), and (!F) is T (true). Using this rule, we have
(s|((!F)&((p&j)|T)).

4. The expression X&(!F) simplifies to X (because X AND true is just X), giving
(s|((p&j)|T)).

5. The expression X|T (X OR true) simplifies just to T, so the final simplified logic formula is

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We reduce the negations using De Morgan's rules – !(!p) = p; and !(!(!p)) = !p, where p is an arbitrary propositional variable. 

   Thus the first part of inner clause – (()&(!(!((v|(!(y&(!(!F)))))&(!((F&(T&(F&T)))&F))))) becomes – (()&((v|(!(y&F)))&T)).

2. F&F = F, F&T = F, and F&p = F, where p is any propositional variable and T represents True value.

   Thus the first part becomes – (()&(v|(!y))).

3. The second part of our expression is – ((!((!(T|F))|T))&T)&T.

   ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q and ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q; where p and q are propositional variables.

   Thus the second part – ((!((!(T|F))|T))&T)&T becomes – (F|F)&T or F&T, which equals to F.

- Any value and with True (T) results in the value itself, such as v & T = v.
- Not False (F) is True (T), so !F = T.
- True or with anything is always True, so T | v = T.

In the other part of expression as we know, True AND something gives you something. But here we have something AND False, which is already False.

- (!T) will always be False, because it is the negation of True.
- (F|T) will always be True.
- (!((F&F)&(F|T))) will always be True, because it is the negation of (F&True), and F&True is always False.
- (F|((((o|o)|o)&F) will always be False, because it is F OR (some expression AND F), and any expression AND F is always False.
- (F&False), will always be False.
- (T & False) will always be False.

Substituting these results back into the expression, we get:

((y|(T&False))|((False)&F))

This can further be simplified, considering that (T&False) and (False&F) are both False and True OR False is equal to True:
(y|False)|False
y|False

So irrespective of the initial values of y, the given logical formula simplifies down to y.",y,y
