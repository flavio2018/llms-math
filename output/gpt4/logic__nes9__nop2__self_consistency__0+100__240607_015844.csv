A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we know that a logical AND (notated as ""&"") operation with True and True (T&T), or NOT False (!F), or True with any other variable (T&F, T&m), results in that variable itself (for example, T&F is F, T&m is m). Similarly, a logical OR operation (notated as ""|"") with False or any variable (example, F|m, F&F) results in the variable itself (F&m is m).

Therefore, we can simplify all statements like T&Smth (which will be equal to Smth), F|Smth (which will be equal to Smth) as well as F&F (which is equal to False), T&T and !F which are equal to T, and F&T which is always equal to F.

So the simplified version of the formula is:

( T & (T & (m & F)) | F ) & F.

The next step is to use the fact that any variable AND'd with False equals False:

= ( T & False | F ) & F 
= ( False | F ) & F
= F & F.

5. Now plug these simplified parts back into the original expression and we get ((F)&((((m)&T)&(F))&(F))) which simplifies to (F&m&F&F) = (F)  (since F and anything gives False)

Every logical and where one value is False, will always be False.

So, let's simplify the formula,

Again, we have k&(T&F). Since T&F equals to F, so k&F is F. Hence, the formula becomes ((!((i|T)|T))&(((((F)|T)|F)&F)|F)).

Simplified further, it becomes ((!((i|T)|T))&(((T|F)&F)|F)).

Again simplified, it becomes ((!((i|T)|T))&((T&F)|F)), which simplifies to ((!((i|T)|T))&((F)|F)).

Then, simplify it further:

- T | F = T

After these simplifications, we get:

Finally, !F equals to T, so the final simplification will be:

So, we have F|(False) which is False.

(j&j)=j because ""j and j"" is always the truth value of ""j"" as it is the same term.

(j|j)=j because ""j or j"" is always the truth value of ""j"" as it is the same term.

Similarly, any repetition of ""j"" in the expression matched with ""&"" or ""|"" can be simplified to a single ""j"", since ANDing or ORing a term with itself has no effect.

r | r & True | !(l & (False & False) & True)

- Any literal ANDed with True or ORed with False remains unchanged. 
- Any literal ANDed with False or ORed with True changes to False or True respectively.

Let's apply these rules to simplify the logic formula:

((F&(F|(((F&T)&(F&F))&(!T))))|(!(g|(p|T))))

This simplifies completely to:

((F&F|F)&!F|(!g|!T)))

Further simplification will lead to:

(F&!F|!g)

Then:

(!g)

The second part (F|(F|(p&F))) simplifies to F, as logical AND of any literal with False results in False. So, whatever the value of 'p' is, (p&F) will result in F then F|F will always be F.

So, the entire logic formula simplifies to:

!g & F

As per logical AND operation rules, any literal ANDed with False will result in False. Therefore, the final simplified logic formula is:

2) p OR p AND p is equivalent to just p, so the formula simplifies to: (p&T&(e&F)|F|F)&T&(T|(t|t)&F).

3) The expression (t|t)&F will always be False since anything AND with False is False. And also, because anything OR with False is itself, so the formula becomes: (p&T&(e&F)|F|F)&T&T&F.

(((T&F)&T)|F) simplifies to (F&T)|F which simplifies again to F|F which is F.

((F|(T&T))|F) simplifies to (F|T)|F which simplifies again to T|F which is T.

   So the whole expression within the inner parentheses becomes !(l|F), and this simplifies to !l because anything OR F equals the original value.

(((((((v|v)&T)&(!(((F|T)&(!F))|(T&T))))|T)|F)&T)|((((u|F)&F)|T)&F)).

Substituting the recently found values into the formula gives:
((((((v&True)&(!((True&True) or True))) or True) or False)&True) or ((True&False) or True)&False)
- Anything AND True is always equal to itself, so v&True simplifies to v and True&True simplifies to True.
- !((True & True) or True) will simplify to False because any True OR True simplifies to True which when AND with False gives False.
- Any True OR False simplifies to True. 

This leaves us with:
((((v&False) | True) or False)&True or ((True & False) or True)&False)
- Any v & False simplifies to False, ((True & False) or True) simplifies to True.
- So the updated formula is: ((False or True) or False) & True or (True & False).
- Any False OR True simplifies to True, and any True AND False simplifies to False.

2. We can take the w&w out and use just w, as well as w|F as simply w again:

   (((k&T)&k)&(k&(((w&((w&T)))|F)|!T)).

3. w&T reduces to just w, as ""w and T"" is equivalent to just ""w"". Also, note that !T is just F:

   (((k&T)&k)&(k&((w|F)|F)).

4. w|F condenses to w, since ""w or F"" is just ""w"". Then we are left with:

   (((k&T)&k)&(k&w)).

5. k&T reduces to simply k, meaning we can simplify it to:

   ((k&k)&(k&w)).

6. k&k is simply k, and so, our most simplified answer is:

   k&(k&w).

In some cases where the simplification allows, this could further be reduced to k&w. However, given that k is also dependent on itself as evident from the original logical formula, k&(k&w) would be a more accurate simplification.",k&(k&w),k

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Any value OR False (symbolized as v | F) is equivalent to the value itself (v). Also, any value OR True (symbolized as v | T) is always True (T). This means that, in the entire expression, we can replace (w|F) by w, and (((n|F))|F) by F.
2) Any value AND True (symbolized as v & T) is equivalent to the value itself (v). So, in the expression ((((m|m)&T)&T)&F), we can simplify (m|m)&T first to m&T, then to m.
2) Any value AND False (symbolized as v & F) is always False (F). So, from point 2, the expression (((m|m)&T)&T)&F is simplified to m & F, then to F.
3) From point 1 and point 2, the original expression simplifies to ((n|F)&(n|(!((T&T)|T)|F)))|T. We can simplify !((T&T)|T) to !(T | T), then to !T, and finally to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Any expression compared to FALSE with logical and (&), always resolves to FALSE. So:
   - F & T is equal to False 

2. Similarly, any expression compared to TRUE with logical or (|), always resolves to TRUE:
   - F | T is equal to True
   - (h | T) is equal to True
   - (g & F) is always False, because g is compared with False using logical and, any value with False using and is False, so replacing (g & F) with False in (h|(F|(g&F))) we get (h | F | False) which simplifies to (h | False) and further simplifies to h.
 
3. Any expression compared with itself using logical or (|), is equivalent to the expression:
   - h | h is equal to h

4. Logical not (!) of true (T) is false (F) and vice versa. 

5. Any expression compared with True using logical and (&), is equivalent to the expression itself:
   - z & T is equal to z
   - z & (z | False) equals to z & z which is same as z

So, considering the above points, let's simplify the original logic formula.

- (((z&(z|(F&T)))&T)&(z|(!(((h|(F|(g&F)))&((h&(h|h))|F))|T))))|(z&T)
- simplifies to (((z&(z|False)) & T) & (z|(!(h|(h|False) | T)))) | (z & T)

- simplifies to (z & (z | (!h | T))) | z

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Before starting calculations, let's remind the laws of Boolean algebra
   - (1) Law of Identity : p = p
   - (2) Domination Law : p AND False = False, p OR True= True
   - (3) Idempotent Law : p AND p = p, p OR p = p
   - (4) Double Negation Law : NOT(NOT (p)) = p
   - (5) Commutative Law : p AND q = q AND p, p OR q = q OR p
   - (6) Associative Law : (p AND q) AND r = p AND (q AND r), (p OR q) OR r = p OR (q OR r)
   - (7) Distributive Law : p AND (q OR r )= (p AND q) OR (p AND r), p OR (q AND r) = (p OR q) AND (p OR r)
   - (8) De Morgan’s Law : NOT (p AND q) = NOT(p) OR NOT(q), NOT (p OR q) = NOT(p) AND NOT(q)
   - (9) Absorption Law : p OR (p AND q) = p, p AND (p OR q) = p
   - (10) Negation Law : p AND NOT(p) = False, (p OR NOT(p) = True)

2. Use the Domination Law: (v|F) = v and (F&F) = F, T&F = F
   The new formula: ((v|v)&(h&((((T&F))|F)|(!((f&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)

3. Use the Idempotent Law: (v|v) = v 
   The new formula: (v&(h&((((T&F))|F)|(!((f&T)&F)))|(!T)))|T)

4. Use the Double Negation Law: (!T) = F
   The new formula: (v&(h&((((T&F))|F)|((f&T)&F)|F)))|T)

5. Using Domination Law: T&F=F, F|F=F, F&F=F; 
   The new formula: (v&(h&F))|T)

6. Use Domination Law again: h&F = F;
   The new formula: (v&F)|T)

7. Use Domination Law once more: v&F = F;
   The new formula: F|T

8. Finally, applying the Domination Law again, we find that F|T = T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. True & anything = anything. False & anything = False. True | anything = True. False | anything = anything.

2. (T&q) simplifies to q, as True and q will always result to the value of q. (w&F) simplifies to F as False and anything will always be False. So the expression then becomes (((w|q|T)&F)|(F|F|T|F)).

3. In OR operations, True or anything will always be True. This causes the expression to simplify drastically to just T: (F|T).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. According to the semantics, A & A simplifies to A. So, our formula becomes:
(T&(T|((F&(!(F|((j&F)&F))))&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T))))).

2. T&T simplifies to T. So the formula becomes:
(T|((F&(!(F|((j&F)&F))))&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T)))).

3. (j&F)&F simplifies to F since j&F is either True or False, but in both cases result of the operation AND with False gives False. So, we get:
(T|((F&(!(F|F)))&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T)))).

4. F|F simplifies to F. So we obtain:
(T|((F&(!F))&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T)))).

5. !F simplifies to T since the logical NOT of False is True. Thus, the formula now is:
(T|((F&T)&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T)))).

6. F&T simplifies to F, because AND of False and any value gives False. Hence, our formula becomes:
(T|((F)&(g|((((a|(w|T))|F)&F)|T)))).

7. (w|T) simplifies to T because OR of any value with True is always True. Therefore, the formula is:
(T|((F)&(g|((((a|T)|F)&F)|T)))).

8. (a|T) simplifies to T, for the same reason as above. So, the formula is now:
(T|((F)&(g|(((T|F)&F)|T)))).

9. T|F simplifies to T. Hence, we have:
(T|((F)&(g|((T&F)|T)))).

10. T&F simplifies to F because AND of True and False is False. Therefore, formula now has a shape: 
(T|((F)&(g|(F|T)))).

11. F|T simplifies to T. Thus, we get:

12. g|T simplifies to T. Formula becomes:
