A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, any proposition ""P"" AND with False will always be False. This is because, for logical 'AND' operation, both the operands must be True for the result to be True. If any one of them is False, then the outcome will be False.

Therefore, (p&p)&F simplifies to F and F&(u|T) simplifies to F.

Also, any proposition ""P"" OR with True will always be True. This is because, for logical 'OR' operation, as long as any one of the proposition is True, the result will be True. 

So, u|T simplifies to T.

But considering the previous simplification F&(u|T) simplifies to F, it does not matter what value 'u' is since F&T simplified to F. Hence F&(u|T) OR (p&p)&F simplifies to F.

Therefore, the original statement simplifies to:

(t|t)|F, which further simplifies to t|F based on the Idempotent law (P | P = P) where t was repeated in an 'OR' operation.

Finally, any proposition ""P"" OR with False will always be 'P'. This is because, for logical 'OR' operation, if any one of the propositions is True, the outcome will be True. Hence, any proposition ""P"" OR with False will be 'P' itself.

As a result, t|F simplifies to t.

Next, the expressions ""T&T"" and ""F&T"" are respectively equivalent to True and False as any expression AND True is simply the original expression whereas any expression AND False is False. 

Knowing these facts, we can simplify the given expression to:

The ""z&True"" simplifies to just ""z"". 

Thus the expression is: z|(F&(False)) 

The ""F&False"" simplifies to ""False"".
