A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's handle the MAX operations:
The MAX operation returns the maximum value of its arguments. So assuming the operation goes from left to right:

- For MAX 4 [MAX 6 0 3] [MAX 7 4 3], the first embedded MAX gives max(6, 0, 3) = 6 and the second gives max(7, 4, 3) = 7. Thus, this simplifies to MAX 4 6 7, which is 7, as 7 is the maximum value.
- For MAX 8 5 2, this gives 8, as 8 is the max value.

Then, we handle the MIN operation:

- For MIN 5 9 6, this gives 5, as 5 is the minimum value.

So now our expression simplifies to: 
[SM 7 1 [SM 8 0 5]]

Let's handle the SM operations:

- For SM 7 1, we sum the numbers and take the result modulo 10. Hence, (7+1) MOD 10 = 8.
- For SM 8 0 5, we do the same and calculate (8+0+5) MOD 10 = 3.

So our final expression now simplifies to:
[SM 8 3]

And by applying the SM operation to this, we find that (8+3) MOD 10 equals 1, which is the final result.

Again, calculate ""SM"" operation for 1 0 7:

SM 1 0 7 = (1+0+7)%10 = 8%10 = 8.

The maximum value out of 9, 5 and 2 is 9.

Next, [SM 2 6 6] gives us the sum of 2, 6 and 6, which is 14. Since SM means sum modulo 10, we want the remainder when 14 is divided by 10, so the result is 4.

Now, [MIN 1 9 4].
The minimum value out of 1, 9 and 4 is 1.

Onto the next bracket, we see [SM 6 3 5]. This gives us the sum of 6, 3 and 5, which is 14. But since we're dealing with sum modulo 10, this gives us a result of 4.

- [SM 6 3 9] is (6+3+9) modulo 10 = 18 modulo 10 = 8.

So, the first part [MAX 8 [SM 4 [MIN 1 5 8] [SM 6 3 9]]] becomes [MAX 8 [SM 4 1 8]].

Continue to solve:

- [SM 4 1 8] is (4+1+8) modulo 10 = 13 modulo 10 = 3.

So, the first part becomes [MAX 8 3] which is 8.

- [MIN 1 2 7] is 1.
- [SM 7 5 2] is (7+5+2) modulo 10 = 14 modulo 10 = 4.
