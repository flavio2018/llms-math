A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve inside the parentheses: 53 + 91 gives us 144. At the same time, -80 - 7 gives -87. Then, -89 - 79 results in -168, and 17 + 69 is 86. 

Using modulo arithmetic, we compute the modulo 100 if the result is positive, and the modulo -100 if it's negative. Thus, 144 modulo 100 = 44, -87 modulo -100 = -87, -168 modulo -100 = -68, and 86 modulo 100 = 86. 

The expression then becomes: ((44 - -87) - (-68 - 86)).

Solving these parentheses gives: 44 - -87 is 131, and -68 - 86 is -154. Now taking modulo of these, 131 modulo 100 = 31, and -154 modulo -100 = -54.

Now, the expression becomes (31 - -54), which results in 85. Since 85 is positive, we take modulo 100, which results 85.

Now let's substitute the results back in the first expression:
(-40) * (-54) = 2160

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, compute the operations within the parentheses:

18 - 44 = -26 (because number is negative, take modulo -100) => -26 mod -100 = -26.

96 - 38 = 58 (because number is positive, take modulo 100) => 58 mod 100 = 58.

- 75 + -4 equals 71. Calculating modulo 100 of 71 is 71.
- Therefore, (-45+69) - (75+-4) equals 24-71, which is -47. Calculating modulo -100 of -47 is -47.
- 51 - 24 equals 27. Calculating modulo 100 of 27 is 27.
- -41 + -59 equals -100. Calculating modulo -100 of -100 is 0.
- Therefore, ((51-24) + (-41+-59)) equals 27 + 0, which is 27. Calculating modulo 100 of 27 is 27.

Now, let's put it all together:
- (-47 + 27) equals -20. The modulo -100 of -20 is -20.

68+95 is 163, 163 mod 100 is 63.
26-43 is -17, -17 mod -100 is -17.

-8 - 83 = -91.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, calculate the terms within the inner parentheses. The modulo 100 of -21*29 is -9 (since -21*29 = -609 -> -609 mod 100 = -9). Then, 91-51 = 40.

That gives us ((-9*40) + ((-84*58)*(-25*21)). 

Again, calculate -9*40 = -360 and since it's negative, the modulo -100 is -60. 

Then calculate the following term, the modulo 100 of -84*58 is -12 (since -84*58 = -4872 -> -4872 mod 100 = -72). Next, the modulo 100 of -25*21 is 25 (since -25*21 = -525 -> -525 mod 100 = -25. In modulo arithmetic, -25 can be expressed as 100-25 = 75, which is 25 when modulo 100). 

Therefore, we now have (-60 + (-12*25)).

Moving on, calculate -12*25 = -300 and the modulo -100 is -0. 

So we have -60 + 0 = -60. 

Since our original problem requires taking the modulo 100 of the final outcome, and -60 is negative, we will use the modulo -100 which gives an answer of -60.",-60,-60

59 * -32 = -1888. Modulo -100 gives -88.

The last operation gives us:
28 - (-88) = 116

The final result, after applying the modulo 100 operation, is 16.",16,16
