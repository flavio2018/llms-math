2. Likewise, T AND F is always False (since both need to be true for a logical AND to be true). And the NOT operator will flip that to True. So, !(T&F) turns into !F which will be True.

Then, consider the expression ""(v&T)&F"". The ""v&T"" can be either ""True"" or ""False"", but ""AND"" operation with ""False"" always implies ""False"". Therefore, this simplifies to ""F"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the innermost expressions:
T | T equals to T (or operation with both True results in True).
T & T equals to T (and operation with both True results in True).
F & T equals to F (and operation with True and False results in False).

Now, simplify the simplified formula:
T | F equals to T (or operation with at least one True results in True).
F & F equals to F (and operation with at least one False results in False).

The next simplification is based on the logical identities:
x & T equals to x (something logically and-ed with True remains the same).
x | F equals to x (something logically or-ed with False remains the same).

So our expression gets down to the very simple form:

- X & T = X, for any X, so (q & T) = q.
- X & F = F, for any X. Hence, (F & F) = F.

Additionally, anything or'd with True (X|T) will always be True, as True is the absorbing element for logical OR.

Applying these principles, we can simplify:

- ((o|F)|o) becomes (o|o) and further simplifies to o.
- (F|((T|T)|(F|T))) becomes (F|(T|T)) and further simplifies to T, since X|T is always T.

The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
(((l&(T|(F&F)))|l)|(F&(!((d&F)&F)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, inside the brackets logical and with False (denoted as F&F) will be False.
So the formula will become: (((l&(T|F)))|l)|(F&(!(d&F))).

Now, logical OR with False means the other value will be dominant. So, T|F equals to True.
Hence, the formula will be: (((l&T))|l)|(F&(!(d&F))), which simplifies to: ((l|l)|(F&(!(d&F))).

Next, any value OR itself just equals itself. So, l|l equals to l.
The formula simplifies to: (l|(F&(!(d&F))).

We see that there is ""d&F"", where logical and with False means False. So, this turns to: (l|(F&(!F))), which further simplifies to: (l|F).

Again, any value OR False is just equals the value itself. So, l|F equals to l.
Hence, the final simplified formula is: l.",l,l

((T&(T&(o&(T&F))))|(k&((T&(F&F))|F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","In the first cluster within the overall brackets, we have:

T &(T & (o & (T & F)))

We know that T & F results in F, so that reduces to:

T & (T & (o & F))

Which further reduces to:

T & (T & F)

Because anything 'and' False is also False, we can further simplify this to:

T & F 

And that will just results in F. Now, let's look at the other cluster:

k & ((T & (F & F)) | F))

Here we have F & F, which is just F. So we can simplify to:

k & ((T & F) | F)) 

Then, T & F results to F, next is:

k & (F | F)

Which further reduces to:

k & F

Finally, k & F is just F. 

So overall, with the two clusters simplified to F, the original expression can be simplified to:

F | F 

Final answer is F.",F,F
97,logic,self_consistency,((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))),"Q: Simplify the following logic formula, where the symbols &, | and ! have the semantics of logical and, logical or and logical not, respectively. The values T and F represent the True and False values, respectively. All other literal values can be either True or False.
((f|(F&((a&F)&F)))|(f|((F|(h&F))&T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First we consider the sub-expressions that have F (False) value:
(a&F) is always F, same as (h&F). 
F&F is also F, and all F inside parenthesis ((F&F)) or combined with any other values by & (like F&((a&F)&F)) will be F. 

Also, F combined with any other values by | (like F|(h&F)) will not change the result, so we can ignore them.

So, the expression simplifies as:

((f|F)|(f|F)) 

Using the rule that anything OR'd with False (F) remains the same, the expression further simplifies to:

(f | f)

Finally, since any expression OR'd with itself yields itself, the expression simplifies to:

(((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b)&(!(!T))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. !(!T) would simplify to T because two negations cancel out. 
2. (F|(F|F)) would simplify to F, since False or False or False is equal to False.
3. Since ""b"" AND ""T"" (b&T) would simplify to ""b"", as anything and True is just that thing itself. Similarly, ""b"" OR ""b"" simplifies to ""b"". 
4. Hence ((((b&T)|b)|(F|(F|F)))|b) , simplifies to ""b"" because ""b"" or False or ""b"" is equal to ""b"". 
5. Hence, the simplified expression would be ((""b"")&(T)), this can be simplified further to just ""b"", because anything and True is just that thing itself.
Ans: b.",b,b

((F|F)|((((!T)&(F|F))|T)|((F|T)&F))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify F | F and !T, which return F and F, respectively.

Then, replacing these, the formula becomes: ((F)|( (((F)&(F)) |T) |((F)&F))) 

Next, simplify F & F, ((F)&(F)), and F & F,((F)&F), both return F as well.

So it further simplifies to: ((F)|( (F |T) |F))

Next, F | T returns T. 

Replace this, and the formula simplifies to: ((F)|( T |F)).

Next, T | F also returns T. 

Replace this, and the formula simplifies to: (F | T).

Finally F | T simplifies to T.

So the whole given logic formula simplifies to T (or True).",T,T
