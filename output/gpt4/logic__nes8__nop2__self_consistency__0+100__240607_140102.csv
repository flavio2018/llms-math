A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. A truth value ""T"" or a logical formula with multiple expressions will result in simplification to ""T"". Therefore, (k|T) simplifies to T and (F|(k|T)) simplifies to T.

2. Similarly, (m|F) equals m, because the logical OR operation of any expression with False equals that expression. So, (m&m) simplifies to m and ((m&m)|(m|F)) simplifies to m.

3. Given that, a logical AND operation with True does not change the original expression. Therefore, combining the results above (T&m&T) simplifies to m.

4. Combining with x, we get (x&m).

5. For the second part of the expression, the logical AND operation of any expression with False yields False. Given (F&(l|T)), the result is F. Furthermore, F in OR operation with False equals False.

Then, considering that ""anything OR True"" is always True, we get 
""!(k|T)"" == ""!(T)"" which simplifies to F (since NOT True = False).

Now, for simplifying the ""!(T|(!(!F)))"" part, let's look at ""!F"" first.

Since NOT False = True, ""!(!F)"" simplifies to T.

The ""!(T|(!(!F)))"" expression thus, can ultimately be simplified as ""!T"", which translates as F (because NOT True = False).

So, we get: `y&(((y|((y|F)|((y|y)|((y&T)&(F|T)))))|(!(!F)))|F))`.

`F&T` will always be False. Hence `(y|F)` simplifies to `y`.

So, the above expression becomes `y&(((y|(y|((y|y)|(y&F))))|(!(!F)))|F))`.

`y|y` is `y` as any variable OR'd with itself is itself. Also, `(y|F)` is `y`. The `y&F` will always be False. 

Hence, the above expression becomes `y&((y|False)|(!(!F))|F)`.

`!F` evaluates to True, so `!(!F)` will result in False. You have `False` OR `False`, which is `False`.

Also, `y` OR `False` simplifies down to `y`.

Hence, the above expression simplifies to `y&(y|F)`.

`y` OR `F` results in `y`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, the operation ((T|F)|(T|F)) can be simplified as True, because T|F = True. So, we are left with (!(T|T)). That equals to False, as T|T = True and using not operation it becomes False.

2. The next operation is (m|m), which equals to ""m"", as any logic value or with itself is itself.

3. Now look at (((m|m)|((T|F)|(T|F)))|F). This is equivalent to (m|True)|F. The ""|"" operation with True results in True, therefore the whole expression can be reduced to True.

4. Finally, we are left with ((y&T)|F)|(F|((!T)&True)), which is equal to (y&True)|F)|F. y&True equals to ""y"", as any logical value and with True is itself.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, within the inner braces, s&s equals s and s|s equals s. Both lead to s.

2. Anything &T means that element itself because anything ""and"" True is that thing itself. Hence (((s&s)|s)&T)|s)) simplifies to s|s, which is equal to s.

3. Any statement |T is True. Hence, (s|T) simplifies to True. So, the whole expression simplifies to ((True&s)|True)&((((z|(((c|T)&(!F))&T))|T)&F)&T).

4. !F equals True because ""not False"" is True. Therefore, ((c|T)&(!F))&T simplifies to ((c|T)&True)&T which further simplifies to True&T, which equals to True.

5. Now, our equation becomes ((True&s)|True)&((((z|True)|T)&F)&T), which simplifies to True&((((z|True)|T)&F)&T).

6. z|True results in True, hence the equation can now be simplified to True & (((True|T)&F)&T), which equals to True & (True&F), that gives us True&False, hence ultimately the answer is False.

Thus, the formula becomes ((i&(i&(!((d&F)&(!T)))))|F).

Seeing again that any statement ""& F"" is always False, we can simplify (d&F) to F.

So, the formula now looks like this: ((i&(i&(!((F)&(!T))))))|F).

Next, (!((F)&(!T)))) after simplification means that a False and True statement is False applying the not operation turns it into True.

((i&(i&True))|F) after simplying means i & i which simply becomes i because any statement ""a & a"" is always a.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. First, we simplify (T|F). Logical ""or"" (|) returns True if at least one of the operands is True. So, (T|F) is T.

2. Your expression becomes ((((!l|T))&T)|F)&F)|((!((((o&o)&(o&T))|o)|T))&F).

3. After that: !l | T becomes T because logical ""or"" (|) returns True if at least one of the operands is True. !T turns into F. Therefore, this part of the statement (((!l|T))&T) equals T & T, which equals T.

4. Thus the expression turns into (T|F)&F|((!((((o&o)&(o&T))|o)|T))&F)

5. T|F simplifies to T, because logical ""or"" (|) returns True if at least one of the operands is True. T & F turns into F (logical ""and"" (&) only returns True if both operands are True).

6. Hence, our formula is F|((!((((o&o)&(o&T))|o)|T))&F).

- o&F = F, because the ""and"" operation is true only if and only both values are true. In this case, one is false, so the result is false.
- !F = T, because the ""not"" operation inverts the value.

Our expression will now look like this:

Now, let's further simplify the expressions:
- !F|T = T, because the ""or"" operation is true if at least one value is true.
- T|(!(!(!T))) = T, because the ""or"" operation is true if at least one value is true. Also, (!(!(!T))) simplifies to T. 

Our expression is now:
(i&i)|(((x&T)&T)|T)

Further simplifications are as follows:
- x&T = x, because considering ""and"" operation with ""true"" doesn't change the other operand. 
- (x&T)&T = x, for the same reason.

Which means that the expression turns into:
(i&i)|(x|T)

At this point:
- x|T = T, because the ""or"" operation is true if at least one of the values is true.

So, the final simplified expression will be:
(i&i)|T 

This can yet be simplified as:
- (i&i) = i, because truth value of an operand with ""and"" operation to itself doesn't change.

!F = T, so again we have F|(T&T) = T. And again, (T & T) = T, so ((o&F)&T)&(z|(!F)))|T)&(F|(T&T)) = T.

The statement thus we can simplify like `(((g&((F|F)&F))|(!(F&T)))|F)|(F&(p|(v|T)))` can be further simplified to `(((g&(F&F))|(!F))|F)|(F&(p|T))`.

`F&F` is `F`.

Then we look at the sub-expression (T|(T&(!T))). The sub-expression (T&(!T)) equals to False, since one of the operands is always False. Therefore, the expression T|(T&(!T)) equals to T|F, which is always True.

The subexpression (F|(s|T)) equals to F|T, which is always True. Thus, (T|(F|(s|T))) equals to T|True, which is always True.

Last, we know that for any expression x, the expression (x&F) is always False. Therefore, whatever the value of p is, the expression (p&(((T|(T&(!T)))&(T|(F|(s|T))))&F) is always False.

Finally, let's substitute all the simplifications in the original formula. We have:

6. The inner `(k & F)` simplifies to `F`.
7. Next, our statement becomes `(F & (F & T) | ((T & (T | F)) | T | T)) & (!(F | F)) & (n & F)`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The logical formula you've given can be divided into different steps. Let's take it step by step.

1. T | anything = T. So, T | ((i|(m|T))|T) is just T. 
2. Something AND F always results in F. So, T & F = F. 

Thus, (f | ((T|((i|(m|T))|T)) & F)) becomes (f | F), which simplifies to f, because anything OR False is just that thing itself.

Now, let's look at the next part.

1. f & T = f, because anything AND True is just that thing itself. 
2. So, (f & (f & T)) or F becomes (f & f), or F which simplifies to f or F, and that simplifies to f, because anything OR False is that thing itself.

Summing it all up, the given sentence (f | ((T | ((i | (m | T)) | T)) & F)) | (f | (f & ((f & (f & T)) | F) & f))) | (T | T), simplifies to just f | f , which further simplifies to just f.",f,T

3. Any literal ""and"" with False is False, so the entire interior part of the parenthesis after each F will be False. So, replace ((F&F)&F) with F and (i&F) with F, we get

4. A ""or"" B is True at least one of A and B is True, so replace F or T and F inside parenthesis with T, we get (!((r|T|T)&F))

((l&(l&(!F)))&((l&((r|(!(l&(F&F))))|(!((T|(T|T))&T))))|F)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. We see `F&F`. This means False AND False, which is False.

So now we have `((l&(l&(!F)))&((l&((r|(!(l&F)))|(!((T|(T|T))&T))))|F))`.

2. Then we have `!F`. Not False is True.

This simplifies to `((l&(l&T))&((l&((r|(!(l&F)))|(!((T|(T|T))&T))))|F))`.

3.  We see `((T|(T|T))&T)`, which is True AND True (as or operation on true values results in true), so it simplifies to T. Since there is a negation symbol before it (!), `!((T|(T|T))&T)` becomes `!T` which results in F.  

This makes it `((l&(l&T))&((l&((r|!(l&F))|F))|F))`.

4. We see `l&T`. Any literal AND True remains same, so it just simplifies to l.

Now we have `((l&l)&((l&((r|!(l&F))|F))|F))`.

5. Again, we see `l&F`. Any literal AND False is always False.

This simplifies to `((l&l)&((l&((r|!F)|F))|F))`.

6. As we pointed out before, `!F` is T. So it simplifies to

`((l&l)&((l&(r|T))|F))`.

7. Any literal OR True is always True, so `(r|T)` simplifies to T.

`((l&l)&((l&T)|F))`.

8. As pointed out earlier, literal AND True simplifies to the literal itself. So, `l&T` simplifies to l. And, `l&l` simplifies to l. 

`(l&(l|F)).`

9. Any literal OR False is same, so `(l|F)` simplifies to l.

Anything AND F = F, so ((((c&c&c)|c)&c)&F) = F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (T & (F|T)) is equivalent to (T & T), since (F|T) means ""False OR True"", which is always True. So, the expression simplify to: ((((l|(T&F)|F)&T)&F)&((T|(T|(b&(T&(!(T|F))))))|F)). 

2. (T&T) would simply equal T. Therefore, the expression becomes: ((((l|T|F)&T)&F)&((T|(T|(b&(T&(!(T|F))))))|F)). 

3. (T|F) is also equivalent to T since it expresses ""True OR False"". Therefore, the expression becomes: ((((l|T)&T)&F)&((T|(T|(b&(T&(!T))))|F)). 

4. (l|T) would always be T, because it means ""a literal OR True"". Therefore, the implication becomes: ((T&T)&F)&((T|(T|(b&(T&(!T))))|F)).

5. Then (T & T) equals T, the expression becomes: (T&F)&((T|(T|(b&(T&(!T))))|F)).

6. However, (T&F) equals F. Therefore, the expression simplifies to: F&((T|(T|(b&(T&(!T))))|F)).

7. Evaluating (!T) gives us F, therefore the expression becomes: F&((T|(T|(b&(T&F))))|F)).

8. The operation (T&F) would be F, so the expression simplifies to: F&((T|(T|(b&F)))|F).

9. Similarly, (b & F) would also give F regardless of b, therefore we have: F&((T|(T|F))|F).

10. The clause (T|F) equals T so it becomes: F&((T|T)|F), and T|T is also T, so: F&(T|F). This clause also simplifies to T, so the whole clause becomes F&T, which is equal to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: The logical OR with True returns True and the logical OR with False returns the same variable. In addition, logical NOT of False and True results in True and False, respectively. So the internal operations can be simplified as the following,
(!(F|(T|T))&T) can be simplified as (!F & T) which becomes T.
Similarly, (T|(T&(!T))) becomes (T|F) which is True. So, (!(T&True) becomes !T.

Step 2: Replace these simplified operation in the main logic,
We get (b|(T&T)) & (F|!T), where we simplify the logical AND with True to return the same variable and logical AND with False returns False. So we get,

Step 3: Simplify the logic,
(b|True) & (F | !T) becomes True & (F | F) after replacing !T with F.

Step 4: Further simplify the logic,

2. For the AND operator, if both values are True, the result is True, otherwise it's False. As the first operand is q, everything depends on q here.
3. In the expression q OR (q AND T), the AND operator has higher precedence, so first evaluate q AND T, which is q because T (True) AND anything is that anything. So, this expression simplifies to q OR q, which again is q.
4. In the expression F AND T, the AND operator returns True if both operands are True, otherwise it returns False. Since F is False, this whole expression becomes False.

F|(F|(T|T)) = F (False OR (False OR True) equals to True). But, this combined with another False using a logical and. So, the expression becomes F&T = F (False AND True equals to False)

Replace these simplified operations in the original statement:

The expression (((T&(T|(!F)))&((F|(F&T))&T))|F)&F simplifies under the law as follows. 

!F simplifies to T, so our expression becomes:

(T&(T|T))&((F|(F&T))&T)

Which further simplifies to:

T&((F|(F&T))&T)

But, F&(F&T) simplifies down to F, changing our expression to:

T&(F&T)

But again, F&T simplifies to F, changing our expression to:

T&F

But T&F simplifies to F.

So, the whole expression simplifies down to

m & F & m, which simplifies to F. Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is False or F.",F,m

((c|(c&(F|(F|T))))&(s|(F|(((((T&F)|(T&F))&T)&((T&T)|F))|T)))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Both (F|T) and (((T&F)|(T&F))&T)&((T&T)|F)) are always True because (F|T) = T, ((T&F)|(T&F)) = F, (F&T) = F, (T&T) = T, so (((T&F)|(T&F))&T)&((T&T)|F)) = (F&T)|(T|F) = F|T = T.

2. Thus, (c|(c&(F|(F|T)))) simplifies to (c|(c&T)) which is just c.

3. Similarly, (s|(F|(((((T&F)|(T&F))&T)&((T&T)|F))|T))) simplifies to (s|(F|T)) which is s.

(((v|(F&T))&v)&(((((v|F)&((v|(F&F))|(T|(F&F))))|(v|v))|v)&v)).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (F&T) = F, because True and False together gives a False result. 
   So, v|(F&T) becomes v|F, which simplifies to v, because anything OR'ed with False retains its original value.

2. Similar to the first step, (F&F) in the expression becomes F. 
   Hence, (T|(F&F)) simplifies to T, because anything OR'ed with True results in True. 
   
3. Now, the expression (v|(F&F)) simplifies to v|F, which is v (as explained in the first step).

4. So, ((v|F)&((v|(F&F))|(T|(F&F)))) becomes (v&v) or (v&T) which simplifies to v because v AND v is simply v and anything AND'ed with True maintains its original value.

5. The expression (v|v) simply becomes v, because any value OR'ed with itself maintains its original value.

6. At this point, we have ((((v|F)&((v|(F&F))|(T|(F&F))))|(v|v))|v) simplified to v.

7. Now the given logic formula (((v|(F&T))&v)&(((((v|F)&((v|(F&F))|(T|(F&F))))|(v|v))|v)&v)) becomes v&v, which simplifies to v.

So the simplified version of the given logic formula is v.",v,v

((l|(l&T))|(l&((l&l)&(((l&((T|F)&(T&T)))&l)&((l&(l|l))&T))))).
A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, logical AND operation with True value does not change the other operand. So, ""(T&T)"" simplifies to T and ""l&T"" simplifies to l. Also, ""(T|F)"" simplifies to T (since OR operation with False does not change the other operand). So, the innermost expression is:

""((l&((T|F)&(T&T)))&l)&((l&(l|l))&T))"" = ""((l&(T&T))&l)&((l&l)&T))"" = ""((l&T)&l)&((l&l)&T))"" = ""(l&l)&(l&T)"" = ""l&T"" = ""l""

Also, ""l|l"" equals l, ""l&T"" is equals l and so, the whole formula simplifies to the following:

""((l|(l&T))|(l&((l&l)&(((l&((T|F)&(T&T)))&l)&((l&(l|l))&T)))))."" = ""l|l|l"" = ""l""

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Firstly, True or anything is always True. Therefore, (T|(F|F) simplifies to True.
2. Similarly, False and anything is always False. Therefore, (F&((T&(((g&F)&((p&F)|(T&F)))|(T|T))) becomes False.
3. Furthermore, not False is True. So !(F&T) simplifies to True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. For any literal value, the statement (o|T) will always be true as literal o 'OR' true is always true. Then we have [!(T&(...))].

2. In the second part, the statement (F&(...)) will always be false as ""false"" 'AND' any formula will be false.

3. (F|(!T)) and (F|F) are both false, so both (F&(s&(F|(!T)))) and (!((F|T)&(F|F))) are false.

4. Because both formulas connected by 'OR' are false, the entire formula within the 'AND' is false [(F&(s&(F|(!T))))|((F&(!((F|T)&(F|F))))&F) = F].

5. Thus, we have [!(T&F)], which simplifies to [!(F)] because 'AND' operation with false results in false.

6. Finally, we have [!(F)], the negation of false, which equals true (T). So, the given logic formula simplifies to T.",T,T
