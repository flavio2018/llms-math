A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (((c&c)|c)|c)|c) will be same as c because (c&c) = c so the whole expression would be c.
2. ((F&T)&T) will give False because F&T = F and then F&T = F.
3. !((F&T)&T) will give True because not of False is True.
4. Therefore, (((c&c)|c)|c)|((!((F&T)&T))|T) will give True because it is c or True which gives True.
5. Taking not of result from step 4 i.e. not True is False. Again taking not of False gives True. So, (!(!(F&(!(((((c&c)|c)|c)|c)|((!((F&T)&T))|T)))))) = True. 

Now, coming to the first part of the expression,
1. (x&(x|(x&x))|x)) will reduce to x. Here's how: x | x = x and x&x = x. So, the inner bracket would be x | x which gives x. Then x & x would again give x.

Now plug the values from step 5 and step 1 into the original equation, we get (x|x)|True.

   - F|T equals T, because True or anything equals True.
   - !F equals T, because Not False equals True. 
   - F&F equals F, because False and anything equals False.
   - F&T equals F, because False and anything equals False. 
   - (c&T) equals c, because True and anything equals to the latter.
   - f&F equals F, because False and anything equals to False.
   - In the case of ""or"" (|), if one operand is True, the result is always True. On other words, anything or True equals True.
   - Therefore, any expression having T as one of the operands with a logical ""or"" (|) would have True as its resultant value.
  
Our formula will now look like:

2. Continue to simplify:

   - (T|T|T)&F equals F, because True or anything is always True, and True and False equals False.

- (n|(F&((F|T)&F))) simplifies to n|F|F, as (F|T)&F becomes T&F, which is F and (F&...) is always F. Similarly, the result becomes n|F, which simplifies to n, as an OR operation with False doesn't change the value.
 
- (p&p)&T simplifies to p&T, as (p&p) is simply p. This is further simplified to p because T is the neutral element of AND operation.

- ((((p&p)&T)|T)|F) simplifies to p|T|F, using the above point, which simplifies to T|F, i.e. T because True OR anything is True.

- !((((p&p)&T)|T)|F) simplifies to !T, i.e. F because we negate True.

- F&(!((((p&p)&T)|T)|F)) simplifies to F&F, i.e. F because F AND anything is False.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","The first simplification we can make is to realize that, in a logical OR operation, if any value is True, the whole expression is True. So, wherever we have ‘T’ in an OR operation, we can simplify.

For example, ‘q|T’ simplifies to ‘T’ and ‘T|F’ simplifies to ‘T’. 
So ‘T|(F|(T&(F|F)))’ simply equals T. 

Next, we note that in a logical AND operation, if any component is False, the whole expression is False. For example, the simplified component ""(T|F)&F"" can be further simplified to ""F"". 

Apart from those, we can also simplify ""g|F"" to ""g"" and ""(g&T)"" to ""g"" because 'g’ (in general, any value) OR False is always 'g’ and 'g’ AND True simplifies to 'g’. FYI, 'g’ is either True or False, but we don't know the exact value.

Finally, as 'g' AND 'g' is simply 'g' we simplify ""(g&g)"" to ""g"".

After these steps, our expression becomes:
(d&(h|(q|((g|g)|T))))|(F&T)

Again, we simplify ""F&T"" to ""F"", ""(g|g)"" to ""g"" and the final expression becomes:
(d&(h|(q|g)))&T

3. (F|(F|(T|F))) is always True because it contains a True (T) condition in it which by logical or would give us True. Therefore, we can simplify (T|(F|(F|(T|F)))) to T.

• ""F | x"" will always be the same as x, because False OR anything is just that ""anything"".

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we can simplify any operation that involves F (False) and T (True) directly, these include:

- d|F simplifies to d, since anything OR False is equal to itself.
- F&F simplifies to F, since both conditions have to be true for an AND operation to be true.
- T&F simplifies to F, since both conditions have to be true for an AND operation to be true.
- F&T simplifies to F for the same reason.
- F|F simplifies to F, since at least one condition has to be true for an OR operation to be true.
- !F simplifies to T, as the NOT of False is True.
- F|T simplifies to T, since at least one condition has to be true for an OR operation to be true.

Therefore, the expression can be simplified to: 

((!((d&(((!e)&F)&F&((F&T)|F))))|T)

Which further simplifies to:

((!((d&(F&F&F))|T)

And then to:

((!(d&F))|T)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Step 1: Simplifying inner expressions.

Inner expression (F&F) simplifies to F (i.e., False AND False = False).

Inner expression (F&T) simplifies to F (i.e., False AND True = False).

Inner expression (T&F) simplifies to F (i.e., True AND False = False).

Innermost expression (T|(T|(!T))) is a disjunction involving True, another True and a negation of True which is False. Any disjunction that involves True is True. So, the expression (T|(T|(!T))) simplifies to T.

So we get ((((T|(F|(F|((F&F)&F)))|(F|T)))&T)|(!T))&F)&((F&F)|T) in the place of the original formula.

Step 2: Simplifying next level of expressions.

Expression (F&F) simplifies to F.

Expression ((F&F)&F) simplifies to F.

Expressions involving disjunction with T, like (F|T), simplifies to T.

So we will get ((T|T)&T|(!T))&F)&T in the place of the original formula.

Step 3: Simplifying next level of expressions.

Expression (T|T) simplifies to T.

Expression (!T) simplifies to F.

So we get (T&T|F)&F&T in the place of the original formula.

Step 4: Simplifying next level of expressions.

Expression (T&T) simplifies to T.
The resulting formula is T&F&T.

- !T is F (the negation of true is false)
- F&T is F (false and anything is false)
- T|T is T (true or anything is true)
- !F is T (the negation of false is true)

After replacing these we get:
((((((((F)&((F&F)&T))&(F))|F)&(r|T))|F)&T)|((p&(F)&F)).

Next, assuming the operation precedence is negation, and, or (from highest precedence to lowest), we simplify further:

- F&F is F (false and anything is false)
- F&T is F (false and anything is false)

Now we have:
((((((F)&(F))&(F))|F)&(r|T))|F)&T)|((p&F).

- (F)&(F) is F (false and anything is false)

We get:
(((((F)&(F))|F)&(r|T))|F)&T)|(p&F).

Then we continue simplifying:

- (F)&(F))|F is F (false and anything is false or false gives false)
- (r|T) is T (anything or true gives true)
- p&F is F (anything and false gives false)

So the expression becomes:

This can be simplified more:

- F&F is F (false and anything is false)

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, we'll simplify the inner parentheses where there are T and F values present. Specify that T (True) & F (False) is F since both need to be the same in and(&) operation. 
So, (((T&(T&F)) becomes ((T&F) which is F. 

Let's stick this back into our equation and simplify further:

((((l&(((w&(F|T))&w)|(!(F|(F&((T|F)|T))))))&l)&T)&(l|(F|(j&(v&F))))). 

In | operation, even if one value is true it gives T, therefore, T|F gives T. Also, ! operation inverses the value, !T = F and !F = T. 

Taking these observations, simplify (F&(T|F)|T and (!(F|(F&((T|F)|T)))) to T and T, respectively. 

Having these values, let's simplify the equation:

((((l&(((w&(T))&w)|T))&l)&T)&(l|(F|(j&F))))). 

Let's simplify (j&F)) = F because F(j=False) & any value gives F. 

Now, we get (((l&(((w&T)&w)|T))&l)&T)&(l|F|F) =((l&(((w&T)&w)|T))&l)&T)&l = ((l&((w&w)|T))&l)&T)&l = (l&(w|T)&l&T)&l = (l&w&l&T)&l  

Lets simplify further: (l&w&l&T)&l =l&w=l(w=True) & l. return to  ((l&(w=True)&l&T)&l) =

4. F & anything = F (Identity law for AND operation)

   (!(((o&o)&F)|(w|((!F)|(((j&((j|F)|j))|F)|(!(v&(l&(a&F))))))))).

3. Then simplify (a|F) which is ""a OR False"" and it equals to ""a"" and also Anything AND False is False, so (a&F) equals to F. So far we get:

   (!(((o&o)&F)|(w|((!F)|(((j&((j|F)|j))|F)|(!F)))))).

5. Then simplify (!F) which equals to ""True"" (as ! changes the value to its opposite).  And ""Anything OR True"" equals True (because OR requires at least one True value to be True). So now the expression becomes:
   (!(((o&o)&F)|(w|T))).

6. Simplifying further, (w|T) is also True. So now we have:

2. The double negation of a value is equal to the value itself, thus (!(!F)) simplifies to F. 

3. Any value ORed with False (X|F) is always the value itself. Thus, the portion (t|F) can be simplified to t.

4. Any value ANDed with False (X&F) is always False. Thus, the portion (x&x)&F simplifies to F and !!F simplifies to F. 

So, we have:

5. Also, any value ANDed with True (X&T) keeps the value itself, thus the expression can be simplified to:

3. `!T` simplifies to `F` because NOT gate with True gives False as `!T` => `F`, and `!F` simplifies to `T` because NOT gate with False gives True as `!F` => `T`.

2. Continue simplifying inner brackets: 
   Any value with NOT (represented by ""!"") in front of it switches its truth value. So, !F becomes T. 

   The formula becomes:

3. Continue simplifying current brackets:

   The formula becomes: 
   ((((T|((k&F)&F))|(!(w|(!s&s))))&T)&F).

4. Continue simplifying current brackets:

(T | (l | T)) => T (• because True OR anything is True)

Now, substitifying, we get:
(w & (!(T & T))) => w & F => F (• because undef & False is always False)

F & F => F (• because False & anything is always False)

For the next steps, let's remove unnecessary brackets:
((s & s) & s) => s (• because undef & undef & undef is equal to undef)

(s & s) => s (• because undef & undef is equal to undef)

Now we can substitify again:
(T | ((s | F) & s) & F) => (T | (s & s) & F) => (T | s & F) => T | F => T (• because True OR anything is True and False & anything is always False)

Last part is:

- Also, p AND F always equals F, and, p OR F always equals p (if ""p"" was True, the statement is True; if ""p"" was False, the statement is False). So, any statement like ""(F&((p|T)&F))"" or ""(F&((F&(F|F))&T))"" or ""(F&F)"" simplifies directly to F.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. (T|F), (d|F), (F|F) simplifies to T, d, F respectively.
2. Presumably, | (logical or) is a binary operation. So, the operation (a|(a&a)) can be simplified to (a | a) = a. Moreover, (x&F) is always F for any x. So, (x&(F|F)) simplifies to (x&F) = F.
3. Therefore, !((a|F)) becomes !(a) or !T, where ! means logical NOT.
4. Now, it looks like this !((v&v)|((((T)|((!(a))|(p|(F|T))))|F)|dT)).

Next, note that ""A&F"" or ""F&A"" is always False, and ""A|F"" or ""F|A"" is always equal to ""A"". This can simplify the formula to:

(o|((F&w)|F))|((f+T)&F)&!T)

This reduces to:

(o|(F&w)|((f+T)&F)&!T)

Next, you will notice that ""T&F"" is always False. Notice expressions like ""A|F"" or ""F|A"", it's always equal to ""A"". ""A|T"" or ""T|A"" is always True and ""A&!T"" is !T, since T is True:

(o|(F&w)&F)

“A&F"" or ""F&A"" is always False. Using this we get:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","We start by simplifying inner brackets whenever possible.

1. T&T = T. So the term ((T&(T&T))|T) simplifies to (T|T) which is T.
2. F&T = F. So ((T|T)&F) simplifies to F.
3. F|T = T. So the last part &(F|T) simplifies to &T.

This changes the given expression to ((a|F|T)|a|a)&T&(a&T). Now let's simplify this further.

4. F|T = T. So (a|F|T) simplifies to (a|T) which still results in T.

We thus get ((T|a|a)&T)&(a&T). Let's continue.

5. T|a = T. So ((T|a|a)&T) simplifies to (T&T) which is T.

In the logical NOT operation, NOT of True is False.

3. & r) | r) & r) simplifies to r because for the AND operator, when one operand is repeated in a row, the repeated value is ignored (in other words, r AND r is equivalent to r), and r OR r is also just equivalent to r.
4. (F | (!((T | (( !F) | (T & F))) & T))) is equivalent to F because T OR (!F) is T, T & F is F and anything OR F is the first thing. Therefore F | (!(T & T)) is F, because T & T is T and NOT T is F.

Third, the logical NOT operation flips the truth value, so !T is F. 

Hence, the formula can be simplified into ((t|t)&(T|F|F)), which is equivalent to (t&T) according to the defintion of logical OR (any False will not change the result).

5. succeeding (T&F) in the given expression are all OR-ed with T, which results in True since anything OR-ed with T is always true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Recall that any value ""or"" true (value | T) always gives true. Similarly, any value ""and"" false (value & F) always gives false. Also, the negation of true (!T) is false, and the negation of false (!F) is true. Hence, we can start simplifying step by step:

    - y|T = T
    - g|F = g
    - !T = F
    - F & F = F
    - F & T = F
    - t & F = F
    - T | t = T
    - F & T = F

2. So, the formula simplifies as below:

     - We have F on this part: ((T|((g|F)&(!T)))&(F&(F&T)))=F
     - We have T on this part: (T|(t&(F&T)))=T

     - So the full formula now looks like: !((y|T)|((x|(F))&(T)))

3. Continuing the simplification, we'll use again the fact that any value ""or"" true is true, and any value ""and"" false is false:

     - (y|T)=T
     - (x|F)=x
     - T & T=T

4. Hence, the formula now simplifies as below:

     - !((T)|(x&T))

5. Any value ""and"" true equals itself, thus simplifying the formula to:

     - !(T|X)

6. Since anything ""or"" true is true, we have:
