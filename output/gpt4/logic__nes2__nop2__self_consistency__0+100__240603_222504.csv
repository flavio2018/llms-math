(d|d) Simplifies to d because a value 'or' itself will still just be itself.

So, the formula simplifies further to (d|F).
Using the logic of 'or', if either of the values is true, the final outcome will be true. Since one of the values is d (which can be either True or False), if d is True, the final result is True. Even if d is False, 'or' F still simplifies to F itself.
