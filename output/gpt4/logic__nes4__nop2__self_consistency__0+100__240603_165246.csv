2. ""F | X"" is equal to ""X"", because if one part of an ""or"" operation is False, then the result is simply the other part. 
3. ""T | X"" is always ""T"", regardless of the value of X, because if one part of an ""or"" operation is True, the result is always True. 
4. ""F & X"" is always ""F"", regardless of the value of X, because if one part of an ""and"" operation is False, the result is always False.
5. ""| F"" and ""& T"" at the end of a statement have no effect and can be dropped.

q&q is equivalent to q because anything AND itself is simply itself. Substituting we get:
(q|(q&(q&q))).

The negation of $T$ i.e. $\neg T$ (!T) is always $F$ (FALSE). So, any expression with $\neg T$ becomes FALSE, hence $((!T)\&T)$ would be equal to $F$ (FALSE). But, ${(T|((!T)\&T))}$ this becomes $T$ (TRUE).
