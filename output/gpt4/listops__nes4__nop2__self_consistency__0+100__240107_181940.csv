A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, consider [SM 5 2]. This operation is sum modulo 10 of 5 and 2, so 5 + 2 = 7 
Next, [MIN 6 3] stands for minimum of 6 and 3, which is 3.
So, the first inner bracket [SM [SM 5 2] [MIN 6 3]] reduces to [SM 7 3] = (7 + 3) % 10 = 0. 

Then calculate [SM 4 1], which is (4 + 1) % 10 = 5.
Also [MIN 9 1] is minimum of 9 and 1, so it's 1. 
So, the next inner bracket [SM [SM 4 1] [MIN 9 1]] reduces to [SM 5 1], which is (5 + 1) % 10 = 6. 

This takes us to [MIN [SM 0 6]], which is minimum of 0 and 6, i.e., 0. 

Simultaneously, calculate [MAX [MAX 5 8] [SM 6 7]]. Here, maximum of 5 and 8 is 8. 
[SM 6 7] is sum of 6 and 7 modulo 10, so (6 + 7) % 10 = 3. 

Then [MAX 8 3] is maximum of 8 and 3, so it's 8. 

Now consider [SM 8 0] which is (8 + 0) % 10, so 8
Also [MIN 5 8] is minimum of 5 and 8, so it's 5. 

Then [SM 8 5] = (8 + 5) % 10 = 3. 
So, [SM [MAX 8 3]] = (8 + 3) % 10 = 1.

[MIN 1 2] = 1

[MAX [SM 3 4] [MIN 1 2]] solves to [MAX 7 1] = 7

Putting them together, [SM [SM [MAX 2 4] [MAX 7 1]] [MAX [SM 3 4] [MIN 1 2]]] evaluates to [SM 1 7] = 8 (1+7 mod 10 = 8)

Moving onto the left side of the expression:

[MAX 5 7] = 7

[SM 5 1] = 6 (5+1 mod 10 = 6)

So, [SM [MAX 5 7] [SM 5 1]] evaluates to [SM 7 6] = 3 (7+6 mod 10 = 13 mod 10 = 3)

Next, 

[MIN 8 0] = 0

[MIN 0 5] = 0

[min 8 8] = 8 (minimum between 8 and 8)
[max 8 3] = 8 (maximum between 8 and 3)

[sm 7 2] = 9 (sum of 7 and 2 mod 10)

[SM 2 9] = 1, since the sum of 2 and 9 is 11 and, taken modulo 10, it gives 1.

[SM 2 3] = 5, because the sum of 2 and 3 is 5.

[SM 3 3] = 6, as the sum of 3 and 3 is 6.

[MIN 7 7] = 7, since both numbers are 7 and hence minimum is also 7.

[SM 7 1] = 8, because the sum of 7 and 1 is 8.

[MIN 2 8] = 2, as 2 is the minimum between 2 and 8.

[SM 6 0] = 6, since the sum of 6 and 0 is 6.

[MIN 5 6] = 5, because 5 is the minimum.

[MAX 7 8] = 8, as 8 is the maximum.

[MAX 2 6] = 6, because 6 is the maximum.

Next, we have to calculate the following SM functions:

- [SM 1 3] = 1+3 = 4 (mod 10).

Continuing with the next SM function, [SM 4 4] = 4 + 4 = 8 (mod 10), since the sum does not exceed 10.

MIN 4 4 = 4 (the minimum of 4 and 4 which is 4),
MIN 0 1 = 0 (the minimum of 0 and 1 which is 0),
MIN 7 2 = 2 (the minimum of 7 and 2 which is 2),
SM 9 8 = 7 (sum of 9 and 8 modulo 10),
MAX 9 4 = 9 (the maximum of 9 and 4),
MIN 4 4 = 4 (the minimum of 4 and 4),
SM 9 2 = 1 (sum of 9 and 2 modulo 10).

So the expression becomes:
[MIN [MAX [SM 8 4] [MIN 0 2]] [MAX [MIN 7 9] [MAX 4 1]]]

Next step is: 
SM 8 4 = 2 (sum of 8 and 4 modulo 10),
MIN 0 2 = 0 (the minimum of 0 and 2),
MIN 7 9 = 7 (the minimum of 7 and 9),
MAX 4 1 = 4 (the maximum of 4 and 1),

So the expression simplifies to: 
[MIN [MAX 2 0] [MAX 7 4]]

This results to: 
MAX 2 0 = 2 (the maximum of 2 and 0),
MAX 7 4 = 7 (the maximum of 7 and 4)

So the expression is then:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we calculate the 'SM', 'MIN', and 'MAX' operations that are at the deepest level of brackets.

SM 2 8 equals 0 (2 + 8 = 10, 10 modulo 10 equals 0).
SM 4 7 equals 1 (4 + 7 = 11, 11 modulo 10 equals 1).
SM 6 5 equals 1 (6 + 5 = 11, 11 modulo 10 equals 1).
SM 1 9 equals 0 (1 + 9 = 10, 10 modulo 10 equals 0).
SM 5 3 equals 8 (5 + 3 = 8, 8 modulo 10 equals 8).
MIN 8 7 equals 7.
MAX 2 0 equals 2.
MAX 1 1 equals 1.

Now, let's replace these results back in the original equation:

Next, let's continue calculating 'SM', 'MIN' and 'MAX' operations from the deepest level of brackets:
MIN 0 1 equals 0.
MIN 1 0 equals 0.
MIN 8 7 equals 7.
SM 2 1 equals 3 (2 + 1 = 3, 3 modulo 10 equals 3).

Now, let's replace these back in the equation:

Let's continue calculating 'SM' at the deepest lever of brackets:

- [MAX 6 5] = maximum of 6 and 5 = 6
- [SM [MAX 4 4] [MIN 8 2]] = SM [4] [2] = (4 + 2) mod 10 = 6
- [SM [MAX 4 1] [MAX 5 6]] = SM [4] [6] = (4 + 6) mod 10 = 0

Then, replace these values in the original expression:

Calculate the SM and MIN operators:

- [SM 3 6] = (3 + 6) modulo 10 = 9 mod 10 = 9
- [SM 1 9] = (1 + 9) modulo 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0
- [SM 6] = 6
- [SM 0] = 0
- [MIN 6 0] = minimum of 6 and 0 = 0

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, find the minimum between 6 and 6, the minimum between 0 and 8, and the maximum between 7 and 6, which are 6, 0 and 7, respectively. 

Then find the maximum between the result 6 and 0, which is 6. Also, sum 1 and 1, which equals to 2.

Next, calculate the max of the 7 and the sum of 1 and 1 (which is 2), gives us 7. Sum the result of this and the previous maximum operation, which is the sum of 6 and 7. However, since we're dealing with the operation SM, we take the sum modulo 10, which is 13 mod 10, equals to 3. 

Moving on to the other side of the expression, find the maximum between 5 and 4 and the minimum between 1 and 1, that leaves us with 5 and 1. Then, find the minimum between 5 and 1, that will be 1. 

Next, sum 1 and 2, and find the minimum between 1 and 1, which is 1. Sum the results, which gives us 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.
