The negation of a true value (!T) is false (F). So you can simplify it to:

Logical OR operator (|) will provide a true output if at least one of its operands is true, and as s can be either true or false, having false (F) as the other operand changes nothing. So that simplifies to :
((s&s)&(!(F&(T&T)))).

And, logical AND operator (&) will provide a true output only if all its operands are true. So 's&s' just simplifies to 's'. Now we have:
(s&(!(F&(T&T)))).

Next, consider the internal AND operation: 'F&(T&T)'. An AND operation with a 'F' will always result false (F). So it simplifies the expression to:
(s&(!F)).

Finally, negation of a false (!F) is true (T), so the final simplification is:
(s&T).

q|(q&((q&q)&q)).

Further, anything AND itself is itself. Therefore, (q&q)&q simplifies to q. Inserting this into the formula yields:
q|(q&q).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","In logical operations, F (representing False) is like 0 and T (representing True) is like 1. 

Step 1:
  Break down (T&T). Its value is T because both are true. 

Step 2: 
  Substitute T from step 1 into the given expression, which becomes

  !((F|T)&(F&(d|T))). 

Step 3: 
  Evaluate F|T. The logical operator | (OR) means that if any one (or both) of the operands are true, the output is true. So, F|T is T.

Step 4:  
  Now, substitute T from step 3 into the given equation we have 

  !((T)&(F&(d|T))). 

Step 5: 
  Evaluate F&(d|T). The result of F & anything is F, because it's like a multiplication where False (or 0) will make everything False (or 0).

Step 9: 
  The logical operator ! (NOT) operates on only one operand. If the operand is true, it becomes false, and if it is false, it becomes true. So, the result of !(F) is T that is True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","Firstly, the phrase ""t|F"" means ""t OR False"". According to the semantics of logical OR, if t is True, then the entire expression t|F will be True. If t is False, then the entire expression will be False. Thus the phrase ""t|F"" simplifies to t.

So, the expression becomes:

((t|(t|t))&T)&(!F).

Next, the phrases ""t|t"" will be just True only if t is True. So, it simplifies to t. Then:

((t|t)&T)&(!F).

A similar logic goes so that ""t|t"" simplifies to t again:

(t&T)&(!F).

The phrase ""t&T"" will be True if both t and T are True. But since T is always True, then the entire expression ""t&T"" simplifies to t.

So, we get:

t&(!F).

Lastly, the logical negation of False is True (since !F equals to Not False), so:

t&T.
