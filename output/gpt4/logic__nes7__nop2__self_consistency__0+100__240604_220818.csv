A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. Since T represents True, and the result of AND operation with True is other operand itself, we can simplify the left inner parenthesis to y | ((!F)&T), which then simplifies to y | T.

2. Similarly, for the right side, ((c|c)&(F|T))&c)&T simplifies to c & T, which simplifies to c since AND with True results in the other operand itself. Further c|c|T simplifies to c|T, which is always T. Therefore, the right side is T.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, simplify the innermost parts.

Since anything AND False (F) is false, (d&F) simplifies to F. So, (T&(d&F)) is equivalent to (T&F) which simplifies to F.

The expression thus simplifies to: 

(((s&((F|F)&T))|(T&(T&F)))&(F&T)).

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, remember, | is OR, & is AND, ! is truth functional negation (ie: NOT), T is True and F is False.

Negations:
First of all, as we know that the NOT of False is True, and NOT of True is False.
So, (!T) can be replaced with F.
Then, (F&F) is obviously F as well, anything AND False is False because both must be True for the AND condition to be fulfilled.
And, NOT F = T. So, (!F) is replaced with True. The repeated negations nullify each other. So, !(!(!F)) = F.

Interpretations:
Next, for the ((((g|F)&T)&((!T)&T))|T) part,
since T OR anything is True, so, OR T with anything will result in T. Hence (('((g|F)&T)&((F)&T))|T) is replaced with T.

Remember, anything AND T is that ""thing"" itself (because AND is True only when both conditions are True), and anything AND F is False (because for AND to be True both conditions must be True). So, given that we've established that F&T to be F, it can be concluded that the entire middle part ((t|((((g|F)&T)&((!T)&T))|T))) can be reduced to (t|T), which as we know will be T, as T OR anything is True.

And, again, anything AND T is that ""thing"" itself (because AND is True only when both conditions are True).

So, finally we will have (u& T) | F, which after simplifying becomes u | F, which simplifies to the final result U, again, because anything OR F is that ""thing"" itself (because OR is True when either condition is True).

(((((d | (d & d)) | d) & d) | T) & (! (F | ((F & (F & T)) | F)))). 

2) Any boolean value or with the same boolean value remains the same, so (d | (d & d)) can be simplified to d:

((d & d) | T) & (!(F | ((F & (F & T)) | F))). 

4) Simplify (d&d) to d resulting in:
(d | T)&(!(F|((F&(F&T))|F)))

T & (!(F | ((F & (F & T)) | F))).

3. The expression !(e|(!F)) simplifies to False.
4. The expression i|(False) simplifies to i because if i is True, the expression is true, and if i is False, the expression is false.
5. On the right side of the equation, T|(F|((F&F)|(w&F))) can be simplified to true because we have True OR something. In context of logical OR operations, this is always True.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1) Let's understand the logic formula's easy-to-explain parts (!T, F&F, !T|T, and !T&T):

Not True (!T) equals False.

False and False (F&F) equals False. 

Not True or True (!T|T) is always True.

Not True and True (!T&T) can't exist, so equals False. 

2) Therefore, the transformed logic formula is:

((False)&((!(T|(False)))&((F|((True)&F))|T))).

3) The values inside brackets are simple to explain:

Not False or True (F|T) equals True.

Not True or False (T|F) equals True (because one part is True). 

4) Thus, the transformed logic formula becomes:

((False)&((!(True))&((F|(True))|T))).

5) We can further simplify:

Not True equals False.

And therefore, the transformed logic formula is:

((False)&((False)&((F|(True))|T))).

6) There's a simple rule for the logical 'and' operation:

False and any logic equals False.

Therefore, replacing anywhere where 'False&expression' is with a 'False,' the transformed logic formula becomes:

((False)&(False)).

7) And, the simplified version of this logic formula is:

False.

2. Substituting the previous result into the expression gives us: ((m&T)&(n|(F|(F|T)))&T)|T), which simplifies to (m&(n|(F|(F|T)))&T)|T.

3. (F|(F|T)) is always true because we have an OR operator and one of the operands is true (T). With this, our expression simplifies to (m&n&T)|T.

4. Since (m&n&T) will be either true (if all of m,n are true) or false (otherwise), and because an OR operation with true always yields true, (m&n&T)|T is always true (T).

5. The expression (!T)&T is always false because the negation (!) of true (T) is false (F), and an AND operation with false always yields false. Hence, the result is F&T which results in false (F).

6. The expression (F&T)|T represents the AND of false (F) and true (T) ORed with true. An AND operation with false always yields false. Hence, the earlier expression simplifies to F|T, which is always true (T).

5. Now the equation becomes: `(!((F)|(o|(c|(F|(!F))))))`.
6. `F|(!F)` will always be True because we're checking if either of two opposite conditions is true, it will always be true.
7. Now we can simplify it to: `(!((F)|(o|(c|T))))`.
8. As `c|T` is true, `o|(c|T)` is also true.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","1. This formula has a part `F|T`. Whatever the value of F is, `F|T` will always result in T, because logical or returns True if either one of its two operands is True.
2. !F means that the logical opposite of F is taken, which will always be T (as F is False).
3. So the inner part `((F|T)|(!F))|(F&T)` simplifies to `T|T` because of the two previous steps and because `F&T` is always F, and `F|AnyLogicalValue` is always the value of `AnyLogicalValue`. Thus `T|T` is of course T.
4. Hence the whole formula becomes `((((e&T)&T)|(k|T)))&T)|((e|e)|F)`.
5. The next simplification comes from `k|T`, which is always T. Therefore the formula then becomes `((e&T)&T)&T|(e|F)`.
6. Because `e|F` is always e (for the same reasons as before), the formula becomes essentially `((e&T)&T)&T|e`.
7. Now let's take a look at the part `((e&T)&T)`. The logical value of `e&T` can be either T or F, depending on the value of e. But in both cases, `((e&T)&T)` is essentially the logical value of `e&T` because `(T&T) = T` and `(F&T) = F`.
8. Therefore, the formula simplifies to `(e&T)&T|e`.
9. Here, the logical value of `(e&T)&T` is the same as that of `e&T` because `(T&T) = T` and `(F&T) = F`.

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, remember that anything ""or"" (!F) and ""and"" (F&T) with False (F), the result is still True (!F) or False (F&T). Using these rules, we simplify the formula in the following way.

Start with:

(!F) is always True (T). So we substitute:

We simplify any ""or"" with True (T) to be True, and ""and"" with False (F) to be False:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, we simplify ""F | F"" which is always false, and ""T & T"" which is always true.

So the formula then becomes: ((v | (F & T)) | (((v & v) & (T & (!F))) & T)) & (v & v)

As F & T is always false and T & (!F) is always true, we simplify again:

((v | F) | (((v & v) & T) & T)) & (v & v)

We simplify further to:

(v | F ) | ((v & T) & T) & v

Since v | F will always equal to v (since 'or' with false doesn't change the value), and v & T will always equals to v as well ('and' with true doesn't change the value), we simplify it further to:

3. The OR operation ""o OR o OR o"" is always equal to o, and ""u AND F"" always gives F (because F in an AND operation leads to False), so the formula reduces to:

Observation 1: Anything or-ed with False ""x|F"" results in the initial variable ""x"". This is because False is the identity element for the operation 'or'. 

Observation 2: True or-ed with anything ""T|x"" results in True. This is due to True being the absorbing element for the operation 'or'. 

Observation 3: Anything and-ed with False ""x&F"" results in False. This is due to False being the absorbing element for the operation 'and'.

Observation 4: Anything or-ed with itself ""x|x"" results in itself ""x"". This is due to the idempotent law in Boolean algebra. 

By applying the observations 1, 3 and 4, we can simplify ""t&((t|((T|F)&(t&F)))|(t|(t|F)))"" to be ""t&((t|F)|t)"" which simplifies further to ""t&t"" and finally simplifies to ""t"".

So, (((((y|(y|y))&T)&T)|T)&T) simplifies to T.

3) d|(F|F) simplifies to d: As F|F results in F, so expression simplifies to d|F, which should be 'd' because OR operation with False doesn't change the value.

1. ((x|F)&T)|x equals to (x&T)|x, since for any value of x, (x|F) is always x. Also, (x&T) is always x since we have T (true) for &. So this simplifies to x|x, which is x. 

2. So the result from the previous step gives us that !((((x|F)&T)|x)&F) is !(x&F), because we replace (((x|F)&T)|x) with x.
But for any x, (x&F) is always F, therefore it further simplifies to !F, which is T.

((!False)&((k|((False|(False|True))&True))&(((t|((!False)|(True|True)))&False)|False)))
