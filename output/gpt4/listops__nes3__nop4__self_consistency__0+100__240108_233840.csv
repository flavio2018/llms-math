Then, SM of 8, 1, 5, 6 results in (8+1+5+6)=20 modulo 10 which is 0.
Then, MAX of 9, 0, 1, 0 gives the maximum value 9.
Finally, SM of 9 and 9 results in (9+9) modulo 10 which equals 18 modulo 10 = 8.

For the second set of operations and numbers: [SM [MAX 3 3 9 6] 9 [MAX 4 2 3 6] 4],

Solve expressions happening inside the operators first starting with the innermost nested expression.

    [MIN 1 2 3 9] gives 1, for the same reason.

Step 2.
Continue breaking down the expression by using the operators:

    [MIN 1 8 4 7] gives 1.
    [MAX 1 4 0 8] gives 8.

Finally, we replace the values we've found:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, solve the operations in the innermost brackets.

For MAX 4 1 [SM 7 6 1 7]:
The operation SM 7 6 1 7 gives 21, but modulo by 10 you get 1 (21 MOD 10 = 1). Now you have MAX 4 9 1. Maximum amongst these numbers is 9.

For MAX 2 [MIN 9 3 8 6]:
The operation MIN 9 3 8 6 gives us the minimum number, which is 3. Now you have MAX 2 3 7. The maximum amongst these numbers is 7.

Now the original problem simplifies to: 
[SM 3 9 9 [MAX 9 0 5 0]] [MAX 7 [SM 7 2 5 9]]

Next, compute the inner operations:
For MAX 9 0 5 0, the maximum is 9.
For SM 7 2 5 9, the sum is 23. But, since we're operating modulo 10, it transforms to 3 (23 MOD 10 = 3).
Now the problem simplifies further to: [SM 3 9 9 9] [MAX 7 3]

Compute the remaining operations:
For SM 3 9 9 9, the sum is 30. But, since we're operating modulo 10, it transforms to 0 (30 MOD 10 = 0).
For MAX 7 3, the maximum is 7.

2. Calculate [SM 8 4 3 0] = 8+4+3+0=15, after mod 10 it equals 5.
3. Now, we can proceed to evaluate [SM 4 [MAX 3 5 9 3]] = 3 (from point 1) and 5 (from point 2) then 9 and 3 can compare and take the maximum value which is 9, and sum with 4 to get 4+9=13, after mod 10 it equals 3.
4. Calculate [SM 5 1 0 6] = 5+1+0+6 =12, after mod 10 it equals 2.
5. Calculate [SM 3 4 6 7] = 3+4+6+7 = 20, after mod 10, it equals 0.
6. Evaluate [MAX 9 2 0 8] = take the maximum number which is 9.
7. Finally use these calculated steps to solve the main statement [SM 3 9 5] = 3 (from point 3) + 9 (from point 6) + 5 = 17, after mod 10, it equals 7.

The expression now becomes:
[MAX 2 [SM 8 2 0 9] 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0]].

Now, execute [SM 8 2 0 9]. When executing SM, we add all the numbers together and get the remainder when divided by 10. Here, 8+2+0+9 = 19, so [SM 8 2 0 9] returns 9.

Expression: [MAX 2 9 1 [MAX 5 3 1 0].

Now, execute [MAX 5 3 1 0]. It returns 5, the maximum value.

Expression now is: [MAX 2 9 1 5].

Finally, execute this maximum operator. It compares all four values and returns 9, the maximum.

So, the final answer is 9.",9,9

Solve the following expression involving these operators:

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve [MAX 9 2 5 9], [MAX 3 0 7 5], [MAX 7 9 9 9] and [MAX 5 6 1 5]. The result will be the maximum value from each of the lists.

[MAX 9 2 5 9] = 9
[MAX 3 0 7 5] = 7
[MAX 7 9 9 9] = 9
[MAX 5 6 1 5] = 6

So, our main expression now looks like this:
[SM [SM 4 9 6 7] 4 [MIN 9 7 6 1] 1] 

Next, let's solve [SM 4 9 6 7] and [MIN 9 7 6 1]. 
- Remember that SM stands for sum modulo 10, so we simply add all numbers and take the result modulo 10. 
- MIN will select the minimum number from the list.

[SM 4 9 6 7] = (4 + 9 + 6 + 7) mod 10 = 26 mod 10= 6
[MIN 9 7 6 1] = 1 

Our expression is now simplified to:
[SM 6 4 1 1] 

Now, we just add all these numbers together and take the result modulo 10:
[SM 6 4 1 1] = (6 + 4 + 1 + 1) mod 10 = 12 mod 10 = 2

So, the solution to the expression is 2.",2,2

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's find the values of the MAX operations. MAX returns the maximum or highest value in the list.

MAX 9 2 4 6 = 9
MAX 8 2 4 0 = 8

Next, let's find the value of the MIN operation. MIN returns the minimum or lowest value in the list.

MIN 8 9 1 6 = 1

Now, execute the SM operations. SM sums the values and then returns that sum modulo 10.

SM 0 6 5 7 = (0 + 6 + 5 + 7) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

Now consider:

SM 2 7 8 1 = (2 + 7 + 8 + 1) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8

Then:

SM 9 8 1 8 7 4 8 = (9 + 8 + 1 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 8) mod 10 = 45 mod 10 = 5

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First, let's solve the inner MIN and SM functions. We have two MIN functions: 

MIN 8 0 6 1 = 0 (since 0 is the smallest number in the first list 8, 0, 6, 1)
MIN 0 3 2 5 = 0 (since 0 is the smallest number in the second list 0, 3, 2, 5)

We also have two SM functions:

SM 3 8 8 0 = (3 + 8 + 8 + 0) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
SM 6 9 MIN 7 3 5 4 8 = (6 + 9 + MIN 7 3 5 4 + 8) mod 10 = (6 + 9 + 3 + 8) mod 10 = 26 mod 10 = 6

Substitute these values back into the original equation, we have:

MAX 0 (MAX 0 4 0 4) (SM 6 6 7) 7 = MAX 0 MAX 4 6 7

Then, we calculate MAX functions:

MAX 4 = 4 (since 4 is the biggest number in the list 0, 4, 0, 4)
MAX 7 = 7 (since 7 is the biggest number in the list 4, 6, 7)

So the original equation becomes:

MAX 0 4 7 = 7 (since 7 is the biggest number in the list 0, 4, 7)

Therefore, the result of the original expression is 7.",7,7

A: Let's think step-by-step.","First calculate the innermost lists:

[SM 6 5 3 7] -> 6 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 21 -> 21 mod 10 = 1
[MIN 1 4 8 9] -> 1 (the smallest value among all values)
[MAX 7 9 [MIN 0 7 5 0]] -> MAX 7 9 0 -> 9 (the largest value among all values)
[SM 3 1 1 4] -> 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9 -> 9 mod 10 = 9

Next, simply compute the values inside the brackets:

MIN [3] = 3
SM [3] 1 8 [8] = (3+1+8+8) modulo 10 = 20 modulo 10 = 0.

Substitute these values back in:
